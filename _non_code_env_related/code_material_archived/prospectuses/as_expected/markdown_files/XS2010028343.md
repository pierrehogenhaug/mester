**€625,000,000 Deeply Subordinated Fixed Rate Resettable Securities**

guaranteed on a subordinated basis by

**SES Global Americas Holdings GP**

(established as a general partnership under the laws of the State of Delaware)

**Issue Price:** **99.409 per cent.**

The €625,000,000 Deeply Subordinated Fixed Rate Resettable Securities (the Securities) will be issued by SES S.A. (SES or the Issuer) on
27 May 2021 (the **_Issue Date) and, subject to “Terms and Conditions of the Securities – Substitution of Guarantor and termination of_**
_Guarantee”, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed on a subordinated basis by SES Global Americas Holdings GP (SES Americas or_
the Guarantor and the Guarantee respectively).

The Securities will bear interest on their principal amount from (and including) the Issue Date to (but excluding) 27 August 2026 (the First
**_Reset Date) at a rate of 2.875 per cent. per annum, payable annually in arrear on 27 August in each year, except that the first payment of_**
interest, to be made on 27 August 2021, will be in respect of the period from (and including) the Issue Date to (but excluding) 27
August 2021 and will amount to €7.247 per €1,000 in principal amount of the Securities. Thereafter, unless previously redeemed, the
Securities will bear interest from (and including) the First Reset Date to (but excluding) 27 August 2031 at a rate per annum which shall be
3.19 per cent. above the 5 year Swap Rate (as defined in the Conditions) for the Reset Period (as defined in the Conditions), payable
annually in arrear on 27 August in each year. From (and including) 27 August 2031 to (but excluding) 27 August 2046, the Securities will
bear interest at a rate per annum which shall be 3.44 per cent. above the 5 year Swap Rate for the Reset Period payable annually in arrear on
27 August in each year. From (and including) 27 August 2046, the Securities will bear interest at a rate per annum which shall be 4.19 per
cent. above the 5 year Swap Rate for the relevant Reset Period payable annually in arrear on 27 August in each year, all as more particularly
described in “Terms and Conditions of the Securities—Interest Payments”.

If the Issuer does not elect to redeem the Securities in accordance with Condition 9(h) thereof following the occurrence of a Change of
Control Event (as defined in the Conditions), the then prevailing interest rate per annum (and each subsequent interest rate per annum
otherwise determined in accordance with the Conditions) shall be increased by 5 per cent. per annum with effect from (and including) the
date on which the Change of Control Event occurred, see “Terms and Conditions of the Securities—Interest Payments—Step-up after
_Change of Control Event”._

The Issuer may, at its discretion, elect to defer all or part of any payment of interest on the Securities as more particularly described in
“Terms and Conditions of the Securities—Optional Interest Deferral”. Any amount so deferred, together with further interest accrued
thereon (at the interest rate per annum prevailing from time to time), shall constitute Arrears of Interest (as defined in the Conditions). The
Issuer may pay outstanding Arrears of Interest, in whole or in part, at any time in accordance with the Conditions. Notwithstanding this, the
Issuer shall pay any outstanding Arrears of Interest, in whole but not in part, on the first occurring Mandatory Settlement Date (as defined in
the Conditions) following the Interest Payment Date on which a Deferred Interest Payment (as defined in the Conditions) arose, all as more
particularly described in “Terms and Conditions of the Securities— Optional Interest Deferral—Mandatory Settlement”.

The Securities will be perpetual securities in respect of which there is no fixed redemption date, but shall be redeemable (at the option of the
Issuer), in whole but not in part, during the period commencing on (and including) 27 May 2026 to (and including) the First Reset Date or
on any Call Date thereafter (as defined in the Conditions), at the principal amount of Securities, together with any accrued and unpaid
interest up to (but excluding) such date and any outstanding Arrears of Interest. In addition, the Issuer may redeem the Securities, in whole
but not in part, on any date prior to 27 May 2026 at the Make-whole Redemption Amount as described in Condition 9(c) (Redemption of the
_Issuer (Make-whole)). In addition, upon the occurrence of an Accounting Event, a Capital Event, a Change of Control Event, a Substantial_
Repurchase Event, a Tax Deduction Event or a Withholding Tax Event (each such term as defined in the Conditions), the Securities shall be
redeemable (at the option of the Issuer) in whole but not in part at the prices set out, and as more particularly described, in “Terms and
_Conditions of the Securities—Redemption”._

The Issuer may, upon the occurrence of an Accounting Event, a Capital Event, a Tax Deduction Event or a Withholding Tax Event, at any
time, without the consent of the holders of the Securities, either (i) substitute all, but not some only, of the Securities for, or (ii) vary the
terms of the Securities with the effect that they remain or become, as the case may be, Qualifying Securities, in each case in accordance with
Condition 10 thereof and subject to the receipt by the Fiscal Agent of the certificate of the directors of the Issuer and any relevant opinions
referred to in Condition 11 thereof.

Subject to certain preconditions which are set out in “Terms and Conditions of the Securities – Substitution of Issuer”, the Issuer may at any
time substitute for itself as the principal debtor under the Securities, the Guarantor or any other member of the Group or a successor in
business of the Issuer. Further, the Deed of Guarantee (as defined in the Conditions) contains provisions which (i) allow the Guarantor at
any time to substitute itself for another entity in the Group or a successor in business of the Guarantor; and (ii) for so long as SES Global
Americas Holdings GP remains Guarantor, permit a termination of the Guarantee where (A) an order is made by any competent court or
effective resolution passed for the winding up or dissolution of SES Global Americas Holdings GP and such winding up or dissolution is
for the purposes of or pursuant to an amalgamation, reorganisation or restructuring while solvent and pursuant to which SES S.A. assumes
all of the assets, liabilities and obligations of SES Global Americas Holdings GP (and any such termination becoming effective upon the
relevant winding up or dissolution taking effect) or (B)(I) the Total Assets of the Guarantor represented less than 10 per cent. of the


-----

Total Assets of the Issuer; and (II) the EBITDA of the Guarantor represented less than 10 per cent. of the EBITDA of the Issuer in
each case as of the end of the previous two Fiscal Periods prior to the date of such termination. The Guarantor may only elect to effect any
such substitution or termination if certain other preconditions set out in “Terms and Conditions of the Securities – Substitution of Guarantor
_and termination of Guarantee” are satisfied as further described in Risk Factors—_ _The Guarantor may be replaced by another entity in the_
_Group or the Guarantee may be terminated._

The Securities will be unsecured securities of the Issuer and will constitute subordinated obligations of the Issuer, all as more particularly
described in “Terms and Conditions of the Securities—Status” and “Terms and Conditions of the Securities—Subordination”. The payment
obligations under the Guarantee will constitute subordinated obligations of the Guarantor, all as more particularly described in “Terms and
_Conditions of the Securities—Status of the Guarantee” and “Terms and Conditions of the Securities—Subordination of the Guarantee”._

Payments in respect of the Securities and under the Guarantee shall be made free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for, or
on account of, taxes of Luxembourg or the United States, unless such withholding or deduction is required by law. In the event that any such
withholding or deduction is made, additional amounts may be payable by the Issuer or the Guarantor, subject to certain exceptions as are
more fully described in “Terms and Conditions of the Securities—Taxation”.

Application has been made to the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the CSSF) in its capacity as competent authority under
the Luxembourg Act dated 16 July 2019 on prospectuses for securities, as amended (the **_Prospectus Law), for the approval of this_**
Prospectus for the purposes of Article 6 of the Prospectus Regulation. Application has also been made to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
for the Securities to be listed on the official list of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (the **_Official List) and admitted to trading on the_**
regulated market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (the Regulated Market). References in this Prospectus to the Securities being listed
(and all related references) shall mean that the Securities have been listed on the Official List and admitted to trading on the Regulated
Market. The Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s Regulated Market is a regulated market for the purposes of the Markets in Financial
Instruments Directive (Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, MiFID II)).

By approving a prospectus, in accordance with Article 20 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the Prospectus Regulation) and Article 6(4) of the
Prospectus Law, the CSSF does not engage in respect of the economic and financial opportunity of the operation or the quality and solvency
of the Issuer or the Guarantor or of the Securities to be issued hereunder.

This Prospectus has been approved by the CSSF as competent authority under the Prospectus Law and the Prospectus Regulation. The CSSF
only approves this Prospectus as meeting the standards of completeness, comprehensibility and consistency imposed by the Prospectus
Regulation. Such approval should not be considered as an endorsement of the Issuers or the quality of the Securities that are the subject of
this Prospectus and investors should make their own assessment as to the suitability of investing in the Securities.

The period of validity of this Prospectus shall be 12 months after the Prospectus has been approved by the CSSF. For the avoidance of
doubt, neither the Issuer nor the Guarantor shall have any obligation to supplement this Prospectus after the Securities have been admitted to
trading.

The Securities will initially be issued in registered form and represented upon issue by a registered global certificate which will be registered
in the name of a nominee for a common depositary on behalf of Euroclear Bank SA/NV (Euroclear) and Clearstream Banking, S.A.
(Clearstream, Luxembourg) on or about the Issue Date. Securities in definitive form will be issued only in limited circumstances (as
described in “The Global Certificate”).

The Securities are expected to be rated BB by S&P Global Ratings Europe Limited (Standard & Poor’s) and Ba1 by Moody’s Italia S.R.L.
(Moody’s) (each, a Rating Agency). As at the date of this Prospectus, the Issuer is rated BBB- (stable outlook) by Standard & Poor’s and
Baa2 (negative outlook) by Moody’s.

Each of Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s is established in the European Union and are registered under Regulation (EC) 1060/2009 (the
**_CRA Regulation). S&P and Moody’s also appear on the latest available update (as of 7 May 2021) of the European Securities and Markets_**
[Authority’s list of credit rating agencies currently available on its website (https://www.esma.europa.eu/supervision/credit-rating-](http://www.esma.europa.eu/page/List-registered-and-certified-CRAs))
[agencies/risk). A rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to suspension, reduction or withdrawal at](http://www.esma.europa.eu/page/List-registered-and-certified-CRAs))
any time by the assigning rating agency.

**Investing in the Securities involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors should have regard to the factors described under the**
section headed “Risk Factors” in this Prospectus.

-----

This Prospectus comprises a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation and for the purpose of
giving information with regard to the Issuer, the Guarantor, the Issuer and its subsidiaries taken as a whole (the
**_Group) and the Securities which, according to the particular nature of the Issuer, the Guarantor and the_**
Securities, is necessary to enable investors to make an informed assessment of the assets and liabilities, financial
position, profit and losses and prospects of the Issuer and the Guarantor, as well as the reasons for the issuance
and the impact on the Issuer and Guarantor. The Issuer and the Guarantor accept responsibility for the
information contained in or incorporated by reference in this Prospectus. To the best of the knowledge and
belief of the Issuer and the Guarantor, the information contained in this Prospectus is in accordance with the
facts and the Prospectus makes no omission likely to affect the import of such information.

This Prospectus is to be read in conjunction with all the documents which are incorporated herein by reference
(see “Documents Incorporated by Reference”). This Prospectus shall be read and construed on the basis that
such documents are incorporated in and form part of this Prospectus.

Other than in relation to the documents which are deemed to be incorporated by reference (See “Documents
_Incorporated by Reference”), the information on the websites to which this Prospectus refers does not form part_
of this Base Prospectus and has not been scrutinised or approved by the CSSF.

This Prospectus does not constitute an offer of, or an invitation by or on behalf of the Issuer, the Guarantor or
the Managers (as defined in “Subscription and Sale” below) to subscribe or purchase, any of the Securities. The
distribution of this Prospectus and the offering of the Securities in certain jurisdictions may be restricted by law.
Persons into whose possession this Prospectus comes are required by the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Managers
to inform themselves about and to observe any such restrictions.

For a description of further restrictions on offers and sales of the Securities and distribution of this Prospectus,
see “Subscription and Sale” below.

No person is authorised to give any information or to make any representation not contained in this Prospectus
and any information or representation not so contained must not be relied upon as having been authorised by or
on behalf of the Issuer, the Guarantor or the Managers. Neither the delivery of this Prospectus nor any sale made
in connection herewith shall, under any circumstances, create any implication that there has been no change in
the affairs of either the Issuer or the Guarantor since the date hereof or that there has been no adverse change in
the financial position of either the Issuer or the Guarantor since the date hereof or that the information contained
in it or any other information supplied in connection with the Securities is correct as of any time subsequent to
the date on which it is supplied or, if different, the date indicated in the document containing the same.

To the greatest extent permitted by law, the Managers accept no responsibility whatsoever for the contents of
this Prospectus or for any other statement made or purported to be made by a Manager or on its behalf in
connection with the Issuer, the Guarantor or the issue and offering of the Securities. Each Manager accordingly
disclaims all and any liability whether arising in tort or contract or otherwise (save as referred to above) which it
might otherwise have in respect of this Prospectus or any such statement.

The Securities have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
**_Securities Act). Subject to certain exceptions, the Securities may not be offered, sold or delivered within the_**
United States or to U.S. persons.

The Securities may not be a suitable investment for all investors. Each potential investor in the Securities must
make its own assessment of the suitability of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular,
each potential investor should:

(a) have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Securities, the merits
and risks of investing in the Securities and the information contained or incorporated by reference in
this Prospectus or any applicable supplement;

(b) have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its
particular financial situation, an investment in the Securities and the impact the Securities will have on
its overall investment portfolio;

(c) have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the
Securities;


-----

(d) understand thoroughly the terms of the Securities and be familiar with the behaviour of the relevant
financial markets and of any financial variable which might have an impact on the return on the
Securities; and

(e) be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for economic,
interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks.

The Securities are complex financial instruments and such instruments may be purchased by potential investors
as a way to reduce risk or enhance yield with an understood, measured, appropriate addition of risk to their
overall portfolios. A potential investor should not invest in the Securities unless it has the expertise (either alone
or with a financial adviser) to evaluate how the Securities will perform under changing conditions, the resulting
effects on the value of the Securities and the impact this investment will have on the potential investor’s overall
investment portfolio.

Prospective investors should also consult their own tax advisers as to the tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Securities.

The credit ratings assigned to the Securities may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to structure,
market, additional factors discussed above, and other factors that may affect the value of the Securities. A credit
rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold Securities and may be revised or withdrawn by the rating
agency at any time. A credit rating is not a statement as to the likelihood of deferral of interest on the Securities.
Holders have a greater risk of deferral of interest payments than persons holding other securities with similar
credit ratings but no, or more limited, interest deferral provisions. In addition, each of the Rating Agencies, or
any other rating agency may change its methodologies for rating securities with features similar to the Securities
in the future. This may include the relationship between ratings assigned to an issuer’s senior securities and
ratings assigned to securities with features similar to the Securities, sometimes called notching. If the Rating
Agencies were to change their practices for rating such securities in the future and the ratings of the Securities
were to be subsequently lowered, this may have a negative impact on the trading price of the Securities.
Moreover, if the status of the rating agency rating the Securities changes, EU and/or UK regulated investors may
no longer be able to use the rating for regulatory purposes and the Securities may have a different regulatory
treatment. This may result in EU and/or UK regulated investors selling the Securities which may impact the
value of the Securities and any secondary market.

The investment activities of certain investors are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, or review or
regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor should consult its legal advisers to determine whether
and to what extent (1) the Securities are legal investments for it, (2) the Securities can be used as collateral for
various types of borrowing and (3) other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of any of the Securities.
Financial institutions should consult their legal advisers or the appropriate regulators to determine the
appropriate treatment of Securities under any applicable risk-based capital or similar rules.

The following cautionary statements identify important factors that could cause the Group’s actual results to
differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made in this Prospectus. Any
statements about the Group’s expectations, beliefs, plans, strategies, objectives, assumptions or future events or
performance are not historical facts and may be forward-looking. These statements are often, but not always,
made through the use of words or phrases such as “will likely result,” “are expected to,” “will continue,”
“believe,” “anticipated,” “estimated,” “intends,” “expects,” “plans,” “seek,” “projection” and “outlook”. These
statements involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially
from those expressed in them. Any forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the
factors discussed throughout this Prospectus. Important factors that could cause these differences include, but
are not limited to: general economic and business conditions; industry trends; competition; launch delays or
failures; satellite anomalies, damage, failures or destruction; risks relating to insurance; exposure to key
customers; inability to renew existing contracts successfully; changes in technology; changes in government and
other regulation; changes in political and economic stability; currency fluctuations and other risks, including
those described in “Risk Factors” beginning on page 2 of this Prospectus.

Because the risk factors referred to in this Prospectus could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially
from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made in this Prospectus by the Group or on the Group’s
behalf, investors should not place undue reliance on any of these forward-looking statements.


-----

Furthermore, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and the Group
undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the
date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. New risk factors will
emerge in the future, and it is not possible for the Group to predict such factors. In addition, the Group cannot
assess the impact of each factor on the Group’s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of
factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements.

**In connection with the issue of the Securities, J.P. Morgan AG (the** **_Stabilising Manager) (or any person_**
**acting on behalf of the Stabilising Manager) may over-allot the Securities or effect transactions with a**
**view to supporting the market price of the Securities at a level higher than that which might otherwise**
**prevail. However, stabilisation may not necessarily occur. Any stabilisation action may begin on or after**
**the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offer of the Securities is made and, if**
**begun, may cease at any time, but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the issue date of**
**the Securities and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Securities. Any stabilisation action or**
**over-allotment must be conducted by the Stabilising Manager (or any person acting on behalf of the**
**Stabilising Manager) in accordance with all applicable laws and rules.**

**MIFID II PRODUCT GOVERNANCE / PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS AND ECPs ONLY TARGET**
**MARKET** – Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market
assessment in respect of the Securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Securities is
eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU, as amended
(MiFID II); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Securities to eligible counterparties and professional
clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Securities (a distributor)
should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to
MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Securities (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

**UK MIFIR PRODUCT GOVERNANCE / PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS AND ECPS ONLY TARGET**
**MARKET – Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market**
assessment in respect of the Securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Securities is
only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (COBS), and
professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (UK MiFIR); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Securities to
eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any distributor should take into consideration
the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product
Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the **_UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules) is responsible_**
for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Securities (by either adopting or refining the
manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS – The Securities are not intended to be offered,**
sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail
investor in the European Economic Area (EEA). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one
(or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the
meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended or superseded, the **_Insurance Distribution Directive), where_**
that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II.
Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the
**_PRIIPs Regulation) for offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors_**
in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them
available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation.

**PROHIBITION OF SALES TO UK RETAIL INVESTORS – The Securities are not intended to be offered,**
sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail
investor in the United Kingdom (UK). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more)
of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (EUWA); or (ii) a customer within the
meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the **_FSMA)and any rules or_**
regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify
as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of UK MiFIR. Consequently no key information
document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA

(the UK PRIIPs Regulation) for offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to retail
investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them
available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

far as the Issuer and Guarantor are aware, the transitional provisions in Article 51 of the BMR apply, such that
ICE is not currently required to obtain recognition, endorsement or equivalence.

**RISK FACTORS**

_The Issuer and the Guarantor believe that the following factors may affect their ability to fulfil their obligations_
_under the Securities. All of these factors are contingencies which may or may not occur. The risks discussed_
_below are those that the Issuer and the Guarantor believe are material, but these risks and uncertainties may_
_not be the only risks that the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Group face. Additional risks that are not known to_
_the Issuer, the Guarantor or the Group at this time, or that are currently believed to be immaterial, could also_
_have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s and/or the Guarantor’s and/or the Group’s business, financial_
_condition, results of operations, future prospects and the value of the Securities._

_Factors which the Issuer and the Guarantor believe may be material for the purpose of assessing the market_
_risks associated with the Securities are also described below._

_Any investment in the Securities involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors should carefully consider,_
_in light of their own financial circumstances and investment objectives, the following risks before making an_
_investment decision with respect to the Securities. If any of the following risks actually occur, they could have a_
_material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects_
_and the market value of the Securities may be adversely affected._

_Prospective investors should also read the detailed information set out elsewhere in this Prospectus (including_
_any documents incorporated by reference herein), consult their own professional advisers and reach their own_
_views prior to making any investment decision with respect to the Securities._

_For the purposes of the Risk Factors, references to SES and to the Group are to SES and its subsidiaries._

**Risks Relating to the Group’s Business**

**_The Group may experience a launch delay or failure or other satellite damage or destruction during launch,_**
**_which could lead to a total or partial loss of the satellite._**

Future launches may be delayed for a variety of reasons including the late availability of the satellite

for shipment to the launch site, the late availability of the launch service, unfavourable weather conditions or
last-minute technical problems arising on the satellite, the co-passenger satellite or the launcher. Launch failures
can occur due to a number of factors, including technical failure of the satellite or launch vehicle, and/or human
error.

A launch delay or failure could result in significant delays in the deployment of satellites because of the

need to secure another launch opportunity and, in the case of failure, to construct a replacement satellite, which
involves significant replacement cost (which may or may not be covered by insurance) and may take two years
or longer. Moreover, while it may be possible in some cases to transfer the launch to another launch service
provider, the limited number of launch service providers and the process of scheduling a replacement launch
may involve further delay and limit SES’s options. Failures or delays could also potentially cause the loss of
frequency rights at certain orbital positions, reduced satellite lifetime in the case of an incorrect orbit injection,
reduced functionality of the satellite, total loss of a mission and, to the extent that there are no other satellites
that can be readily redeployed to carry the traffic that had been contracted for the satellite that was lost, delays in
the onset of projected revenue streams or loss of revenue.

In addition, since commercial agreements signed ahead of launch generally include provisions allowing

a customer to terminate the agreement if the launch fails or delays or failures are not remedied before an agreed
date, any launch failure or delay could cause the Group to lose customers to competing satellite operators. Even
where launch failures or delays are remedied, such failures or delays could damage the Group’s reputation.
Satellite launch and in-orbit insurance policies generally do not compensate for lost revenue due to the loss of
customers to competitors because of interruption to services or for consequential losses resulting from any
launch delay or failure.

The occurrence of launch failures and launch delays could therefore have a material adverse effect on

the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group’s satellites may experience in-orbit destruction, damage or other failures or degradations in_**
**_performance that could impair the satellites’ commercial performance._**

Due to the nature of the environment in which they operate, satellites are subject to significant

operational risks while in orbit. One or more of the Group’s satellites may suffer an in-orbit failure ranging from
a partial impairment of commercial capabilities to a total loss of the asset. Satellite malfunctions, commonly
referred to as anomalies, can occur as a result of:

- the satellite manufacturer’s error, including an undetected design, manufacturing or assembly defect, or
the use of a new technology that proves to be faulty;

- problems with the satellite’s power systems, including circuit failures or other array degradation
causing reductions in the power output of the solar arrays on the satellites;

- problems with the satellite’s control systems; or

- general failures, including premature component failure.

Certain of the Group’s satellites have experienced, and may in the future experience, anomalies or

failures, which could lead to:

- a degradation in commercial performance;

- a reduction in transmission capacity;

- a reduction in the satellite’s operational life;

- outages;

- a reduction in the quantity of operating transponders; or

- the total loss of a satellite,

any of which could result in lost revenue until a replacement satellite is launched as well as increased expenses
to replace the satellite. In addition, to the extent that the Group has multiple satellites with similar designs,
problems experienced with one satellite may be experienced with other satellites.

In the event of a geostationary orbit (GEO) satellite failure, the Group may not be able to continue to

provide service to its customers from the same orbital position or at all, which could harm the Group’s
reputation and adversely affect its ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers. The Group has
an in-orbit backup strategy at certain key orbital positions where customers of an impaired satellite can be
transferred to another satellite in the Group’s fleet. In addition, the Group has in place a restoration agreement
with another satellite operator pursuant to which customers on an impaired satellite may possibly be transferred
to another satellite in that satellite operator’s fleet in order to protect continuity of service. However, there is no
guarantee that these mitigations will be effective, especially in the event of the failure of several satellites.

In the event of a medium earth orbit (MEO) satellite failure, a limited amount of in-orbit spare capacity

could be utilised to mitigate the loss, or alternatively, the satellites in the constellation could be re-phased in
orbit in order to allow operations to continue with a smaller number of active satellites.

The occurrence of any of the risks above could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business,

financial condition and results of operations.

**_The actual lives of the Group’s satellites may be shorter than their estimated initial design lives._**

The initial design life of a satellite is typically 15 years for GEO satellites and 12 years for MEO

satellites. The value of a satellite is normally depreciated on a straight-line basis over this period. In the event of
changes in the expected fuel life of the satellite, in-orbit anomalies or other technical or commercial factors, its


-----

actual life may be shorter than its design life. Under these circumstances, depreciation may be accelerated as
well as the lifetime revenue generated reduced, leading to a reduction in the return on investment for the asset.

**_The Group relies on a limited number of launch providers to launch its satellites._**

There are a limited number of commercial launch providers. The Group currently has launch services

contracts with Arianespace S.A. (Arianespace), Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) and United Launch
Services, LLC for satellite launches. Relying on a limited number of launch providers exposes the Group to
certain risks. For example, dependency on a small number of launch providers may reduce SES’s negotiating
power in relation to the fees it pays for satellite launches. In addition, the Group may experience significant
delays in launching new satellites in the event of a prolonged unavailability of a launch provider. The
unavailability of a launch provider could cause a global shortage in launch service capacity, which in turn could
have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group is primarily dependent on a small number of satellite manufacturers and secondary suppliers._**

SES is primarily dependent on six major satellite manufacturers for the construction of its satellites and

a small number of suppliers of key components of communications satellites (referred to as secondary
suppliers). Dependency on a small number of satellite manufacturers and secondary suppliers may reduce the
Group’s negotiating power and access to advanced technologies, which may only be available from certain
suppliers. This dependence may also result in a higher concentration of risk. SES may experience significant
delays in procuring new satellites in the event of prolonged problems, operational difficulties or financial
difficulties at one of these satellite manufacturers. Further, the difficulties caused by any technical problems
with the design of a particular model of satellite may be multiplied if several satellites of that design are
purchased. SES may experience significant delays in acquiring and launching new satellites in the event of
prolonged problems at one of its secondary suppliers.

The occurrence of the defects or delays described above could have a material adverse effect on the

Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Satellites may be subject to damage or loss from events that might not be covered by insurance policies._**

SES maintains pre-launch, launch and initial in-orbit insurance, as well as third party liability insurance

for its satellites. SES also maintains in-orbit insurance for its satellites that have book value. The insurance
policies generally contain exclusions from losses resulting from:

- military or similar action;

- any anti-satellite device;

- electromagnetic and radio interference (except for physical damage to a satellite directly resulting from
this interference);

- confiscation by any governmental body;

- insurrection and similar acts or governmental action to prevent such acts;

- nuclear reaction or radiation contamination;

- wilful or intentional acts by the insured causing the loss or failure of satellites;

- terrorism; and

- cyber-attacks.

Furthermore, these insurance policies do not provide compensation for business interruption, loss of

market share, reputational damage, incidental and consequential damages and similar losses that might arise
from the failure of a satellite launch, incorrect orbital placement or the failure of a satellite to perform according
to specifications and the in-orbit insurance only covers losses in excess of the potentially high-risk retention


-----

level or deductible selected by SES. SES self-insures up to the retention level or deductible. In addition, the
Group’s third-party liability insurance (which covers losses arising from third party bodily injury and property
damage caused by, amongst other things, launch failures and satellite collisions) is subject to a single limit of
€500 million of coverage for any one occurrence.

The Group’s insurance policies do not cover loss of revenue. Furthermore, SES will not be fully

reimbursed if the cost of a replacement satellite exceeds the sum insured. As a result of such exclusions and
compensation and risk level arrangements, SES could be exposed to significant losses under any of the
circumstances specified above or if it has inaccurately estimated the appropriate risk retention level.

In addition, SES will not be reimbursed under the in-orbit insurance policies other than for a major

event because isolated minor incidents relating to defects may fall within SES’s insurance policy deductibles.
Losses arising from any of the factors above could result in material increases in costs or reductions in expected
revenue and profits, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_A portion of the Group’s in-orbit insurance policies are maintained through self-insurance._**

SES has adopted a policy of limited self-insurance for in-orbit insurance. Insurance of SES’s fleet is

provided by two wholly-owned subsidiaries that re-insure part of the risk with external insurance companies,
which reduces the amount of insurance premiums paid to such insurance companies, but leaves the Group with
exposure in the event of loss. Although SES self-insures only a chosen aggregate deductible as well as amounts
above a certain aggregate limit of insurance, and external insurance policies cover losses in excess of the
aggregate deductible up to the limit of insurance, the Group retains significant risk both below and above those
thresholds.

If any event occurs that is covered by the in-orbit self-insurance deductible, it would not be

compensated by an outside insurer and thus there could be a material increase in the Group’s costs, which would
decrease profits and could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results
of operations.

**_The Group may not be able to obtain adequate insurance or the desired level of coverage, and insurance_**
**_premiums may increase._**

Satellite insurance is a cyclical market and the price, terms and availability of satellite insurance has

fluctuated over the years. Losses experienced by this market in recent years have resulted in a significant
hardening of market conditions, which could result in increases in the amount of insurance premiums paid by
SES to cover its risks and affect its ability to obtain the desired levels of coverage. This would in turn increase
the Group’s costs and have an adverse effect on its business, risk profile, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_The Group may not be successful in renewing its existing commercial agreements, or in renewing them on_**
**_terms that are similar to their current terms._**

The Group’s commercial contracts vary in length depending on the type of customer. Contracts with

video customers tend to be longer-term, with typical durations of five to seven years (and up to 15 years in
certain cases) for customers in North America and Europe, and between three to five years for customers in
developing markets. Contracts with data customers are typically one to five years in length, and contracts with
governmental customers depend on the type of service and can vary from one to ten years in duration. If SES is
unsuccessful in obtaining the renewal of its commercial agreements when they come up for renewal or is unable
to obtain commercial terms similar to those currently reflected in its agreements, such as due to budget cuts
affecting governmental or other customers, revenue could be adversely affected for some time.

The inability to renew commercial agreements on terms as favourable as existing agreements could

have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

**_The Group has several large customers, the loss of any of which could materially reduce the Group’s revenue_**
**_and materially adversely affect the Group’s business._**

The Group generates its revenue primarily from commercial agreements to provide satellite

transponder capacity and associated services and solutions to its customers. Certain customers have major or
significant contracts with the Group. The Group’s ten largest commercial customers represented 33.1 per cent.
of the Group’s revenue in 2020. However, the Group’s customer base is subject to constant change, both in
terms of volume and type of service purchased. Some of the Group’s major customers could decide not to renew
their contracts, seek to renew them on scope or terms that are less favourable to the Group or, where a contract
contains an early-termination right, to terminate a contract before the end of its term. Moreover, because of the
typically long-term nature of some material satellite capacity contracts and the costs to customers of switching
providers, if a customer decides not to renew an agreement (for example, as the result of developing or
increasing relationships with other operators or moving to other telecommunications solutions), it may be a
number of years before the Group has the opportunity to win back or replace the business. Also, if key
customers reduce their reliance on SES by developing or increasing relationships with other satellite solution
providers (or moving to other telecommunications solutions) and such key customer cannot be replaced, SES’s
revenue may be impacted negatively.

In addition, key customers may go bankrupt or combine with other customers in mergers and

acquisitions. Consolidation in the industries in which the Group’s customers operate may increase their
bargaining power and leverage when negotiating agreements with the Group, leading to pressure on pricing.
Budget cuts may also be imposed on SES’s governmental customers.

The loss of large customers or the reduction in demand for services from customers for any of the

reasons above could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_The Group is exposed to general customer counterparty risk._**

The Group is exposed to risks associated with the financial condition of its customers and their ability

to fulfil their contractual obligations. If any customer experiences financial difficulties or fails to fulfil its
contractual commitments to the Group, the Group may incur costs enforcing its contractual rights and may incur
significant losses. The Group has a number of customer contracts where the customer’s payments to the Group
are scheduled towards the end of the contractual term but the revenue is recognised in the Group’s accounts on a
linear basis under IFRS accounting standards. As a result, if a customer experiences financial difficulties or fails
to fulfil its contractual commitments to the Group, the Group may not only fail to receive the revenue due from
the customer but may also have to record a loss to offset the revenue already recognised in its financial
statements.

The level of customer credit risk faced by the Group may increase as it grows revenue in developing

markets because credit risk tends to be higher in these markets (compared to the markets of Europe and North
America). Any failure of the Group’s customers to fulfil their contractual commitments to the Group could have
a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group’s operations and systems are subject to external threats, including sabotage, terrorist attacks and_**
**_natural disasters._**

As a satellite operator, SES is subject to a number of risks that could impair its operations and systems,

including sabotage, terrorist acts, piracy, attack by anti-satellite devices, jamming, unintentional interference and
natural disasters.

The risks of terrorist attacks are beyond SES’s control and such an attack could cause substantial

damage to the Group’s network. In addition, natural disasters could damage or destroy the Group’s earth
stations, resulting in a disruption or termination of service to its customers. Although the Group takes measures
to prevent the effects of such natural disasters, such as using technology to safeguard antennas and to protect
earth stations during natural disasters such as a hurricane, there is no guarantee that the measures will be
effective.


-----

Such occurrences are generally excluded from the Group’s insurance coverage. For further information,

see “—Satellites may be subject to damage or loss from events that might not be covered by insurance policies”
above.

The occurrence of any of these risks may lead to a temporary or permanent interruption in service

and/or result in a loss of customers, reputational damage or reduced revenue, any of which could have a material
adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group relies on information systems, satellite control and operations networks and other technology, and_**
**_a disruption or failure of such systems, networks or technology as a result of unauthorised access,_**
**_misappropriation of data or other malfeasance may disrupt the Group’s business._**

Since information systems, satellite control, operations and communication networks and other

technologies are critical to the Group’s operating activities and the fulfilment of its commercial obligations to its
customers, disruptions or shutdowns caused by events such as computer hacking, malware, dissemination of
computer viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software and other malicious activity or forms of
cyberattack pose significant risks. Due to the fast-moving pace of technological advancements, the high
sophistication of certain attackers and an increasingly hostile cyberattack environment, it may be difficult to
detect, determine the scope of, contain and remediate every such event. Any such event could have an adverse
impact on the Group’s operations, including service disruption or malfunctions, loss of customers, noncompliance with legal and regulatory requirements, inadvertent violations of data protection, export control and
other relevant laws, damage to the Group’s reputation or result in damage to the Group’s properties, equipment
and data. Such an event also could result in large expenditures necessary to repair or replace such networks or
information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future. Third parties may also experience
errors or disruptions that could adversely impact the Group’s business operations and over which the Group has
limited control.

SES has been the target of cyberattacks in the past. While the impact of such attacks has not been

significant to date, there can be no assurance that any future attacks would not have a material effect on the
Group’s business. Any inability to prevent the occurrence of cyberattacks could result in a disruption to
services, malfunctions and/or inadvertent violations of data protection and other relevant laws and regulations.
In addition, commercial satellite companies have been the victims of a number of attempts to intentionally jam
broadcasts from their satellites. Such attempts could lead to disruptions in service, which could have a material
effect on revenue and/or cause reputational damage.

In addition, the Group’s operating activities could be subject to risks caused by misappropriation,

misuse, leakage, falsification and accidental release or loss of information maintained in the Group’s
information technology systems and networks, including customer, partner, personnel and vendor data. The
Group could be exposed to significant costs, fines and penalties if such risks were to materialise, and such
events could damage the Group’s reputation and credibility and have a negative impact on its revenue.

The occurrence of any such events or security breaches could have a material adverse effect on the

Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group’s international operations are subject to a number of risks that could negatively affect future_**
**_operating results or subject the Group to criminal and civil enforcement actions._**

SES conducts business around the world. International business is subject to a variety of risks,

including:

- lack of developed and/or independent legal systems to enforce commercial, legal and regulatory rights;

- greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles;

- foreign currency exchange volatility;

- inflation and deflation;

- fraud and political corruption;


-----

- anticompetitive or protectionist behaviour;

- uncertain and changing tax rules, regulations and rates;

- logistical and communication challenges; and

- economic, political and financial conditions in the markets in which the Group operates;

In addition, SES may be subject to civil or criminal liability under the U.S., United Kingdom, EU,

Canada and other laws and regulations pertaining to economic sanctions, export controls, competition and antibribery requirements. SES has procedures, policies and controls in place that are designed to detect and prevent
instances of non-compliance with such requirements. There have nonetheless been a few instances when SES
has identified activities that may have constituted violations of applicable requirements. For example, SES has
previously submitted a voluntary self-disclosure report to OFAC (for more information see “Regulation—The
_United States—U.S. Export Controls and Sanctions Regulations”). In such circumstances, SES has taken prompt_
action to investigate and remediate such activities and to adjust its controls to prevent such occurrences in the
future. Any failure by SES to obtain or maintain required licences and authorisations or failure to comply with
sanctions, export control, competition and anti-bribery laws and regulations may render it impossible for SES to
provide satellite capacity and services to certain countries or customers and potential customers. Further, any
failure by SES to obtain or maintain required licences and authorisations or failure to comply with sanctions,
export control, competition, and anti-bribery laws and regulations may render it impossible for SES to provide
satellite capacity or services to countries that are subject to sanctions, to purchase satellites and equipment from
certain vendors (including U.S. manufacturers and suppliers), restrict SES’s ability to conduct business with
U.S. government entities, expose the Group and its employees to significant fines and other penalties and/or
cause reputational damage. Additionally, the failure of the Group’s vendors or suppliers to obtain the necessary
export and other authorisations could affect SES’s ability to acquire, launch or operate satellites.

Risks and violations of international and national laws and regulations may negatively affect future

operations or subject the Group to criminal or civil enforcement actions, including potential financial penalties.
Although the Group has policies and procedures to monitor and address legal and regulatory compliance, there
can be no guarantee that such policies and procedures will prevent all violations of applicable regulations.
Moreover, there can be no guarantee that the Group’s employees or agents will not violate these requirements or
will not engage in activities that result in the Group’s direct or indirect violation of such applicable regulations.

See _“—Risks Relating to Regulation—The Group is subject to export control laws including those of_

_the United States, which may preclude exporting satellites for launch, satellite-related hardware, technology,_
_data and services or preclude sourcing these items in the United States” below for further information._

SES’s business with the U.S. government is subject to U.S. national security laws and regulations. As a

result of the indirect ownership by a non-U.S. parent company and the classified nature of its business, SES
Government Solutions, Inc. (SESGS) is subject to a proxy agreement (the **_Proxy Agreement) with the U.S._**
government. The imposed proxy structure is common practice for businesses serving certain segments of the
U.S. government. The Proxy Agreement places strict limitations on the information that may be shared between
SESGS and SES and its subsidiaries. The Proxy Agreement also imposes various restrictions on the control of
SESGS by SES. In particular, the Proxy Agreement places strict limitations on control by SES. SESGS operates
under the leadership of an independent proxy board approved by the U.S. Department of Defense. SES’s
internal controls and SES’s internal audit may not be fully effective or implemented due to the restrictions
imposed by the Proxy Agreement. Further, a breach of the Proxy Agreement could place all or part of the
SESGS business with the U.S. government at risk.

The occurrence of any of the risks above could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business,

financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group’s operations are subject to external threats such as COVID-19_**

The Group’s business requires that certain operational functions are performed on site. During a

pandemic such as the one caused by the Coronavirus (COVID-19), the availability of operators could be reduced
due to any of (i) their having tested positive for the virus, (ii) their having had a known exposure to one or more
people that have either tested positive for the virus or have symptoms which suggest they may have the virus, or


-----

(iii) their having symptoms which are similar to the virus (meaning they need to self-quarantine until they have
established whether or not they have the virus). The occurrence of any of the above could result in a lack of
operators available to carry out the Group’s operational activities. Moreover, Governments may not allow those
changes in shift patterns deemed necessary by management to address a potential lack of operators. Even where
certain Group operations can be carried out remotely (which is not the case for all of the Group’s operations), a
failure of the Group’s IT Systems may prevent employees that are working remotely from performing the
necessary functions as planned – see further “The Group relies on information systems, satellite control and
operations networks and other technology, and a disruption or failure of such systems, networks or technology
as a result of unauthorised access, misappropriation of data or other malfeasance may disrupt the Group’s
business.”

In addition to the risk of a direct operational impact on the Group, the COVID-19 pandemic has

dampened economic activity and eroded financial conditions worldwide. Governments and public bodies in
affected countries have introduced and continue to introduce emergency public measures such as travel bans,
quarantines, and public lockdowns.

Whilst the full impact of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis remains impossible to predict with a high

degree of certainty, as at the date of this Prospectus, overall, COVID-19 is having a pronounced short and
medium-term impact on the Group, significantly challenging the contract base, renewals and dampening growth
across the Group’s Mobility, Energy and Government segments, as well as stretching cash flows across much of
the industry, and accelerating a restructuring / consolidation process in some parts of the sectors the Group
serves. To the extent the worldwide economy continues to be impacted and does not rebound quickly, then there
could continue to be an impact on demand for the Group’s products and services, as its customers (who are
based around the world) may themselves be adversely impacted by COVID-19 and so reduce their spending –
see further “Business - Recent Developments – COVID-19” below.

All of the above could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business and financial condition.

**Risks Relating to the Group’s Strategic Development**

**_The Group is exposed to risks inherent in doing business in developing markets._**

The Group’s development strategy involves targeting new geographical areas and developing markets,

such as in Africa, Latin America and Asia and potentially developing joint ventures or partnerships with local
telecommunications, media and financial businesses in such markets in order to improve market access for its
services.

Expansion into these regions may not be successful, and even if successful, SES is exposed to the

inherent risks of doing business in those regions, such as instability arising from political or economic factors or
differences in legal and regulatory regimes. See “—Risks Relating to the Group’s Business—The Group’s
_international operations are subject to a number of risks that could negatively affect future operating results or_
_subject the Group to criminal and civil enforcement actions” above. Such instability could cause difficulties in_
the Group’s ability to operate, increase costs or lead to an unexpected reduction in the demand for the Group’s
services. In addition, in some developing markets, customers may be less financially secure and run a higher
risk of insolvency than in more developed markets. The failure of a customer to make payments for the Group’s
services or honour its agreements would lead to a reduction in the Group’s revenue. Protectionist policies on
foreign satellite capacity (national operator preference) as well as sanction regimes in certain countries pose
further risks, mainly in developing markets.

The occurrence of any of the risks above could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business,

financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group is subject to general risks associated with its strategic investments._**

The Group has a number of strategic investments that it does not fully control and may enter into

similar arrangements in the future. As a result, the Group is dependent in part on the cooperation of other
investors and partners in protecting and realising the full potential of certain investments. The Group may not be
able to prevent strategic partners from taking actions that are contrary to the Group’s business interests or
objectives or are inconsistent with the Group’s views of what is the best strategy for the investment. In certain


-----

circumstances, it may become necessary for the Group to invest further funds or fulfil its contractual
obligations, or the Group may be restricted from realising the value of its investment.

Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and

results of operations.

For more information about the Group’s strategic investments, see “Business—Strategic Investments”.

The Group is exposed to the risk of increasing the sales of lower margin value-add services compared

to the typically higher margin satellite capacity sales.

The Group’s development strategy includes an increased focus on sales of value-add services to

counter competition and commoditisation of traditional satellite capacity sales. An unsuccessful execution of
this strategy may lead to significantly higher costs, that may not be compensated by identical or higher revenues,
or the loss of operational efficiency, leading to customer dissatisfaction.

Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and

results of operations.

**_Forward-looking information included in this Prospectus may differ materially from actual results and_**
**_investors should not place undue reliance on it._**

The forward-looking information set forth in this Prospectus regarding SES represents SES’s current

view of such information and is based on assumptions including, but not limited to, issues not arising
concerning satellite health; satellite launches occurring when anticipated; no changes to prevailing global
macroeconomic and political conditions (in particular where SES has significant levels of operation); no
deterioration in the financial condition or solvency of SES’s key customers; no change in market conditions
within the satellite industry, including in relation to customer demand or competitive environment; no change in
currency exchange rates between the euro and the currencies in which the Group operates (including, most
significantly, the U.S. dollar); no changes in inflation, interest or tax rate assumptions in SES’s principal
markets compared with SES’s budgeted estimates; no adverse event impacting SES’s financial performance; no
changes in legislation or regulatory requirements, including accounting principles or materiality thresholds; the
conclusion of negotiations for new and renewed capacity agreements in line with SES’s expectations; and no
material issues arising in respect of SES’s contracts. While any forward-looking information contained in this
Prospectus is based on the assumptions that SES currently believes are appropriate, it is inevitable that there is a
degree of uncertainty relating to any forward-looking revenue, performance and trend information. Such
information should therefore be read in this context and construed accordingly.

The assumptions on which forward-looking information is based are inherently subject to significant

business, operational, economic, market and other risks, many of which are outside of SES’s control.
Accordingly, such assumptions may change, potentially materially, or the expected effects of these assumptions
may not materialise at all. In addition, unanticipated events may adversely affect the actual results that SES
achieves in future periods whether or not its assumptions relating to the forward-looking information for future
periods otherwise prove to be correct. As a result, SES’s actual results may vary materially from the forwardlooking information included in this document, and investors should not place undue reliance upon it.

**_The Group may not be able to retain and/or attract personnel who are critical to the Group’s business._**

SES has a number of key employees with highly specialised skills and extensive experience in their

fields. If several of these employees were to leave, SES may have difficulty replacing them immediately. The
risk of the loss of key employees may increase as SES continues with organisational changes. Although SES
operates retention programmes, in-house back-up solutions, knowledge transfer, succession planning and
development plans, there can be no assurance that SES would be successful in hiring and training suitable
replacements without undue costs or delays.

If SES is unable to retain key employees or attract new highly qualified employees, it could have a

negative impact on SES’s business, financial situation and results.


-----

**_Pursuing external growth opportunities may not yield the expected benefits._**

As part of its strategy, the Group regularly evaluates opportunities to make strategic acquisitions or to

increase its stake in ventures in which it currently has an interest. Such growth opportunities may not yield the
expected benefits due to a number of factors, some of which are not entirely within the Group’s control, such as
associated costs, regulatory approvals, antitrust reviews, diversion of management time and challenges posed by
integration operations. In addition, the Group may fail to obtain, in a timely manner, the necessary financing on
satisfactory terms to allow the transaction to proceed. Acquisitions also may adversely affect the Group’s
financial ratios as a result of related financing incurred or the performance of the acquired business following
the acquisition. The Group may incur significant costs arising from its efforts to pursue strategic acquisitions
which exceed the returns realised. Failure to pursue or complete strategic growth opportunities may prevent the
Group from growing the business, which could in turn result in a material adverse effect on the Group’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Risks Relating to the Satellite Communications Market**

**_The telecommunications market is highly competitive and SES faces competition from satellite, terrestrial_**
**_(fixed and wireless) networks, and associated value add service providers._**

The Group is subject to a number of risks relating to competition. The Group’s traditional competitors

are other satellite operators, including major international ones like Intelsat S.A., Eutelsat S.A. and Telesat
Holdings Inc. The Group also faces significant and increasing competition in different regions around the world
from national and regional satellite operators and vertically integrated service providers (such as ViaSat,
Inmarsat and Hughes Network Systems, a division of Echostar). In addition, the Group may face competition
from new market entrants providing satellite networks and solutions from Low Earth Orbit (such as SpaceX
Starlink, OneWeb, Amazon Kuiper and Telesat Lightspeed) and MEO in the future.

The development of national satellite programmes may hinder the Group’s ability to compete in those

countries on standard economic terms. The new capacity (which may be significant) may also negatively impact
the transponder supply/demand dynamics in those markets and result in lower transponder capacity pricing. The
implementation of national satellite systems may also increase the risk that market access for foreign satellite
operators will be restricted. In addition, some national operators enjoy advantages in their domestic markets,
such as tax and regulatory advantages or government funding, that are not available to SES. These or other
competitive advantages could result in a reduction in the Group’s business in such regions.

The Group’s business is vulnerable to increasing presence from non-traditional Video distributors such

as Netflix, Amazon and other online video (OTT) players. While relying on a distribution architecture that does
not include satellites, in many cases, these players compete directly with SES’s customers and increasingly drive
up the costs for premium sports and other content for them.

Developments and competition in the media market could result in a demand reduction for the Group’s

satellite services and/or pricing changes resulting in a significant negative impact on its revenues. Changing
consumer behaviour and the emergence of terrestrial technological substitution, particularly non-linear over the
top services, could lead to horizontal consolidation among satellite service providers and to a reduction in
demand for satellite-based distribution.

SES also faces competition from other forms of communications technology and services, such as

providers of mobile satellite communications solutions as well as terrestrial (fixed and wireless) networks,
including cable, fibre optic, digital subscriber line (DSL), radio relay broadcasting, very-high-frequency/ultrahigh-frequency transmission, worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), advanced Wi-Fi, 2G,
3G, 4G/long-term evolution (LTE) and 5G. Any increase in the technical and commercial effectiveness or
geographic spread of these competing service providers and technologies could result in a reduction in demand
for the Group’s satellite service offering and could make it more difficult for the Group to retain or develop its
customer portfolio. Some terrestrial (fixed and wireless) operators may receive state aid and subsidies not
available to SES, which could give them a competitive advantage over the Group.

The technological advancement of competitors to bolster cost efficiency and disruption of existing

business models by non-satellite players, and significant competition between satellite solution providers could
lead to oversupply, greater pressure on prices or a reduction in the demand for the Group’s services, which
could negatively impact its profits or revenue.


-----

**_Changes in technology or the satellite communications market could make the Group’s satellite_**
**_telecommunications system obsolete or subject to lower or reduced demand._**

Although, on the whole, the satellite communications market has been stable over the past years, in the

future the market may not grow as much as expected, may not grow at all or it may shrink. Technological
innovations that serve as alternatives to satellites could render satellite technology obsolete or less costcompetitive, and consumer viewing preferences may shift in a way that makes other technologies better suited to
delivering the broadcast content that currently accounts for most of the demand for the Group’s commercial
offering. The use of new technology to improve signal compression rates or changes in consumer preferences
(such as increased demand for new forms of video distribution, in particular non-linear or linear content
provision via broadband technologies by existing Pay TV providers or “over-the-top” by new entrants, or
increased consumption via devices not fed directly or indirectly via satellite), or future trends in viewing not yet
anticipated, could lead to a reduction in demand for the Group’s satellite capacity and associated services and
solutions. Existing technologies, such as fibre optic cable, are currently competing with satellite technology and
expanding their geographic reach and may experience innovations that make them more effective competition
for satellites. See “The telecommunications market is highly competitive and SES faces competition from
_satellite, terrestrial and wireless networks” above._

Similarly, demand for the current generation and future generations of high definition television

(HDTV) and ultra-high definition television (UHDTV) which the Group expects to be a major driver of demand
for satellite capacity in future periods, may fail to reach the levels the Group currently expects, which could lead
to lower than expected demand for the Group’s capacity.

If the Group cannot quickly and efficiently adapt to these changes, its satellites could become obsolete

or less competitive, leading to an inability to retain existing customers or attract new customers, a reduction in
demand for its services, and a negative impact on revenue.

Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and

results of operations.

**_SES is subject to risks from legal and arbitration proceedings._**

Disputes in relation to SES’s business arise from time to time and can result in legal or arbitration

proceedings. There can be no assurance that the Group will not become involved in legal or arbitration disputes
involving material claims for damages or other payments. The outcome of these and any other proceedings
cannot be predicted. In the event of a negative outcome in respect of any material legal or arbitration
proceeding, whether based on a judgment or a settlement agreement, SES could be required to make payments
that could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, the costs related to litigation and arbitration proceedings may be significant.

**Risks Relating to Regulation**

The telecommunications industry is highly regulated. As a result, SES is subject to a number of risks,

as described below. For more information on the regulation of the satellite industry and associated risks, see
“Regulation”.

**_If the Group or its customers fail to obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals, the Group may not_**
**_be able to operate its existing satellites or maintain or expand its operations._**

The Group must obtain and maintain approvals from authorities to operate or offer satellite capacity or

services. This often involves significant time and expense. For example, the Group must obtain authorisation or
market access (i.e., permission to offer services or capacity) in certain countries to permit the Group’s satellites
to transmit or receive signals to, from or within these countries. The failure to obtain or maintain the necessary
authorisations to operate satellites or to obtain the requisite market access or approvals to provide services in
certain countries could lead to loss of revenue. In addition, licensing authorities may revoke rights to use
frequencies at an orbital location if that orbital location is left vacant beyond the period permitted by such
regulator. If the Group cannot obtain, is delayed in obtaining or does not maintain in good standing, the required
regulatory approvals or loses authorisations as a result of changes to regulations or other government actions, it
may not be able to provide existing or future services to customers or expand to new customers or into new
services.


-----

In addition, customers are responsible for obtaining and maintaining certain regulatory approvals for

their operations. As a result, there may be governmental regulations of which SES is not aware or which may
adversely affect the operations of customers. The Group could lose revenue if customers fail to comply with
such approvals, if regulations are changed and customers are unable to satisfy the terms of any new regulations,
if necessary approvals are not granted on a timely basis or at all, in any jurisdictions in which customers wish to
operate or provide services or if applicable restrictions in those jurisdictions become unduly burdensome.

The occurrence of any of the risks above could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business,

financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group’s business is subject to extensive regulation and is sensitive to regulatory changes in each of the_**
**_countries in which it provides services._**

The operation of the Group’s business is and will continue to be subject (i) to the laws and regulations

of the governmental authorities of the countries where the Group operates, uses radio spectrum, offers satellite
services and/or capacity, and (ii) to the frequency coordination process of the International Telecommunication
Union (ITU). Regulation and legislation are extensive and outside the Group’s direct control. New or modified
rules, regulations, legislation or decisions by a relevant governmental, inter-governmental entity or the ITU
could materially and adversely affect operations.

In particular, the operations of the Group’s existing satellites are authorised by, among others, the

Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the United States, the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, Gibraltar, the
Bailiwick of Jersey (Jersey), Mexico, Canada, Sweden, Bermuda, the Andean Community and Brazil, and
therefore subject to the regulatory authority of those jurisdictions. Although SES believes that the Group is
substantially in compliance with regulatory requirements in these countries and the countries in which it
operates and offers satellite capacity and services, there can be no assurance that the Group will maintain the
authorisations necessary to operate its existing satellites or obtain required authorisations in the future, which
would affect future prospects.

In addition, the Group may in the future become subject to laws and regulations of which it is not

presently aware. If the Group fails to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, it could lose revenue from
services provided to the countries covered by those laws and regulations and subject the Group to criminal or
civil penalties.

Failure to obtain or maintain the required authorisations described above could have a material adverse

effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The ITU or national administrations may not allocate orbital slots and associated frequencies to permit the_**
**_Group to maintain or augment its satellite systems, or may restrict the Group’s access to frequencies on its_**
**_satellite systems._**

SES needs access to orbital slots and associated frequencies to permit it to maintain or grow its satellite

system and service offerings.

The ITU establishes radio regulations and is responsible for the allocation of spectrum for particular

uses, and the allocation to particular national administrations of orbital locations and/or spectrum. SES can only
access spectrum through ITU filings made by national administrations.

Orbital slots, satellite orbits and associated frequencies are a limited resource. The ITU and national

regulators may reallocate spectrum from satellite to terrestrial uses. National administrations are increasingly
charging for access to spectrum by way of fees and auctions. In addition, national administrations may revoke
SES’s rights to use spectrum, even when SES has an established business at a particular orbital location.

The most recent World Radiocommunication Conference in 2019 did not reallocate significant amounts

of spectrum from satellite to terrestrial uses. In addition, national administrations are studying the alleged
spectrum needs of terrestrial mobile and considering the reallocation or increased sharing of spectrum used by
satellites, which they can do independently of ITU radio regulations so long as they avoid international
interference.


-----

Any reallocation of spectrum from satellite to terrestrial uses or fees by national administrations may

have a significant adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group’s ability to use a satellite at a given orbital location or a satellite system in its orbit and assigned_**
**_frequencies for its proposed service or coverage area may be adversely affected by coordination issues._**

Like other satellite operators, SES is required to record, through relevant national administrations,

frequencies and orbital locations used by its satellites with the ITU and to coordinate the operation of its
satellites with the satellite networks filed with the ITU through other national administrations so as to prevent or
reduce harmful interference between its satellites and the satellites of other operators. It may not always be
possible to achieve successful coordination. This could affect the planned operation by SES of its satellites. In
certain cases, SES might also be required to coordinate any replacement satellite that has performance
characteristics which differ from those of the satellite that it replaces.

As a result of such coordination, SES may be required to modify the proposed satellite coverage areas

or satellite design or transmission plans in order to eliminate or minimise harmful interference with other
satellites or ground-based facilities. Those modifications may mean that use of a particular orbital position or
frequencies is restricted, possibly to the extent that it may not be economical to replace a satellite. In addition,
interference concerns of a country may affect the ability of the Group’s satellite network to generate revenue
due to the operational restrictions that the country may impose. Among others, such operational restrictions may
include not allowing transponders to be operated at the maximum power over the intended area, requiring
receiving or transmitting earth stations to use a minimum antenna size or using steerable coverage to avoid a
specific geographical area.

Similarly, if and to the extent that ITU regulations or other contractual or regulatory constraints fail to

prevent competing satellite operators from operating their satellites in a manner that causes harmful interference
with existing or future satellites operated by the Group, the performance of the Group’s satellites in the affected
areas could be adversely affected.

Coordination issues with other satellite operators arise from time to time, and the Group may not

always be able to resolve such issues quickly, or at all, which could lead to reputational harm, loss of customers,
deterioration of the Group’s relationships with other operators, degradation of signal quality resulting from
interference from satellites of other operators, operating or design restrictions that make the Group’s services in
a particular region less competitive or non-economic or limit the ability to fully utilise the capabilities of a
particular satellite or satellite system, and, to the extent an issue is not resolved in the Group’s favour, potential
loss of rights. Such issues also expose the Group to the risk of litigation.

In addition, certain of the Group’s frequency assignments are governed by specific national laws and

regulations. If any country decides to exercise its rights under these laws and regulations, or if these specific
regimes are amended, the Group could be forced to change or discontinue the use of its frequency assignments,
which could have a significant negative impact on its ability to operate its satellites.

Any of the factors above could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial

condition and results of operations.

**_If the Group does not occupy unused orbital locations or satellite orbits by specified deadlines, or does not_**
**_maintain satellites in the orbital locations the Group currently uses, those orbital locations or satellite orbits_**
**_may become available for use by other satellite companies._**

Orbital locations, satellite orbits or frequency bands that SES uses or is planning to use may become

available for other satellite operators to use if SES does not:

- occupy unused orbital locations or satellite orbits by specified deadlines;

- maintain satellites in their orbital locations or satellite orbits; and/or

- operate in all the frequency bands that have been filed at the ITU and for which a licence has been
received.


-----

SES has access to orbital locations and satellite orbits that have been filed at the ITU through various

national administrations. For each filing, the ITU and the national regulators impose conditions that must be met
in order to secure use of the spectrum and SES must determine, based on those conditions, which frequencies it
will bring into use and on what schedule. Operational issues like satellite launch failure, construction or launch
delay or in-orbit failure can compromise SES’s access to the spectrum at specific orbital locations and satellite
orbits. SES is committed to the highest quality in satellite procurement and launch, which helps to reduce this
risk. In addition, the Group’s large fleet may permit the relocation of in-orbit satellites in order to meet the
regulatory conditions. However, there is no guarantee that SES will always be able to prevent this risk and the
loss of an orbital location could have a material adverse effect on SES’s business, financial condition and results
of operations.

**_The Group is subject to export control laws including those of the United States which may preclude_**
**_exporting satellites for launch, satellite-related hardware, technology, data and services or preclude sourcing_**
**_these items in the United States._**

The Group must comply with applicable export control laws and regulations including applicable U.S.

export control laws in connection with any information, data, services, products or materials that it provides to,
or receives from, non-U.S. companies relating to communications satellites, launch vehicles and associated
equipment, customer equipment and data related to each. The Group’s U.S. operations may not be able to
maintain normal international business activities and the Group’s non-U.S. operations may not be able to source
or ship satellites, satellite related hardware, ground equipment software, data, technology and services in the
United States if:

- export licences or approvals cannot be, or are not, obtained or are obtained but later withdrawn due to
breach of or changes in policy;

- export licences or approvals are not timely obtained;

- export licences or approvals do not permit transfer of some or all items requested;

- launches are not permitted by particular suppliers or in the locations that SES prefers; or

- the requisite licence, when granted, contains conditions or restrictions that pose significant commercial
or technical issues.

Such occurrences could impede construction and delay the launch of any future satellites, negatively

impacting current or future revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group’s ability to provide services in certain countries may be restricted or prohibited due to sanctions_**
**_compliance laws and regulations._**

As an international company, SES’s business is subject to applicable financial and trade sanctions

compliance laws and regulations. Sanctions laws and regulations restrict SES’s ability to provide services or
export hardware or software in or to certain countries, persons or specific entities. In some cases, SES may be
able to obtain an authorisation from the relevant sanctioning country in order to provide service that would
otherwise be prohibited by sanctions; however, there is no guarantee that such authorisation will be granted. As
a result, SES may be required to forgo commercial opportunities that are subject to sanctions.

SES has policies and systems in place designed to monitor the company’s activities and to prevent

engaging in prohibited activities or dealing with sanctioned parties. Failure to obtain or maintain required
sanctions authorisations or failure to comply with applicable sanctions laws and regulations could have a
material adverse effect on the Group’s business.

**Risks Relating to Finance**

**_Each of SES and SES Americas is a holding entity._**


-----

SES and SES Americas are holding entities, and each of them conducts substantially all of its

operations through subsidiaries. As a result, the right to receive payments under the Securities and the
guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of SES’s subsidiaries other than SES Americas. The
ability of SES or SES Americas to meet their respective financial obligations is dependent upon the availability
of cash flows from their domestic and foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies through dividends,
intercompany advances, management fees and other payments.

The Securities are obligations of SES and are guaranteed exclusively by SES Americas. The other

subsidiaries of SES and SES Americas are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any
amounts due on the Securities or the guarantees or to provide SES or SES Americas with funds for its payment
obligations thereunder. As holding entities, the rights of SES and SES Americas to receive any assets of any of
their subsidiaries upon liquidation or reorganisation, and therefore the right of the holders of the Securities to
participate in those assets, will be structurally subordinated to those claims (including trade payables) of those
subsidiaries’ creditors. The Securities and the guarantees do not restrict the ability of those subsidiaries to incur
additional indebtedness or other liabilities. Even if SES or SES Americas were a creditor of any of its
subsidiaries, its rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of its subsidiaries
and any indebtedness of its subsidiaries might be senior to its rights as a creditor.

**_Failure to generate cash flow or access other capital resources could force the Group to reduce its operations_**
**_or default on debt service obligations._**

If, for any reason, SES is not successful in implementing its business model, cash flow and capital

resources may not be sufficient to repay indebtedness. If SES were unable to meet debt service obligations or
comply with covenants, a default under debt agreements would occur. To avoid a possible default or upon a
default, SES could be forced to reduce or delay the completion or expansion of the satellite fleet, sell assets,
obtain additional equity capital or restructure its debt. Any such action could have a material adverse effect on
the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Negative changes in SES’s debt rating may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial condition._**

A change in SES’s debt rating could affect the cost and terms of its debt as well as its ability to raise

funds. SES currently has a BBB- rating (stable outlook) with Standard & Poor’s and a Baa2 (negative outlook)
rating with Moody’s. As at the date of this Prospectus, the Guarantor has not been assigned a credit rating. SES
seeks to maintain investment grade credit ratings but there can be no guarantee that such ratings can be
maintained. The long-term issuer rating by Moody’s is granted on the basis of SES being designated as a
Government-Related Issuer (GRI), which provided for a one notch rating uplift to the Baseline Credit
Assessment (BCA). A reduction in the collective economic ownership stake in SES held by the Grand Duchy of
Luxembourg, both directly and indirectly, could result in the loss of GRI status and related credit rating uplift.
There can be no guarantee that the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg will maintain, directly or indirectly, its current
level of economic ownership interest in SES (see also “Principal Shareholders”).

Among other things, an increase in financial leverage ratios beyond the thresholds recommended by the

rating agencies could result in a downgrade. If SES’s credit rating were to be downgraded, it would affect SES’s
ability to obtain financing and the terms associated with that financing. Furthermore, a downgrade of SES’s
corporate family rating to non-investment grade by Moody’s would likely result in the loss of the 50 per cent.
equity credit (“Basket C”) attributed by Moody’s to the two series of Deeply Subordinated Fixed Rate Securities
(with a total principal amount of €1.3 billion), which would adversely impact SES’s credit metrics in Moody's
overall credit assessment. SES cannot guarantee that it will be able to maintain its credit ratings.

S&P and Moody’s are established in the European Union and are registered under the CRA Regulation.

S&P and Moody’s also appear on the latest available update (as of 7 May 2021) of the European Securities and
Markets Authority’s list of credit rating agencies currently available on its website

(https://www.esma.europa.eu/supervision/credit-rating-agencies/risk).

**_The Group’s financial results may be materially adversely affected by unforeseen additional tax assessments_**
**_or other tax liabilities._**

SES does business in many different countries and is subject to tax liabilities on its business operations

in multiple tax jurisdictions. SES makes provisions in its accounts for current and deferred tax liabilities and tax
assets based on a continuous assessment of tax laws relating to it.


-----

However, SES cannot be certain of a tax authority’s application and interpretation of the tax law. SES

may be subjected by tax authorities to unforeseen material tax claims including late payment interest and/or
penalties. These unforeseen tax claims may arise through a large number of reasons including identification of a
taxable presence of a non-indigenous group company in a taxing jurisdiction, transfer pricing adjustments,
application of indirect taxes on certain business transactions after the event and disallowance of the benefits of a
tax treaty. In addition, SES may be subject to tax law changes in a taxing jurisdiction, which could lead to
retroactive tax claims.

Although SES has implemented a tax risks mitigation charter based (among other things) on a

framework of tax opinions for the financially material tax positions taken by SES, transfer pricing
documentation for the important intra-Group transactions of SES and a transfer pricing policy and procedures
for accurate tax compliance in all taxing jurisdictions, there is no guarantee that the charter will be effective. If
the Group becomes subject to a significant amount of unanticipated tax liabilities or has its transfer pricing
arrangements successfully challenged, it could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s effective tax rate,
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group is exposed to liquidity, currency and foreign exchange, interest rate and counterparty risks._**

**_The Group is exposed to risks in relation to liquidity, foreign currency, interest rates, credit risk on financial_**
**_assets, financial credit from counterparties and capital management. For further details, see note 18 to the_**
**_consolidated financial statements for SES for the year ended 31 December 2020, which are incorporated by_**
**_reference in this Prospectus._**

**_Failure to adequately manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s_**

**_business, financial condition and results of operations._**

**_The Group is exposed to risks associated with macroeconomic conditions in the global economy, both in_**
**_developing markets and developed markets._**

An economic slowdown in the countries where the Group operates may have a negative effect on the

Group’s performance if potential customers face difficulties funding their business plans, which could in turn
delay the onset of new revenue. This situation could be further affected by measures concerning the currencies
adopted in the countries where the Group operates, as well as by political instability and governments’ inability
to take timely action to deal with the crisis. Most recently, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has
dampened economic activity and eroded financial conditions worldwide. Governments and public bodies in
affected countries have introduced and continue to introduce emergency public measures such as travel bans,
quarantines, and public lockdowns.

Whilst the full impact of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis remains impossible to predict with a high

degree of certainty, as at the date of this Prospectus, overall, COVID-19 is having a significant impact on the
worldwide economy and, as a result, a pronounced short and medium-term impact on the Group, significantly
challenging the contract base, renewals and dampening growth across the Group’s Mobility, Energy and
Government segments, as well as stretching cash flows across much of the industry, and accelerating a
restructuring / consolidation process in some parts of the sectors the Group serves. To the extent the worldwide
economy continues to be impacted and does not rebound quickly, then there could continue to be an impact on
the demand for the Group’s products and services, as its customers (who are based around the world) may
themselves be adversely impacted by COVID-19 and so reduce their spending – see further “Business - Recent
_Developments – COVID-19” below and note 32 to the consolidated financial statements for SES for the year_
ended 31 December 2020, which are incorporated by reference in this Prospectus.


-----

**_The Group is exposed to asset impairment risk._**

**_SES’s non-current intangible and tangible assets are valued at historic cost less amortisation,_**

**_depreciation (where relevant) and accumulated impairment charges. The resulting net book values are_**
**_subject to validation each year through impairment testing procedures, where they are compared to the_**
**_higher of fair value or value-in-use of the asset, representing the present value of the future cash flows_**
**_expected to be derived from the asset. Where future assumptions for a specific asset, as set out in the_**
**_approved business plan, become less favourable, or the discount rates applied to the future cash flows_**
**_increase, then this may result in the need for material asset impairment charges._**

In the SES S.A. annual accounts, impairment testing – using value-in-use procedures similar to those

outlined above – is performed on the carrying value of the shares in affiliate undertakings, or on the carrying
value of groups of shareholdings where the Board of Directors believes that it is more appropriate under the
circumstances, and better reflects the substance of the activities, the interdependency of the associated cash
flows and their level of integration. If the carrying value of the relevant investment, or group of investments, is
not substantiated by its value-in-use, and any shortfall is assessed as being of an other than temporary nature,
then this could result in an impairment charge being recorded to the income statement of the SES S.A. annual
accounts in the period concerned.

**Risks related to the Securities generally**

**_The Securities will be perpetual securities._**

The Securities will be perpetual securities in respect of which there is no fixed redemption date by which the
Issuer would be under the obligation to redeem the Securities. See “Terms and Conditions of the Securities—
_Redemption”. Therefore, prospective investors should be aware that they may be required to bear financial risks_
of an investment in the Securities for an indefinite period of time and may not recover their investment in the
foreseeable future.

**_The Securities will be subject to optional redemption by the Issuer including upon the occurrence of certain_**
**_events._**

The Securities will be redeemable, at the option of the Issuer, in whole but not in part, on any date during the
period commencing on (and including) 27 May 2026 to (and including) the First Reset Date or on any Call Date
thereafter at their principal amount together with any accrued and unpaid interest up to (but excluding) the
redemption date and any outstanding Arrears of Interest. In addition, the Issuer may redeem the Securities, in
whole but not in part, on any date prior to 27 May 2026 at the Make-whole Redemption Amount as described in
Condition 9(c) (Redemption of the Issuer (Make-whole)).

In addition, upon the occurrence of an Accounting Event, a Capital Event, a Change of Control Event, a Tax
Deduction Event, a Substantial Repurchase Event or a Withholding Tax Event (each as defined in the Conditions
and as more fully described in Condition 9 of the Securities), the Issuer shall have the option to redeem, in
whole but not in part, the Securities at the prices set out therein, in each case together with any accrued and
unpaid interest up to (but excluding) the redemption date and any outstanding Arrears of Interest. In the case of
a Change of Control Event, in the event that the Issuer does not elect to redeem the Securities, the then
prevailing Interest Rate (as defined in the Conditions), and each subsequent Interest Rate otherwise determined
in accordance with Condition 7 of the Securities, on the Securities shall be increased by 5 per cent. per annum
with effect from (and including) the date on which the Change of Control Event occurred.

During any period when the Issuer may, or may be perceived to be able to, elect to redeem the Securities, the
market value of the Securities generally will not rise substantially above the price at which they can be
redeemed. This also may be true prior to any redemption period.

The Issuer may be expected to redeem the Securities when its cost of borrowing is lower than the interest
payable on the Securities. At those times, an investor generally would not be able to reinvest the redemption
proceeds at an effective interest rate as high as the interest payable on the Securities being redeemed and may
only be able to do so at a significantly lower rate. Potential investors should consider reinvestment risk in light
of other investments available at that time.

There is no redemption at the option of holders of the Securities.


-----

**_The interest rate on the Securities will reset on the First Reset Date and on every Reset Date thereafter, which_**
**_can be expected to affect the interest payable on the Securities and the market value of the Securities._**

Although the Securities will earn interest at a fixed rate until (but excluding) the First Reset Date, the current
market interest rate on the capital markets (the market interest rate) typically changes on a daily basis. Since the
initial fixed rate of interest for the Securities will be reset on the First Reset Date (as set out in the Conditions),
and on each subsequent Reset Date, the interest payable on the Securities will also change. If the market interest
rate increases, the price of such security typically falls, until the yield of such security is approximately equal to
the market interest rate. If the market interest rate falls, the price of a fixed interest rate security typically
increases, until the yield of such security is approximately equal to the market interest rate. Holders of the
Securities (the Holders) should be aware that movements in these market interest rates can adversely affect the
price of the Securities and can lead to losses for the Holders if they sell the Securities.

Holders are exposed to the risk of fluctuating interest rate levels and uncertain interest income as the reset rates
could affect the market value of an investment in the Securities.

**_The Holders of the Securities are exposed to risks relating to the reset of interest rates linked to the 5 year_**
**_Swap Rate._**

From and including the First Reset Date of the Securities to the date on which the Issuer redeems the Securities
in whole pursuant to the Conditions, the Securities bear interest at a rate which will be determined on each Reset
Interest Determination Date at the 5 year Swap Rate for the relevant Reset Period plus the relevant Margin for
the relevant Reset Period. Potential investors should be aware that the performance of the 5 year Swap Rate and
the interest income on the Securities cannot be anticipated. Due to varying interest income, potential investors
are not able to determine a definite yield of the Securities at the time they purchase them, therefore their return
on investment cannot be compared with that of investments having longer fixed interest periods. In addition,
after Interest Payment Dates, Holders are exposed to the reinvestment risk if market interest rates decline. That
is, Holders may reinvest the interest income paid to them only at the relevant lower interest rates then
prevailing.

Potential investors in the Securities should bear in mind that neither the current nor the historical level of the 5
year Swap Rate is an indication of the future development of such 5 year Swap Rate during the term of the
Securities.

Furthermore, during each Reset Period, it cannot be ruled out that the price of the Securities may fall as a result
of changes in the market interest rate, as the market interest rate fluctuates. During each of these periods, the
Holders are exposed to the risks as described under "– The interest rate on the Securities will reset on the First
_Reset Date and on every Reset Date thereafter, which can be expected to affect the interest payable on the_
_Securities and the market value of the Securities."._

**_Future discontinuance of EURIBOR or the occurrence of a Benchmark Event may adversely affect the value_**
**_of the Securities_**

_Future discontinuance of EURIBOR and benchmark reforms_

EURIBOR and any other interest rate or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be "benchmarks"
are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory discussions and proposals for reform. Regulation
(EU) 2016/1011 on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure
the performance of investment funds (the BMR), published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 29
June 2016 and applicable from 1 January 2018, could have a material impact on the Securities linked to
EURIBOR, in particular, if the methodology or other terms of the “benchmark” are changed in order to comply
with the terms of the BMR, and such changes could (amongst other things) have the effect of reducing or
increasing the rate or level, or affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the benchmark.

The 5-year Swap Rate and the 6-month EURIBOR rate (on which the floating leg of the 5 year Swap Rate is
based) constitute benchmarks for the purposes of the BMR.

Following the implementation of any potential reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may
change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or the benchmark could be eliminated
entirely, or there could be other consequences that cannot be predicted. The elimination of the EURIBOR


-----

benchmark, or changes in the manner of its administration, could require or result in an adjustment to the
interest calculation provisions of the Conditions, or result in adverse consequences to holders of the relevant
Securities. Furthermore, even prior to the implementation of any changes, uncertainty as to the nature of
alternative reference rates and as to potential changes to such benchmark may adversely affect such benchmark
during the term of the relevant Securities, the return on the relevant Securities and the trading market for
securities (including the relevant Securities) based on the same benchmark. Such changes could, among other
things, have the effect of reducing, increasing or otherwise affecting the volatility of the published rate or level
of the 5 year Swap Rate.

_Potential for a fixed rate return_

Investors should be aware that, if EURIBOR were discontinued or otherwise unavailable, the rate of interest on
the Securities for the period from (and including) the relevant Reset Date, which is based on the 5 year Swap
Rate, may be affected. If such rate is not available, the rate of interest on the Securities will be determined by the
fall-back provisions applicable to the Securities. This may in certain circumstances result in the effective
application of a fixed rate based on the rate which was last observed on the relevant Screen Page.

_Benchmark Events_

The Conditions also provide for certain fall-back arrangements in the event that the Issuer determines that a
Benchmark Event has occurred. If a Benchmark Event occurs, the Issuer shall use its reasonable endeavours to
appoint an Independent Adviser. The Independent Adviser shall endeavour to determine a Successor Rate or,
failing which, an Alternative Reference Rate to be used in place of the relevant Original Reference Rate. The use
of any such Successor Rate or Alternative Reference Rate to determine the relevant Subsequent Fixed Interest
Rate may result in the Securities performing differently (including paying a lower Subsequent Fixed Interest
Rate than they would do if the relevant Original Reference Rate were to continue to apply in its current form).

Furthermore, if a Successor Rate or Alternative Reference Rate is determined by the Independent Adviser, the
Conditions provide that the Issuer may vary the Conditions and the Fiscal Agency Agreement, as necessary, to
ensure the proper operation of such Successor Rate or Alternative Reference Rate, without any requirement for
consent or approval of the relevant Holders.

If a Successor Rate or Alternative Reference Rate is determined by the Independent Adviser, the Conditions also
provide that an Adjustment Spread will be determined by the Independent Adviser to be applied to such
Successor Rate or Alternative Reference Rate.

The Adjustment Spread is (i) the spread, formula or methodology which is formally recommended in relation to
the replacement of the Original Reference Rate with the Successor Rate by any Relevant Nominating Body
(which may include a relevant central bank, supervisory authority or group of central banks/supervisory
authorities), (ii) if no such recommendation has been made, or in the case of an Alternative Rate, the spread,
formula or methodology which the Independent Adviser determines is customarily applied to the relevant
Successor Rate or the Alternative Rate (as the case may be) in international debt capital markets transactions to
produce an industry-accepted replacement rate for the Original Reference Rate, or (iii) if the Independent
Adviser determines that no such spread is customarily applied, the spread, formula or methodology which the
Independent Adviser determines and which is recognised or acknowledged as being the industry standard for
over-the-counter derivative transactions which reference the Original Reference Rate, where such rate has been
replaced by the Successor Rate or the Alternative Rate, as the case may be.

Accordingly, the application of an Adjustment Spread may result in the Securities performing differently (which
may include payment of a lower rate of interest) than they would do if the Original Reference Rate were to
continue to apply in its current form.

The Issuer may be unable to appoint an Independent Adviser or the Independent Adviser may not be able to
determine a Successor Rate or Alternative Rate or relevant Adjustment Spread in accordance with the
Conditions.

Where the Issuer is unable to appoint an Independent Adviser, or the Independent Adviser is unable, to
determine a Successor Rate or Alternative Rate, in each case prior to the date which is 10 business days prior to
the relevant Reset Interest Determination Date, or if a Successor Rate or Alternative Rate is not adopted
because, in the determination of the Issuer, the same could reasonably be expected to cause a Capital Event to


-----

occur, the Subsequent Fixed Interest Rate will be equal to the annualised mid-swap rate with a term of five years
last appearing on the Reset Screen Page as determined by the Agent Bank. This will result in the effective
application of a fixed rate based on the rate which was last observed on the Reset Screen Page.

Applying the 5 year Swap Rate last appearing on the Reset Screen Page as determined by the Agent Bank is
likely to result in Securities linked to or referencing the relevant benchmark performing differently (which may
include payment of a lower Rate of Interest) than they would do if the relevant benchmark were to continue to
apply, or if a Successor Rate or Alternative Rate could be determined.

Any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on the value or liquidity of, and return on, the relevant
Securities. Due to the uncertainty concerning the availability of Successor Rates and Alternative Rates, the
involvement of an Independent Adviser, the potential for further regulatory developments, there is a risk that the
relevant fallback provisions may not operate as intended at the relevant time. Moreover, any of the above
matters or any other significant change to the setting or existence of the Original Reference Rate could adversely
affect the ability of the Issuer to meet its obligations under the Securities and could have a material adverse
effect on the value or liquidity of, and the amount payable under, the Securities.

**_The Issuer has the right to defer interest payments on the Securities._**

The Issuer may, at its discretion, elect to defer all or part of any payment of interest on the Securities which is
otherwise scheduled to be paid on an Interest Payment Date. See “Terms and Conditions of the Securities—
_Optional Interest Deferral”. Only upon the occurrence of a Compulsory Arrears of Interest Settlement Event, in_
the event of a redemption of the Securities pursuant to Condition 9 or in the event of a winding up of the Issuer
or the Guarantor in a manner falling within Condition 14 will the Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be, be
obliged to pay any such Arrears of Interest to Holders.

Any such deferral of interest payment shall not constitute an Enforcement Event or a default for any purpose
unless such payment is required in accordance with Condition 8(b) of the Securities. Although the Issuer intends
to pay all outstanding Arrears of Interest (if any) in respect of the Securities on the fifth anniversary of the
Interest Payment Date on which the Deferred Interest Payment first arose, this is only a current intention, not an
obligation of the Issuer. Therefore, there can be no assurance that deferred interest will be satisfied within such
five year period.

Any deferral of interest payments or any perceived increase in the likelihood thereof is likely to have an adverse
effect on the market price of the Securities. In addition, as a result of the interest deferral provision of the
Securities, the market price of the Securities may be more volatile than the market prices of other debt securities
on which original issue discount or interest accrues that are not subject to such deferrals and may be more
sensitive generally to adverse changes in the Issuer’s financial condition.

**_Integral multiples of less than the specified denomination._**

The denominations of the Securities are €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Therefore,
it is possible that the Securities may be traded in amounts in excess of €100,000 that are not integral multiples of
€100,000. In such a case, a Holder who, as a result of trading such amounts, holds a principal amount of less
than €100,000 in its account with the relevant clearing system, will not receive a Certificate in respect of such
holding (should Certificates be printed) and would need to purchase a principal amount of Securities such that it
holds an amount equal to one or more denominations. If Certificates are issued, Holders should be aware that
Certificates representing Securities which have a denomination that is not an integral multiple of €100,000 may
be illiquid and difficult to trade.

**_The Issuer’s obligations under the Securities and the Guarantor’s obligations under the Guarantee will be, in_**
**_each case, subordinated._**

The Issuer’s obligations under the Securities and the Guarantor’s obligations under the Guarantee will be, in
each case, unsecured and subordinated. In the event of:

(a) an order being made, or an effective resolution being passed, for the winding-up of the Issuer or, as
the case may be, the Guarantor (except, in any such case, a solvent winding-up solely for the
purposes of a reorganisation, restructuring, reconstruction, merger, conversion or amalgamation of
the Issuer or, as the case may be, the Guarantor or the substitution in place of the Issuer of a New


-----

Issuer in accordance with Condition 18 or, in the case of the Guarantor, substitution or termination
in accordance with Condition 19, the terms of which reorganisation, restructuring, reconstruction,
merger, conversion, amalgamation or substitution or termination (x) are authorised or permitted in
accordance with the provisions of the Conditions or have previously been approved by an
Extraordinary Resolution (as defined in the Fiscal Agency Agreement) and (y) do not provide that
the Securities shall thereby become redeemable or repayable in accordance with the Conditions);

(b) an administrator or receiver of the Issuer or, as the case may be, the Guarantor being appointed and
such administrator or receiver giving notice that it intends to declare and distribute a dividend or
distribution (in the case of the Guarantor, such distribution being in respect of the partnership
interests of the Guarantor or, after a substitution pursuant to Condition 19, any other ownership
interests); or

(c) any analogous event relating to the Issuer or, as the case may be, the Guarantor to those described in
(a) and (b) above under any insolvency, bankruptcy or similar law applicable to the Issuer or, as the
case may be, the Guarantor,

the claims of the Holders will rank (i) junior to the claims of holders of all Senior Obligations of the Issuer or
the Guarantor, as the case may be, (ii) _pari passu with the claims of holders of all Parity Obligations of the_
Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be, and (iii) senior to the claims of, in the case of the Issuer, holders of
any class of share capital of the Issuer and any other obligations of the Issuer, issued directly or indirectly by it,
which rank, or are expressed to rank, _pari passu with any such class of share capital, or, in the case of the_
Guarantor, holders of any class of partnership interest (whether common or preferred) of the Guarantor and any
other obligations of the Guarantor, issued directly or indirectly by it, which rank, or are expressed to rank, _pari_
_passu with any such class of partnership interest. See “Terms and Conditions of the Securities—Status”, “Terms_
_and Conditions of the Securities—Subordination”, “Terms and Conditions of the Securities—Status of the_
_Guarantee” and “Terms and Conditions of the Securities—Subordination of the Guarantee”._

By virtue of such subordination, payments to a Holder will, in the events described in the Conditions, only be
made after all obligations of the Issuer or, as the case may be, the Guarantor resulting from higher ranking
claims have been satisfied. A Holder may, therefore, recover less than the holders of unsubordinated or other
prior ranking subordinated liabilities of the Issuer or, as the case may be, the Guarantor. Furthermore, the
Conditions will not limit the amount of the liabilities ranking senior to, or pari passu with, the Securities or the
Guarantee which may be incurred or assumed by the Issuer or the Guarantor respectively from time to time,
whether before or after the Issue Date. The incurrence of any such other liabilities may reduce the amount (if
any) recoverable by Holders on a winding-up or administration of the Issuer or, as the case may be, the
Guarantor and/or may increase the likelihood of a deferral of interest payments under the Securities. Subject to
applicable law, no Holder may exercise, claim or plead any right of set-off, compensation or retention in respect
of any amount owed to it by the Issuer in respect of, or arising under or in connection with, the Securities or any
amount owed to it by the Guarantor in respect of, or arising under or in connection with, the Guarantee, and
each Holder shall, by virtue of his holding of any Security, be deemed to have waived all such rights of set-off,
compensation or retention.

Although subordinated debt securities, such as the Securities, may pay a higher rate of interest than comparable
debt securities which are not subordinated, there is a real risk that an investor in subordinated securities such as
the Securities will lose all or some of his investment should the Issuer become insolvent.

**_The Guarantor may be replaced by another entity in the Group or the Guarantee may be terminated._**

The Deed of Guarantee contains provisions which (i) allow the Guarantor at any time to substitute itself for
another entity in the Group or a successor in business of the Guarantor; and (ii) for so long as SES Global
Americas Holdings GP remains Guarantor, permit a termination of the Guarantee where (A) an order is made by
any competent court or effective resolution passed for the winding up or dissolution of SES Global Americas
Holdings GP and such winding up or dissolution is for the purposes of or pursuant to an amalgamation,
reorganisation or restructuring while solvent and pursuant to which SES S.A. assumes all of the assets, liabilities
and obligations of SES Global Americas Holdings GP (and any such termination becoming effective upon the
relevant winding up or dissolution taking effect) or (B) (I) Total Assets of the Guarantor represented less than 10
per cent. of the Total Assets of Issuer; and (II) the EBITDA of the Guarantor represented less than 10 per cent.
of the Total Assets of Issuer, in each case as of the end of the previous two Fiscal Periods prior to the date of
such termination. The Guarantor may only elect to effect any such substitution or termination if (i) no


-----

Enforcement Event has occurred and is continuing, (ii) each Rating Agency confirms that upon such substitution
or termination becoming effective the Securities will either have the same credit rating as immediately prior to
such substitution or termination or the credit rating will not be adversely affected, (iii) each Rating Agency
confirms that upon such substitution or termination becoming effective the Securities will either still be eligible
for the same, or a higher amount of, “equity credit” (or such other nomenclature that the Rating Agency may
then use to describe the degree to which an instrument exhibits the characteristics of an ordinary share) as is
attributed to the Securities on the date immediately prior to such substitution or termination or such eligibility or
attribution will not be adversely affected, (iv) in the case of a termination of the Guarantee only, two Authorised
Signatories of the Issuer shall have certified to the Fiscal Agent that the requirements of Condition 19 have been
fulfilled prior to such termination taking effect and (v) two Authorised Signatories of the Issuer or two
Authorised Signatories of the Guarantor certify to the Fiscal Agent that, following consultation with an
independent investment bank of international repute, an independent financial adviser with appropriate expertise
or independent counsel of recognised standing, the Issuer or, as the case may be, the Guarantor has concluded
that such substitution or termination (a) will not result in the Issuer having an entitlement, as at the date such
substitution or termination becomes effective, to redeem the Securities as a result of a Special Event and (b) in
the case of a substitution only, will not result in the terms of the Securities and the Guarantee (taken together)
immediately following such substitution being materially less favourable to holders than the terms of the
Securities and the Guarantee (taken together) immediately prior to such substitution. However, notwithstanding
each of the conditions being satisfied prior to any such substitution or termination, there can be no guarantee
that any such substitution or termination will not have an adverse effect on the price of the Securities and
subsequently lead to losses for the Holders if they sell the Securities.

**_The current IFRS accounting classification of financial instruments such as the Securities as equity_**
**_instruments may change, which may result in the occurrence of an Accounting Event._**

In June 2018, the IASB (International Accounting Standards Board) published the discussion paper DP/2018/1
on "Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Equity" (the “DP/2018/1 Paper”) and public meetings were
held on 23 October 2019, 16 December 2020 and 16 February 2021 to discuss the proposals contained therein.
During the 16 December 2020 meeting, the IASB decided to add the “Financial Instruments with
_Characteristics of Equity” project to its standard-setting programme and to continue using the expertise of_
advisory bodies instead of establishing a dedicated consultative group for the project. During the 16 February
2021 meeting, (i) the IASB discussed potential refinements to disclosure proposals explored in the DP/2018/1
Paper – namely, proposals for information about priority on liquidation, potential dilution, and terms and
conditions, but was not asked to make any decisions but directed the staff to further consider the objectives of
the proposed disclosures and their scope and (ii) the IASB also discussed challenges in accounting for financial
instruments with obligations that arise only on liquidation of an entity and also discussed potential classification,
presentation and disclosure requirements to address those challenges and tentatively decided not to change how
such instruments should be classified; but instead to develop presentation and disclosure requirements in
relation to them. If the proposals set out in the DP/2018/1 Paper are implemented in their current form, the
current IFRS accounting classification of financial instruments such as the Securities as equity instruments may
change and this may result in the occurrence of an “Accounting Event” (as described in the Conditions). In such
an event, the Issuer may have the option to redeem, in whole but not in part, the Securities pursuant to the
Conditions.

The implementation of any of the proposals set out in the DP/2018/1 Paper or any other similar such proposals
that may be made in the future, including the extent and timing of any such implementation, if at all, is still
uncertain. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the future classification of the Securities from an
accounting perspective or whether any such change may result in the occurrence of an Accounting Event,
thereby providing the Issuer with the option to redeem the Securities pursuant to the Conditions. The occurrence
of an Accounting Event may result in Holders receiving a lower than expected yield. The period during which
the Issuer may notify the redemption of the Securities as a result of the occurrence of an Accounting Event shall
start on and include the Accounting Event Adoption Date, which is the earlier of such date that a change is
officially announced in respect of IFRS or officially adopted or put into practice.

The redemption of the Securities by the Issuer or the perception that the Issuer will exercise its optional
redemption right might negatively affect the market value of the Securities. During any period when the Issuer
may elect to redeem the Securities, the market value of the Securities generally will not rise substantially above
the price at which they can be redeemed.


-----

**_No limitation on issuing senior or pari passu securities_**

There is no restriction on the amount of securities or other liabilities which the Issuer or the Guarantor may
issue, guarantee or incur and which rank senior to, or pari passu with, the Securities or the Guarantee. The issue
of any such securities or the incurrence of any such other liabilities may reduce the amount (if any) recoverable
by Holders on a winding-up of the Issuer or the Guarantor (as the case may be) and/or may increase the
likelihood of a deferral of interest payments under the Securities.

If the Issuer’s and/or the Guarantor’s financial condition were to deteriorate, the Holders could suffer direct and
materially adverse consequences, including loss of interest and, if the Issuer and/or the Guarantor were
liquidated (whether voluntarily or not), the Holders could suffer loss of their entire investment.

**_Limited Remedies._**

The Conditions will provide that the Securities will be perpetual securities and there is, therefore, no obligation
on the Issuer to repay principal on any given date. In addition, payments of interest on the Securities may be
deferred in accordance with Condition 8(a) of the Securities and interest will not therefore be due other than in
the limited circumstances described in Condition 8(b) of the Securities.

The only enforcement event in the Conditions is if a default is made by the Issuer and the Guarantor for a period
of 14 days or more in the payment of principal or 21 days or more in the payment of interest, in each case in
respect of the Securities and which is due. Upon such a payment default, the sole remedy available to Holders
for the recovery of amounts owing in respect of any payment of principal or interest on the Securities will be the
institution of proceedings to enforce such payment.

Therefore, it will only be possible for the Holders to enforce claims for payment of principal or interest in
respect of the Securities when the same are due.

In addition the claims of holders of all Senior Obligations will first have to be satisfied in any winding-up or
administration proceedings before the Holders may expect to obtain any recovery in respect of their Securities
or, as the case may be, under the Guarantee, and prior thereto Holders will have only limited ability to influence
the conduct of such winding-up or administration proceedings. See “ _– The Issuer’s obligations under the_
_Securities and the Guarantor’s obligations under the Guarantee will be, in each case, subordinated”._

**_Modification, Waiver and Substitution._**

The Conditions will contain provisions for calling meetings of Holders to consider matters affecting their
interests generally. These provisions will permit defined majorities of holders of the Securities to bind all
Holders, including those Holders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meetings and Holders who voted in
a manner contrary to the majority.

The Conditions and the Fiscal Agency Agreement will also provide that the Fiscal Agent and the Issuer may
agree, without the consent of Holders, to (i) any modification (except such modifications in respect of which an
increased quorum is required in accordance with the provisions of the Fiscal Agency Agreement) of the Fiscal
Agency Agreement which is not prejudicial to the interests of the Holders or (ii) any modification of the
Securities or the Fiscal Agency Agreement which is of a formal, minor or technical nature or is made to correct a
manifest or proven error or to comply with mandatory provisions of the law or (iii) effect any Benchmark
Amendments (see further “Future discontinuance of EURIBOR or the occurrence of a Benchmark Event may
_adversely affect the value of the Securities–Benchmark Events”)._

The Issuer may also at any time, without the consent of the Holders, substitute for itself as the principal debtor
under the Securities, the Guarantor or any other member of the Group upon the fulfilment of certain
preconditions set out under Condition 18. Notwithstanding each of the preconditions being satisfied prior to any
such substitution, there can be no guarantee that any such substitution will not have an adverse effect on the
price of the Securities and subsequently lead to losses for the Holders if they sell the Securities.

**_Variation or substitution of the Securities without Holder consent._**

Subject as provided in Condition 10 and Condition 11, the Issuer may, in its sole discretion and without the
consent or approval of the Holders, elect to substitute the Securities for, or vary the terms of the Securities with


-----

the effect that they become or remain, Qualifying Securities at any time following the occurrence of an
Accounting Event, a Capital Event, a Tax Deduction Event or a Withholding Tax Event. Whilst Qualifying
Securities are required to have terms which are not materially less favourable to Holders (as a class) than the
terms of the Securities and the Guarantee taken together, there can be no assurance that the Qualifying Securities
will not have a significant adverse impact on the price of, and /or market for, the Securities or the circumstances
of individual Holders.

Further, prior to the making of any such modification or taking any action as aforementioned in this risk factor
or in the risk factor “Modification, Waiver and Substitution” above, or prior to any substitution, termination or
variation in a manner contemplated in Conditions 10, 18 or 19, the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Fiscal Agent
shall not be obliged to have regard to the tax position of individual holders of the Securities or to the tax
consequences of any such modification, substitution, termination, variation or other action for individual holders
of the Securities. No holder of Securities shall be entitled to claim, whether from the Fiscal Agent, the Issuer, the
Guarantor, a New Issuer or any other person, any indemnification or payment in respect of any tax consequence
of any such modification, substitution, termination, variation or other action upon individual holders of the
Securities.

**_Change of law._**

The Securities will be governed by English law and, in respect of Conditions 3(a) and 6(a) of the Securities only,
Luxembourg law and Delaware law respectively. No assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible
judicial decision or change to English law, Luxembourg law or Delaware law or any administrative practice
thereof after the Issue Date.

**_The Global Certificate is held by or on behalf of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg and investors will_**
**_have to rely on their procedures for transfer, payment and communication with the Issuer._**

The Global Certificate will be registered in the name of a nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg
(the Relevant Nominee). Except in the circumstances described in the Global Certificate, investors will not be
entitled to receive Certificates. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg will maintain records of the interests in
the Global Certificate. While the Securities are represented by the Global Certificate, investors will be able to
trade their interests only through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg.

While Securities are represented by the Global Certificate, the Issuer will discharge its payment obligations
under such Securities by making payments to (or for the order of) the Relevant Nominee for distribution to their
account holders. A holder of an interest in a Global Certificate must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, Luxembourg to receive payments under the Securities. The Issuer has no responsibility or liability
for the records relating to, or payments made in respect of, interests in the Global Certificate.

Holders of interests in the Global Certificate will not have a direct right to vote in respect of the Securities.
Instead, Holders will be permitted to act only to the extent that they are enabled to do so by Euroclear or
Clearstream, Luxembourg.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks_**

The Securities are expected to be assigned a rating of Ba1 by Moody's and BB by S&P. The ratings may not
reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional factors and other factors that
may affect the value of the Securities. A credit rating is not a statement as to the likelihood of deferral of interest
on the Securities. Holders have a greater risk of deferral of interest payments than persons holding other
securities with similar credit ratings but no, or more limited, interest deferral provisions.

In addition, each of S&P and Moody’s, or any other rating agency may change its methodologies for rating
securities with features similar to the Securities in the future. This may include the relationship between ratings
assigned to an issuer’s senior securities and ratings assigned to securities with features similar to the Securities
sometimes called “notching”. If the rating agencies were to change their practices for rating such securities in
the future and the ratings of the Securities were to be subsequently lowered, this may have a negative impact on
the trading price of the Securities.


-----

**_Provisions which provide for interest to be payable on interest may be unenforceable as a matter of_**
**_Luxembourg law._**

The Securities contain provisions which provide that any Deferred Interest Payment (as defined in the
Conditions) (or part thereof) shall itself bear interest. If it came to any proceeding before a Luxembourg court
any provision relating to the payment of interest on interest may not be enforceable pursuant to Article 1154 of
the Luxembourg Civil Code. There exists no published case law in Luxembourg in relation to the recognition of
provisions pursuant to which a party agrees to pay to the other party an interest on interest. If a Luxembourg
court had to analyse the validity and enforceability of such provisions, it may likely consider the position taken
by the French _Cour de Cassation and Belgian, French and Luxembourg legal scholars according to which_
Article 1154 of the Civil Code is not of international public policy and, therefore, provisions relating to the
payment of interest on interest provided for in a foreign law document, such as the Conditions, are not affected
by Article 1154 of the Civil Code. There can, however, be no guarantee that a Luxembourg court would take this
approach.

**Risks related to the market generally**

**_The secondary market generally._**

Although application will be made to admit the Securities to trading on the Market, the Securities may have no
established trading market when issued, and one may never develop or continue or, if one does develop, be
maintained. If a market does develop, it may not be liquid. Therefore, investors may not be able to sell their
Securities easily or at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to similar investments that have a
developed secondary market. This is particularly the case for securities that are especially sensitive to interest
rate, currency or market risks, are designed for specific investment objectives or strategies or have been
prepared to meet the investment requirements of limited categories of investors. These types of securities
generally would have a more limited secondary market and more price volatility than conventional debt
securities. Illiquidity may have a severely adverse effect on the market value of the Securities.

The development or continued liquidity of any secondary market for the Securities will be affected by a number
of factors such as general economic conditions, the financial condition, the creditworthiness of the Issuer and/or
the Group, and the value of any applicable reference rate, as well as other factors such as the complexity and
volatility of the reference rate, the method of calculating the return to be paid in respect of such Securities, the
outstanding amount of the Securities, any redemption features of the Securities, the performance of other
instruments linked to the reference rates and the level, direction and volatility of interest rates generally. Such
factors also will affect the market value of the Securities. In addition, certain securities may be designed for
specific investment objectives or strategies and therefore may have a more limited secondary market and
experience more price volatility than conventional debt securities.

Investors may not be able to sell Securities readily or at prices that will enable investors to realise their
anticipated yield. Accordingly, the price at which a Holder will be able to sell their Securities may be at a
discount, which could be substantial, from the issue price or the purchase price paid by such holder.

**_Exchange rate risks and exchange controls._**

The Issuer will repay principal of and pay interest on the Securities in euro. This presents certain risks relating to
currency or currency unit conversions if an investor’s financial activities are denominated principally in a
currency or a currency unit (the Investor’s Currency) other than euro. These include the risk that exchange rates
may significantly change (including changes due to devaluation of euro, or revaluation of the Investor’s
Currency) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor’s Currency may impose or modify
exchange controls. An appreciation in the value of the Investor’s Currency relative to euro, would decrease (1)
the Investor’s Currency equivalent yield on the Securities, (2) the Investor’s Currency equivalent value of the
principal payable on the Securities and (3) the Investor’s Currency equivalent market value of the Securities.

Government and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that could
adversely affect an applicable exchange rate. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than
expected, or no interest or principal.


-----

**_Legal considerations may restrict certain investments._**

The investment activities of certain investors are subject to investment laws and regulations, or review or
regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor should determine whether the Securities are a lawful
investment for it, and the regulatory implications for it of making such an investment.

**_Interest rate risks._**

Investment in the Securities involves the risk that subsequent changes in market interest rates may adversely
affect the value of the Securities. Fluctuations in interest rates can affect the market values of, and corresponding
levels of capital gains or losses on, fixed rate securities. During periods of rising interest rates, the prices of
fixed rate securities, such as the Securities, tend to fall and gains are reduced or losses incurred upon their sale.
Therefore, investment in the Securities involves the risk that changes in market interest rates may adversely
affect the value of the Securities.

**_The Interest rate reset may result in a decline of yield._**

As the Securities feature a fixed interest rate that will be reset during the term of the Securities, Holders are
exposed to the risk of fluctuating interest rate levels and uncertain interest income. Fluctuating interest rate levels
make it impossible to determine the yield of such securities in advance.

**Issue Size** €625,000,000

**Issue Date** 27 May 2021

**Issue Price** 99.409 per cent.

**Interest** The Securities will bear interest on their principal amount from (and
including) the Issue Date to (but excluding) the First Reset Date at a
rate of 2.875 per cent. per annum, payable annually in arrear on 27
August in each year, except that the first payment of interest, to be

2031 at a rate per annum which shall be 3.19 per cent. above the 5 year
Swap Rate (as defined in the Conditions) for the Reset Period (as

shall be 3.44 per cent. above the 5 year Swap Rate for the Reset Period

_“Benchmark Discontinuation”._


-----

**Benchmark Discontinuation** If a Benchmark Event occurs in relation to the Original Reference
Rate, then the Issuer shall use its reasonable endeavours to appoint an
Independent Adviser, as soon as reasonably practicable, in accordance
with Condition 7(j) (Benchmark Discontinuation), with a view to such
Independent Adviser determining a Successor Rate, failing which an
Alternative Rate and, in either case, an Adjustment Spread (if any) and
any Benchmark Amendments.

If the Issuer is unable to appoint an Independent Adviser, or the
Independent Adviser fails to determine a Successor Reference Rate or
Alternative Reference Rate in accordance with the Conditions, then the
Subsequent Fixed Interest Rate applicable to the next succeeding Reset
Period shall be equal to the last annualised mid-swap rate with a term
of five years displayed on the Reset Screen Page as determined by the
Agent Bank.

**Optional Interest Deferral** The Issuer may, at its discretion, elect to defer all or part of any Interest
Payment (a Deferred Interest Payment) which is otherwise scheduled
to be paid on an Interest Payment Date by giving a Deferral Notice of
such election to the Holders, the Fiscal Agent, the Registrar and the
Paying Agents. Subject as described in “Mandatory Settlement”, if the
Issuer elects not to make all or part of any Interest Payment on an
Interest Payment Date, then it will not have any obligation to pay such
interest on the relevant Interest Payment Date and any such nonpayment of interest will not constitute an Enforcement Event or any
other breach of its obligations under the Securities or for any other
purpose.

Arrears of Interest may be satisfied at the option of the Issuer in whole
or in part at any time (the Optional Deferred Interest Settlement Date)
following delivery of a notice to such effect given by the Issuer to the
Holders, the Fiscal Agent, the Registrar and the Paying Agents
informing them of its election to so satisfy such Arrears of Interest (or
part thereof) and specifying the Optional Deferred Interest Settlement
Date.

Any Deferred Interest Payment (or part thereof) shall itself bear
interest (such further interest together with the Deferred Interest
Payment, being **_Arrears of Interest), at the Interest Rate prevailing_**
from time to time, from (and including) the date on which (but for such
deferral) the Deferred Interest Payment would otherwise have been due
to be made to (but excluding) the Optional Deferred Interest Settlement
Date or, as appropriate, such other date on which such Deferred
Interest Payment is paid in accordance with Condition 8(b), in each
case such further interest being compounded on each Interest Payment
Date. Non-payment of Arrears of Interest shall not constitute a default
by the Issuer under the Securities or for any other purpose, unless such
payment is required in accordance with Condition 8(b) of the
Securities.

**Status of the Securities** The Securities constitute direct, unsecured and subordinated
obligations of the Issuer and rank _pari passu and without any_
preference among themselves.

**Subordination of the Securities** In the event of: (a) an order being made, or an effective resolution
being passed, for the winding-up of the Issuer (except, in any such
case, a solvent winding-up solely for the purposes of a reorganisation,
restructuring, reconstruction, merger, conversion, amalgamation or the
substitution in place of the Issuer of a New Issuer in accordance with
Condition 18, the terms of which reorganisation, restructuring,
reconstruction, merger, conversion, amalgamation or substitution (x)


-----

are authorised or permitted in accordance with the provisions of the
Conditions or have previously been approved by an Extraordinary
Resolution (as defined in the Fiscal Agency Agreement) and (y) do not
provide that the Securities shall thereby become redeemable or
repayable in accordance with the Conditions); (b) an administrator or
receiver of the Issuer being appointed and such administrator or
receiver giving notice that it intends to declare and distribute a
dividend or distribution; or (c) any analogous event relating to the
Issuer to those described in (a) and (b) above under any insolvency,
bankruptcy or similar law applicable to the Issuer, the rights and claims
of the Holders against the Issuer in respect of or arising under the
Securities will rank (i) junior to the claims of all holders of Senior
Obligations of the Issuer, (ii) pari passu with the claims of holders of
all Parity Obligations of the Issuer and (iii) senior to the claims of
holders of all Junior Obligations of the Issuer. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks related to the Securities generally—Limited Remedies”._

**Status of the Guarantee** The payment obligations under the Guarantee constitute direct,
unsecured and subordinated obligations of the Guarantor and rank pari
_passu and without any preference among themselves._

**Subordination of the Guarantee** In the event of: (a) an order being made, or an effective resolution
being passed, for the winding-up of the Guarantor (except, in any such
case, a solvent winding-up solely for the purposes of a reorganisation,
restructuring, reconstruction, merger, conversion, amalgamation or a
substitution in accordance with Condition 19, the terms of which
reorganisation, restructuring, reconstruction, merger, conversion,
amalgamation or substitution (x) are authorised or permitted in
accordance with the provisions of the Conditions or have previously
been approved by an Extraordinary Resolution (as defined in the Fiscal
Agency Agreement) and (y) do not provide that the Securities shall
thereby become redeemable or repayable in accordance with the
Conditions); (b) an administrator or receiver of the Guarantor being
appointed and such administrator or receiver giving notice that it
intends to declare and distribute a dividend or distribution in respect of
the partnership interests (or, after a substitution pursuant to Condition
19, any other ownership interests) of the Guarantor; or (c) any
analogous event relating to the Guarantor to those described in (a) and
(b) above under any insolvency, bankruptcy or similar law applicable
to the Guarantor, the rights and claims of Holders against the Guarantor
in respect of or arising under the Guarantee will rank (i) junior to the
claims of the holders of all Senior Obligations of the Guarantor, (ii)
_pari passu_ with the claims of the holders of all Parity Obligations of
the Guarantor and (iii) senior to the claims of the holders of all
Junior Obligations of the Guarantor. See “Risk Factors—Risks related
_to the Securities generally—Limited Remedies”._

**Mandatory Settlement** Notwithstanding the provisions of “Optional Interest Deferral”, the
Issuer shall pay any outstanding Arrears of Interest, in whole but not in
part, on the first occurring Mandatory Settlement Date following the
Interest Payment Date on which a Deferred Interest Payment first
arose.

_If a Mandatory Settlement Date does not occur prior to the calendar_
_day which is the fifth anniversary of the Interest Payment Date on_
_which the Deferred Interest Payment first arose, it is the intention,_
_though not an obligation, of the Issuer to pay all outstanding Arrears_
_of Interest (in whole, but not in part) on the next following Interest_
_Payment Date._


-----

**No fixed maturity** The Securities will be perpetual securities in respect of which there is
no fixed redemption date.

**Optional Redemption** The Issuer may redeem all, but not some only of the Securities during
the period commencing on (and including) 27 May 2026 to (and
including) the First Reset Date or on any Call Date thereafter, at their
principal amount together with any accrued and unpaid interest up to
(but excluding) the redemption date and any outstanding Arrears of
Interest.

In addition, the Issuer may redeem all, but not some only, of the
Securities on any date prior to 27 May 2026 at an amount equal to the
Make-whole Redemption Amount as described in Condition 9(c)
(Redemption of the Issuer (Make-whole)).

**Special Event Redemption** If a Special Event has occurred and is continuing, then the Issuer may
redeem at any time all, but not some only, of the Securities at:

(i) in the case of a Capital Event, Tax Deduction Event or
Accounting Event where the relevant date fixed for
redemption falls prior to 27 May 2026, 101 per cent. of their
principal amount;

(ii) in the case of a Capital Event, Tax Deduction Event or
Accounting Event where the relevant date fixed for
redemption falls on or after 27 May 2026, their principal
amount; or

(iii) in the case of a Change of Control Event, Substantial
Repurchase Event or a Withholding Tax Event where any
such redemption occurs at any time, their principal amount,

in each case together with any accrued and unpaid interest up to (but
excluding) the redemption date and any outstanding Arrears of Interest.

**Change of Control** If a Change of Control Event has occurred and is continuing, the Issuer
may elect to redeem all, but not some only, of the Securities at any
time at 100 per cent. of their principal amount together with any
accrued and unpaid interest up to (but excluding) the redemption date
and any outstanding Arrears of Interest.

If the Issuer does not elect to redeem the Securities following the
occurrence of a Change of Control Event, the then prevailing Interest
Rate, and each subsequent Interest Rate, on the Securities shall be
increased by 5 per cent. per annum with effect from (and including) the
date on which the Change of Control Event occurred. See “Terms and
_Conditions of the Securities—Interest Payments—Step-up after Change_
_of Control Event”._

**Substitution or Variation** If an Accounting Event, a Capital Event, a Tax Deduction Event or a
Withholding Tax Event has occurred and is continuing, without the
consent of Holders the Issuer may either (i) substitute all, but not some
only, of the Securities for, or (ii) vary the terms of the Securities with
the effect that they remain or become, as the case may be, Qualifying
Securities, in each case in accordance with Condition 10 thereof and
subject, inter alia, to the receipt by the Fiscal Agent of the certificate of
the directors of the Issuer and the relevant opinions referred to in
Condition 11 thereof.

**Substitution of Issuer** Subject to the provisions set out in “Terms and Conditions of the
_Securities – Substitution of Issuer”, the Issuer may at any time_
substitute for itself as the principal debtor under the Securities, the


-----

of the Issuer provided that (i) a deed poll and such other documents (if
any) are executed by the New Issuer and, to the extent necessary, the
other parties to the Fiscal Agency Agreement, as may be necessary to
give full effect to the substitution and pursuant to which the New Issuer
undertakes in favour of each Holder and each Accountholder (as
defined in the Deed of Covenant) to be bound by the Conditions, the
Deed of Covenant and the Fiscal Agency Agreement as principal
debtor in respect of the Securities in place of the Issuer, (ii) each
Rating Agency confirms that upon the substitution of the New Issuer
becoming effective the Securities will either have the same credit
rating as immediately prior to the substitution or the credit rating will
not be adversely affected, (iii) each Rating Agency confirms that upon
such substitution becoming effective the Securities will either still be
eligible for the same, or a higher amount of, “equity credit” (or such
other nomenclature that the Rating Agency may then use to describe
the degree to which an instrument exhibits the characteristics of an
ordinary share) as is attributed to the Securities on the date
immediately prior to such substitution or such eligibility or attribution
will not be adversely affected, (iv) the Fiscal Agent has received legal
opinions addressed to the Holders from legal advisers of internationally
recognised standing approved by it to the effect, inter alia, that (A) the
New Issuer has obtained all governmental and regulatory approvals
and consents necessary for its assumption of the obligations and
liabilities as principal debtor under the Conditions, the Deed of
Covenant and the Fiscal Agency Agreement in place of the Issuer, the
Holders have rights against the New Issuer at least equivalent to the
rights they have against the Issuer, subject to the other conditions in
Condition 18 having been satisfied such assumption is fully effective
and such obligations and liabilities are legally valid and binding on,
and enforceable against, the New Issuer; (B) such approvals and
consents are in full force and effect at the time of substitution; and (C)
confirming, with respect to the New Issuer, compliance with (v) below,
(v) all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Securities by
or on behalf of the New Issuer shall be made free and clear of and
without withholding or deduction for or on account of any taxes,

tax jurisdiction to which it is subject or any political subdivision
thereof or any authority thereof or therein having power to tax, (vi) any
stock exchange on which the Securities are listed confirms to the Issuer
and the Fiscal Agent that, after giving effect to the substitution, the
Securities will continue to be listed on such stock exchange, (vii) two

that the New Issuer is solvent at the time at which the substitution or
appointment is proposed to be effected and (viii) two Authorised

Issuer certify to the Fiscal Agent that, following consultation with an
independent investment bank of international repute, an independent
financial adviser with appropriate expertise or independent counsel of
recognised standing, the Issuer or, as the case may be, the New Issuer
has concluded that such substitution (i) will not result in the New
Issuer having an entitlement, as at the date such substitution becomes
effective, to redeem the Securities as a result of a Special Event and (ii)
will not result in the terms of the Securities immediately following
such substitution being materially less favourable to holders than the
terms of the Securities immediately prior to such substitution.

**Substitution of Guarantor and** The Deed of Guarantee contains provisions which (i) allow the
Guarantor at any time to substitute itself for another entity in the Group


-----

**termination of Guarantee** or a successor in business of the Guarantor; and (ii) for so long as SES

of the Guarantee where (A) an order is made by any competent court or
effective resolution passed for the winding up or dissolution of SES

higher amount of, “equity credit” (or such other nomenclature that the
Rating Agency may then use to describe the degree to which an
instrument exhibits the characteristics of an ordinary share) as is
attributed to the Securities on the date immediately prior to such
substitution or termination or such eligibility or attribution will not be
adversely affected, (iv) in the case of a termination of the Guarantee
only, two Authorised Signatories of the Issuer shall have certified to
the Fiscal Agent that the requirements of Condition 19 have been
fulfilled prior to such termination taking effect and (v) two Authorised
Signatories of the Issuer or two Authorised Signatories of the
Guarantor certify to the Fiscal Agent that, following consultation with
an independent investment bank of international repute, an independent
financial adviser with appropriate expertise or independent counsel of

has concluded that such substitution or termination (i) will not result in
the Issuer having an entitlement, as at the date such substitution or
termination becomes effective, to redeem the Securities as a result of a
Special Event and (ii) in the case of a substitution only, will not result
in the terms of the Securities and the Guarantee (taken together)
immediately following such substitution being materially less
favourable to holders than the terms of the Securities and the Guarantee
(taken together) immediately prior to such substitution.

**Enforcement Event** If a default is made by the Issuer and the Guarantor for a period of 14
days or more in the payment of principal or 21 days or more in the
payment of interest, in each case in respect of the Securities and which
is due, then any Holder may, at its sole discretion, institute
proceedings for the winding-up of the Issuer and/or the Guarantor
and/or prove in the winding-up of the Issuer and/or the Guarantor
and/or claim in the liquidation of the Issuer and/or the Guarantor, for
such payment, and in the event of a winding up of the Issuer in a
manner falling within Condition 14(a), any Holder shall be entitled to
claim for all unpaid principal in respect of a Security it holds together
with any accrued and unpaid interest up to (but excluding) such date
and any outstanding Arrears of Interest in respect of any such Security,
with such rights and claims subordinated as provided in Condition 3(a).

**Additional Amounts** Payments in respect of the Securities shall be made free and clear of,


-----

and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, taxes of
Luxembourg or the United States or any political subdivision or any
authority thereof or therein having power to tax, unless such
withholding or deduction is required by law. In the event that any such
withholding or deduction is made, additional amounts may be payable
by the Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be, subject to certain
exceptions as are more fully described under “Terms and Conditions of
_the Securities—Taxation”._

**Form** The Securities will be in registered form represented on issue by a
global certificate (the **_Global Certificate) which will be registered in_**
the name of a nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg on
the Issue Date. Save in limited circumstances, Certificates will not be
issued in exchange for interests in the Global Certificate.

**Listing and Admission to Trading** Application has been made to list the Securities on the Official List and
to be admitted to trading on the Regulated Market.

**Denominations** The Securities will be issued in denominations of €100,000 and
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. No certificates will be
issued with a denomination below €100,000. See further “The Global
_Certificate”._

**Governing Law** English law save for the provisions relating to subordination of the
Securities contained in Condition 3(a) which shall, subject to the
provisions of Condition 18(d) (Substitution of Issuer) and Condition
19(f) (Substitution of Guarantor and termination of Guarantee), be
governed by the laws of Luxembourg and the provisions relating to
subordination of the Guarantee contained in Condition 6(a) (and
corresponding provisions of the Guarantee) which shall be governed by
the laws of Delaware.

**Ratings** The Securities are expected to be rated BB by Standard & Poor’s and
Ba1 by Moody’s. A rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold
securities and may be subject to suspension, reduction or withdrawal at
any time by the assigning rating agency. As of the date of this
Prospectus, each Rating Agency is a credit rating agency established in
the European Union and is registered under Regulation (EC) No
1060/2009 (as amended). As such each Rating Agency is included in
the list of credit rating agencies published by the European Securities
and Markets Authority on its website in accordance with such
Regulation.

In respect of the Moody’s rating of the Securities, obligations rated
“Ba” are judged to be speculative and are subject to substantial credit
risk. The modifier “1” indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher
end of its generic rating category. See further

[(https://www.moodys.com/).](https://www.moodys.com/)

In respect of the Standard & Poor’s rating of the Securities, obligations
rated 'BB', 'B', 'CCC', 'CC', and 'C' are regarded as having significant
speculative characteristics. 'BB' indicates the least degree of
speculation and 'C' the highest. An obligation rated 'BB' is less
vulnerable to non-payment than other speculative issues. However, it
faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business,
financial, or economic conditions that could lead to the obligor's
inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitments on the
[obligation (see further https://www.spglobal.com/).](https://www.spglobal.com/)


-----

**Use of Proceeds** The net proceeds of the issue of the Securities (amounting to
approximately €619,118,750) will be applied by the Issuer for general
corporate purposes and the possible refinancing of the existing hybrid
capital instruments.

**Selling Restrictions** The United States, the EEA, the United Kingdom and Singapore. See
“Subscription and Sale”.

Category 2 offering restrictions have been implemented for the
purposes of Regulation S under the Securities Act.

**Risk Factors** Prospective investors should carefully consider the information set out
in “Risk Factors” in conjunction with the other information contained
or incorporated by reference in this Prospectus.

**Replacement Intention** _The Issuer intends (without thereby assuming a legal obligation), that_
_if it redeems or repurchases any Securities (or any part thereof), it will_
_so redeem or repurchase the relevant Securities (or any part thereof)_
_only to the extent that such part of the aggregate principal amount of_
_the Securities (or any part thereof) to be redeemed or repurchased as_
_was categorised as equity by S&P at the time of its issuance (“equity_
_credit”) does not exceed such part of the net proceeds received by the_
_Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer on or prior to the date of such_
_redemption or repurchase from the sale or issuance by the Issuer or_
_such Subsidiary to third party purchasers (other than group entities of_
_the Issuer) of securities which are assigned by S&P, as the case may_
_be, an aggregate “equity credit” (or such similar nomenclature used_
_by S&P from time to time) that is equal to or greater than the “equity_
_credit” assigned to the relevant Securities (or any part thereof) to be_
_redeemed or repurchased at the time of their issuance (but taking into_
_account any changes in hybrid capital methodology or the_
_interpretation thereof since the issuance of the relevant Securities),_
_unless:_

_(i)_ _the long-term corporate rating (or such similar nomenclature_
_then used by S&P) assigned by S&P to the Issuer is at least_
_the same as or higher than the long-term corporate credit_
_rating assigned to the Issuer on the date of the last additional_
_hybrid issuance (excluding any refinancing transaction of the_
_hybrid securities which were assigned a similar "equity_
_credit" by S&P (or such similar nomenclature then used by_
_S&P) and the Issuer is of the view that such rating would not_
_fall below this level as a result of such redemption or_
_repurchase; or_

_(ii)_ _in the case of a repurchase, such repurchase is of less than (i)_
_10 per cent. of the aggregate hybrid capital outstanding in_
_any period of 12 consecutive months or (ii) 25 per cent. of the_
_hybrid capital outstanding in any period of 10 consecutive_
_years; or_

_(iii)_ _the relevant Securities are redeemed pursuant to a Capital_

_Event, an Accounting Event, a Tax Deduction Event, a_
_Withholding Tax Event, a Substantial Repurchase Event or_
_Change of Control Event; or_

_(iv)_ _the relevant Securities are not assigned an “equity credit” by_
_S&P (or such similar nomenclature then used by S&P) at the_
_time of such redemption or repurchase; or_

_(v)_ _in the case of a repurchase, such repurchase relates to an_
_aggregate principal amount of Securities which is less than or_
_equal to the excess (if any) above the maximum aggregate_
_principal amount of the Issuer’s hybrid capital to which S&P_
_then assigns equity content under its prevailing methodology,_

**_(a)_** **_Form and Denomination_**

The Securities are issued in registered form in the denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000
in excess thereof up to and including €199,000. A security certificate (each a Certificate) will be issued to each
holder in respect of its registered holding of Securities. Each Certificate will be serially numbered with an
identifying number which will be recorded on the relevant Certificate and in the register of holders which the
Issuer will procure to be kept by the Registrar (the Register).

The Issuer will maintain a register of holders of the Securities at its registered office in accordance with the
provisions of the Luxembourg law of 10 August 1915 on commercial companies, as amended, which shall
match the Register with regard to the entries therein. In the event of any discrepancy between the Register and
the register held by the Issuer at its registered office, the register held by the Issuer at its registered office shall
prevail for Luxembourg law purposes.

The Fiscal Agency Agreement contains provisions which oblige the Registrar promptly to provide an updated
copy of the Register to the Issuer on the Issue Date and at any time following any amendment to the Register, in
order to allow the Issuer to update the register held by it at its registered office to reflect the Register.

**_(b)_** **_Title_**

Title to the Securities passes only by registration in the Register. The holder of any Security will (except as
otherwise required by law) be treated as its absolute owner for all purposes (whether or not it is overdue and


-----

regardless of any notice of ownership, trust or any interest in it, any writing on it, or its theft or loss of, the
Certificate issued in respect of it) and no person will be liable for so treating the holder. In these Conditions,
**_Holder or holder means the person in whose name a Security is registered in the Register._**

**_(c)_** **_Transfers_**

A Security may be transferred by depositing the Certificate issued in respect of that Security, with the form of
transfer on the back duly completed and signed, at the specified office of the Registrar or any of the Transfer
Agents.

**_(d)_** **_Delivery of new Certificates_**

Each new Certificate to be issued upon transfer of Securities will, within five business days of receipt by the
Registrar or the relevant Transfer Agent of the duly completed form of transfer endorsed on the relevant
Certificate, be mailed by uninsured mail at the risk of the Holder entitled to the Security to the address specified
in the form of transfer. For the purposes of this Condition, **_business day_** shall mean a day on which banks are
open for business in the city in which the specified office of the Registrar or Transfer Agent with whom a
Certificate is deposited in connection with a transfer is located.

Where some but not all of the Securities in respect of which a Certificate is issued are to be transferred, a new
Certificate in respect of the Securities not so transferred will, within five business days of receipt by the
Registrar or the relevant Transfer Agent of the original Certificate, be mailed by uninsured mail at the risk of the
Holder of the Securities not so transferred to the address of such Holder appearing on the Register or as
specified in the form of transfer.

**_(e)_** **_Formalities free of charge_**

Registration of transfer of Securities will be effected without charge by or on behalf of the Issuer, the Registrar
or any Transfer Agent upon payment (or the giving of such indemnity as the Issuer, the Registrar or any
Transfer Agent may reasonably require) in respect of any stamp duty, tax or other governmental charges which
may be imposed in relation to such transfer.

**_(f)_** **_Closed periods_**

No Holder may require the transfer of a Security to be registered during the period of 15 days ending on the due

Interest Payment Date.

**_(g)_** **_Regulations_**

All transfers of Securities and entries on the Register will be made subject to such reasonable regulations as the
Issuer and the Registrar may from time to time prescribe (the initial such regulations being set out in Schedule 3
to the Fiscal Agency Agreement).

Issuer in accordance with Condition 18 (Substitution of Issuer), the terms of which reorganisation,
restructuring, reconstruction, merger, conversion, amalgamation or substitution (x) are authorised or
permitted in accordance with the provisions of these Conditions or have previously been approved by
an Extraordinary Resolution and (y) do not provide that the Securities shall thereby become redeemable
or repayable in accordance with these Conditions);

(b) an administrator or receiver of the Issuer being appointed and such administrator or receiver giving

The Guarantor has, subject to the provisions of Condition 19 (Substitution of Guarantor and termination of
_Guarantee), unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed the due payment of all sums expressed to be payable by_

accordance with Condition 19 (Substitution of Guarantor and termination of Guarantee), the terms of
which reorganisation, restructuring, reconstruction, merger, conversion, amalgamation, substitution or

of the holders of all Parity Obligations of the Guarantor and (iii) senior to the claims of the holders of all Junior
Obligations of the Guarantor.

Nothing in this Condition 6(a) shall affect or prejudice the payment of the costs, charges, expenses, liabilities or

_through (c) above before the Holders may expect to obtain any recovery in respect of the Guarantee and prior_
_thereto Holders will have only limited ability to influence the conduct of such winding-up or administration. See_

rights of set-off, compensation or retention.


-----

**7** **Interest Payments**

**_(a)_** **_Interest Rate_**

The Securities bear interest on their principal amount at the applicable Interest Rate from (and including) 27
May 2021 (the Issue Date) in accordance with the provisions of this Condition 7.

Subject to Condition 8 (Optional Interest Deferral), interest shall be payable on the Securities annually in arrear
on each Interest Payment Date as provided in this Condition 7, except that the first payment of interest, to be
made on 27 August 2021, will be in respect of the period from (and including) the Issue Date to (but excluding)
27 August 2021 and will amount to €7.247 per Calculation Amount (as defined below).

**_(b)_** **_Interest Accrual_**

The Securities will cease to bear interest from (and including) the date of redemption thereof pursuant to the
relevant paragraph of Condition 9 (Redemption) or the date of substitution thereof pursuant to Condition 10
(Substitution or Variation), as the case may be, unless payment of all amounts due in respect of the Securities is
not made, in which event interest shall continue to accrue in respect of unpaid amounts on the Securities, both
before and after judgment, and shall be payable, as provided in these Conditions up to (but excluding) the
Relevant Date.

Save as provided in Condition 7(c), where it is necessary to calculate an amount of interest in respect of any
Security for a period which is less than a complete year, such interest shall be calculated on the basis of the
actual number of days in the period from (and including) the most recent Interest Payment Date (or, if none, the
Issue Date) to (but excluding) the relevant payment date divided by the actual number of days in the period from
(and including) the most recent Interest Payment Date (or, if none, the Issue Date) to (but excluding) the next (or
first) scheduled Interest Payment Date.

Where it is necessary to calculate an amount of interest in respect of any Security for a period of more than one
year, such interest shall be the aggregate of the interest payable in respect of a full year plus the interest payable
in respect of the remaining period calculated in the manner as aforesaid.

Interest in respect of any Security shall be calculated per €1,000 in principal amount thereof (the **_Calculation_**
**_Amount). The amount of interest payable per Calculation Amount for any period shall, save as provided in_**
Condition 7(c), be equal to the product of the relevant Interest Rate, the Calculation Amount and the day count
fraction as described in this Condition 7(b) for the relevant period, rounding the resulting figure to the nearest
cent (half a cent being rounded upwards). The amount of interest payable in respect of each Security shall be the
aggregate of the amounts (determined in the manner provided above) for each Calculation Amount comprising
the denomination of such Security without any further rounding.

**_(c)_** **_First Fixed Interest Rate_**

For each Interest Period ending on or before the First Reset Date and subject to Condition 8 (Optional Interest
_Deferral), the Securities bear interest at the rate of 2.875 per cent. per annum (the_ **_First Fixed Interest Rate),_**
payable annually in arrear on the Interest Payment Date in each year, except that the first payment of interest, to
be made on 27 August 2021, will be in respect of the period from (and including) the Issue Date to (but
excluding) 27 August 2021 and will amount to €7.247 per Calculation Amount.

**_(d)_** **_Subsequent Fixed Interest Rates_**

For each Interest Period which commences on or after the First Reset Date and subject to Condition 8 (Optional
_Interest Deferral), the Securities bear interest at the relevant Subsequent Fixed Interest Rate. Such interest shall_
be payable annually in arrear on the Interest Payment Date in each year and shall be calculated, subject to
Condition 7(i) below, as follows:


-----

Subsequent Fixed Interest Rate = 5 year Swap Rate + Margin

all as determined by the Agent Bank and where,

**_5 year Swap Rate means the annual mid-swap rate for a term of 5 years as displayed on Reuters screen “ICE_**
SWAP 2” as at 11:00 a.m. (Central European time) or, if such rate is not displayed on such screen as at the
relevant time, the mid-swap rate as displayed on a successor page (in each case, the Reset Screen Page) on the
day falling two Business Days prior to the first day of the relevant Reset Period (the **_Reset Interest_**
**_Determination Date)._**

If the 5 year Swap Rate does not appear on the Reset Screen Page on the Reset Interest Determination Date, the
5 year Swap Rate will be the Reset Reference Bank Rate on such Reset Interest Determination Date;

**_Reset Reference Bank Rate means the percentage rate determined on the basis of the 5 year Swap Rate_**
Quotations provided by five major banks in the Euro-zone interbank market (the Reset Reference Banks) to the
Agent Bank at approximately 11:00 a.m. (Central European time) on such Reset Interest Determination Date. If
at least three quotations are provided, the 5 year Swap Rate will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations,
eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in
the event of equality, one of the lowest);

the **_5 year Swap Rate Quotations means, in respect of each Interest Period falling within a Reset Period, the_**
arithmetic mean of the bid and offered rates for the annual fixed leg (calculated on a 30/360 day count basis) of
a fixed-for-floating euro interest rate swap which (i) has a term of 5 years commencing on the relevant Reset
Interest Determination Date, (ii) is in an amount that is representative of a single transaction in the relevant
market at the relevant time with an acknowledged dealer of good credit in the swap market, and (iii) has a
floating leg based on the 6-month EURIBOR rate (calculated on an Actual/360 day count basis); and

**_Margin means in respect of (i) the Reset Period ending on (but excluding) 27 August 2031, 3.19 per cent.; (ii)_**
each Reset Period which falls in the period commencing on (and including) 27 August 2031 and ending on (but
excluding) 27 August 2046, 3.44 per cent.; and (iii) each Reset Period which falls on or after 27 August 2046,
4.19 per cent.

If on any Reset Interest Determination Date, only two quotations are provided, the Reset Reference Bank Rate
will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations provided. If on any Reset Interest Determination Date only one or
none of the Reset Reference Banks provides the Agent Bank with a 5 year Swap Rate Quotation as provided in
the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, then the Reset Reference Bank Rate shall be equal to the 5-year
Swap Rate last appearing on the Reset Screen Page (the **_Last Appearing Rate) as determined by the Agent_**
Bank.

The Subsequent Fixed Interest Rate shall be determined as provided above in respect of each Reset Period and,
as so determined, such rate shall apply to each Interest Period falling within that Reset Period.

For the purposes of this Condition 7(d), the Agent Bank shall not be responsible to the Issuer or to any third
party as a result of the Agent Bank having relied upon or acted on any quotation or information given to it for
the purposes of calculating the Subsequent Fixed Interest Rate or the Reset Reference Bank Rate which
subsequently may be found to be incorrect or inaccurate in any way or for any losses whatsoever resulting from
acting in accordance therewith.

**_(e)_** **_Determination of Subsequent Fixed Interest Rates_**

The Agent Bank will, as soon as practicable after 11.00 a.m. (Central European time) on each Reset Interest
Determination Date, determine the Subsequent Fixed Interest Rate in respect of each Interest Period falling
within the relevant Reset Period.


-----

**_(f)_** **_Publication of Subsequent Fixed Interest Rates_**

The Issuer shall cause notice of each Subsequent Fixed Interest Rate determined in accordance with this
Condition 7 in respect of each relevant Interest Period to be given to the Fiscal Agent, the Registrar, the Paying
Agents, any stock exchange on which the Securities are for the time being listed or admitted to trading and, in
accordance with Condition 21 (Notices), the Holders, in each case as soon as practicable after its determination
but in any event not later than the fourth Business Day thereafter.

**_(g)_** **_Agent Bank and Reset Reference Banks_**

With effect from the Reset Interest Determination Date relating to the First Reset Date, the Issuer will maintain
an Agent Bank and five Reset Reference Banks where the Interest Rate is to be calculated by reference to them.
The name of the initial Agent Bank and its initial specified office is set out at the end of these Conditions.

The Issuer may from time to time replace the Agent Bank with another leading financial institution in London,
Paris or Luxembourg. If the Agent Bank is unable or unwilling to continue to act as the Agent Bank or fails duly
to determine a Subsequent Fixed Interest Rate in respect of any Interest Period as provided in Condition 7(d),
the Issuer shall forthwith appoint another leading financial institution in London, Paris or Luxembourg to act as
such in its place. The Agent Bank may not resign its duties or be removed without a successor having been
appointed as aforesaid.

**_(h)_** **_Determinations of Agent Bank Binding_**

All notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates, calculations, quotations and decisions given, expressed,
made or obtained for the purposes of this Condition 7 by the Agent Bank shall (in the absence of wilful default,
manifest error or negligence) be binding on the Issuer, the Guarantor, the other Agents and all Holders and (in
the absence of wilful default, manifest error or negligence) no liability to the Holders or the Issuer shall attach to
the Agent Bank in connection with the exercise or non-exercise by it of any of its powers, duties and discretions.

**_(i)_** **_Step-up after Change of Control Event_**

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Condition 7, if the Issuer does not elect to redeem the Securities in
accordance with Condition 9(h) (Redemption for Change of Control Event) following the occurrence of a
Change of Control Event, the then prevailing Interest Rate, and each subsequent Interest Rate otherwise
determined in accordance with the provisions of this Condition 7, on the Securities shall be increased by 5 per
cent. per annum with effect from (and including) the date on which the Change of Control Event occurred.

**_(j)_** **_Benchmark Discontinuation_**

(i) Notwithstanding the provisions above in this Condition 7, if the Issuer determines that a Benchmark
Event has occurred in relation to the Original Reference Rate when any Subsequent Fixed Interest Rate
(or any component part thereof) remains to be determined by reference to such Original Reference Rate,
the Issuer shall use its reasonable endeavours to appoint an Independent Adviser, as soon as reasonably
practicable, with a view to the Independent Adviser determining a Successor Rate, failing which an
Alternative Rate (in accordance with Condition 7(j)(ii)) and, in either case, an Adjustment Spread and
any Benchmark Amendments (in accordance with Condition 7(j)(iv)).

In making such determination and any other determination pursuant to this Condition 7(j), the
Independent Adviser shall act in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner as an expert. In the
absence of bad faith or fraud, the Independent Adviser shall have no liability whatsoever to the Issuer, the
Agents or the Holders for the making of any determination or for any advice given to the Issuer in
connection with any determination made by the Issuer, pursuant to this Condition 7(j).


-----

If (i) the Issuer is unable to appoint an Independent Advisor; or (ii) the Independent Adviser fail to
determine a Successor Rate or, failing which, an Alternative Rate in accordance with this Condition
7(j)(i) prior to the date which is 10 business days prior to the relevant Reset Interest Determination Date
in respect of a relevant Reset Period, the Subsequent Fixed Interest Rate applicable to the next
succeeding Reset Period shall be equal to the last annualised mid-swap rate with a term of five years
displayed on the Reset Screen Page as determined by the Agent Bank. For the avoidance of doubt, this
paragraph shall apply to the relevant next succeeding Reset Period only and any subsequent Reset
Periods are subject to the subsequent operation of, and to adjustment as provided in, the first paragraph of
this Condition 7(j).

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Condition 7, if following the determination of any Successor
Rate, Alternative Rate, Adjustment Spread and/or any Benchmark Amendments, in the Agent Bank’s
opinion there is in relation to the Successor Rate, Alternative Rate, Adjustment Spread, any Benchmark
Amendments (and in particular, any Adjustment Spread) and the operation thereof any uncertainty
between two or more alternative courses of action in making any determination or calculation, the Agent
Bank shall promptly notify the Issuer thereof and the Issuer shall direct the Agent Bank in writing as to
which alternative course of action to adopt, following consultation with the Independent Adviser. If the
Agent Bank is not promptly provided with such direction, or is otherwise unable to make such
calculation or determination for any reason, it shall notify the Issuer thereof and the Agent Bank shall be
under no obligation to make such calculation or determination and (in the absence of such gross
negligence, wilful default or fraud) shall not incur any liability for not doing so.

(ii) If the Independent Adviser determines that:

(a) there is a Successor Rate, then such Successor Rate and the applicable Adjustment Spread
shall subsequently be used in place of the Original Reference Rate to determine the
Subsequent Fixed Interest Rate (or the relevant component part thereof) for all future
payments of interest on the Securities from the end of the then current Reset Period onwards
(subject to the operation of this Condition 7(j)); or

(b) there is no Successor Rate but that there is an Alternative Rate, then such Alternative Rate
and the applicable Adjustment Spread shall subsequently be used in place of the Original
Reference Rate to determine the Subsequent Fixed Interest Rate (or the relevant component
part thereof) for all future payments of interest on the Securities from the end of the then
current Reset Period onwards (subject to the operation of this Condition 7(j)).

(iii) The Adjustment Spread (or the formula or methodology for determining the Adjustment Spread) shall be
applied to the Successor Rate or the Alternative Rate (as the case may be). If the Independent Adviser is
unable to determine the quantum of, or a formula or methodology for determining, such Adjustment
Spread, then the Successor Rate or Alternative Rate (as applicable) will apply without an Adjustment
Spread.

(iv) If any Successor Rate or Alternative Rate and, in either case, the applicable Adjustment Spread is
determined in accordance with this Condition 7(j) and the Independent Adviser determines (i) that
amendments to these Conditions and/or the Fiscal Agency Agreement are necessary to ensure the proper
operation of such Successor Rate or Alternative Rate and, in either case, the applicable Adjustment
Spread (such amendments, the **_Benchmark Amendments) and (ii) the terms of the Benchmark_**
Amendments, then the Issuer shall, subject to giving notice thereof in accordance with Condition 7(j)(v),
without any requirement for the consent or approval of the Holders, vary these Conditions and/or the
Fiscal Agency Agreement to give effect to such Benchmark Amendments with effect from the date
specified in such notice.


-----

In connection with any such variation in accordance with this Condition 7(j)(iv), the Issuer shall comply
with the rules of any stock exchange on which the Securities are for the time being listed or admitted to
trading.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Condition 7(j), no Successor Rate or Alternative Rate will be
adopted, nor any Adjustment Spread applied, nor will any Benchmark Amendments be made, if and to
the extent that, in the determination of the Issuer, the same could reasonably be expected to cause a
Capital Event to occur.

(v) Any Successor Rate, Alternative Rate, Adjustment Spread and the specific terms of any Benchmark
Amendments determined under this Condition 7(j) will be notified promptly and in any event at least 10
Business Days prior to the next Reset Interest Determination Date by the Issuer to the Agents and, in
accordance with Condition 21 (Notices), the Holders. Such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify
the effective date of the Benchmark Amendments, if any.

No later than notifying the Agents of the same, the Issuer shall deliver to the Agents a certificate signed
by two directors of the Issuer:

(a) confirming (i) that a Benchmark Event has occurred, (ii) the Successor Rate or, as the case may
be, the Alternative Rate, (iii) the applicable Adjustment Spread and (iv) the specific terms of the
Benchmark Amendments (if any), in each case as determined in accordance with the provisions of
this Condition 7(j); and

(b) certifying that the Benchmark Amendments (if any) are necessary to ensure the proper operation
of such Successor Rate or Alternative Rate and (in either case) the applicable Adjustment Spread.

The Fiscal Agent shall display such certificate at its offices, for inspection by the Holders at all
reasonable times during normal business hours.

The Agents shall be entitled to rely on such certificate (without enquiry or liability to any person) as
sufficient evidence thereof. The Successor Rate or Alternative Rate and the Adjustment Spread and the
Benchmark Amendments (if any) specified in such certificate will (in the absence of manifest error or
bad faith in the determination of the Successor Rate or Alternative Rate and the Adjustment Spread and
the Benchmark Amendments (if any) and without prejudice to the Agents’ ability to rely on such
certificate as aforesaid) be binding on the Issuer, the Agents and the Holders.

(vi) Without prejudice to the obligations of the Issuer under Condition 7(j)(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), the Original
Reference Rate and the fallback provisions provided for in Condition 7(d) and the related definitions will
continue to apply unless and until the Issuer determines that a Benchmark Event has occurred and the
Agents have been notified of the Successor Rate or the Alternative Rate (as the case may be), and the
Adjustment Spread and any Benchmark Amendments, in accordance with Condition 7(j)(v).

(vii) As used in this Condition 7(j):

**_Adjustment Spread means either (a) a spread (which may be positive, negative or zero) or (b) a formula_**
or methodology for calculating a spread, in each case to be applied to the Successor Rate or the
Alternative Rate (as the case may be) and is the spread, formula or methodology which is notified to the
Agent Bank as being:

(a) in the case of a Successor Rate, is formally recommended in relation to the replacement of the
Original Reference Rate with the Successor Rate by any Relevant Nominating Body; or (if no
such recommendation has been made, or in the case of an Alternative Rate)

(b) the Independent Adviser and acting in good faith, determines is customarily applied to the relevant
Successor Rate or the Alternative Rate (as the case may be) in international debt capital markets


-----

transactions to produce an industry-accepted replacement rate for the Original Reference Rate; or
(if the Independent Adviser determines that no such spread is customarily applied)

(c) the Independent Adviser and acting in good faith, determines is recognised or acknowledged as
being the industry standard for over-the-counter derivative transactions which reference the
Original Reference Rate, where such rate has been replaced by the Successor Rate or the
Alternative Rate (as the case may be).

**_Alternative Rate means an alternative benchmark or screen rate which the Independent Adviser,_**
determines and notifies the Agent Bank is customarily applied in international debt capital markets
transactions for the purposes of determining resettable rates of interest (or the relevant component part
thereof) in euro.

**_Benchmark Amendments has the meaning given to it in Condition 7(j)(iv)._**

**_Benchmark Event means:_**

(1) the Original Reference Rate ceasing to be published for a period of at least five Business
Days or ceasing to exist; or

(2) a public statement by the administrator of the Original Reference Rate that it has ceased or
that it will cease publishing the Original Reference Rate permanently or indefinitely (in
circumstances where no successor administrator has been appointed that will continue
publication of the Original Reference Rate); or

(3) a public statement by the supervisor of the administrator of the Original Reference Rate, that
the Original Reference Rate has been or will be permanently or indefinitely discontinued; or

(4) a public statement by the supervisor of the administrator of the Original Reference Rate as a
consequence of which the Original Reference Rate will be prohibited from being used either
generally or in respect of the Securities; or

(5) a public statement by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of the Original
Reference Rate announcing that the Original Reference Rate is no longer representative of
its relevant underlying market or may no longer be used; or

(6) it has or will become unlawful for any Agent or the Issuer to calculate any payments due to
be made to any Holders using the Original Reference Rate,

-----

(Preconditions to Special Event Redemption, Change of Control Event Redemption, Substitution and Variation)
(without any requirement for the consent or approval of the Holders), and having given not fewer than 10 nor
more than 40 days’ notice to the Fiscal Agent, the Registrar and, in accordance with Condition 21 (Notices), the
Holders (which notice shall be irrevocable), at any time either (i) substitute all, but not some only, of the

and subject to the receipt by it of the certificate of two Authorised Signatories of the Issuer referred to in
Condition 11 (Preconditions to Special Event Redemption, Change of Control Event Redemption, Substitution
_and Variation)) agree to such substitution or variation._

Upon expiry of such notice, the Issuer shall either vary the terms of or, as the case may be, substitute the
Securities in accordance with this Condition 10.

The Fiscal Agent shall, at the expense of the Issuer, use reasonable endeavours to assist the Issuer in the
substitution of the Securities for, or the variation of the terms of the Securities so that they remain, or as
appropriate, become, Qualifying Securities, provided that the Fiscal Agent shall not be obliged to participate in,
or assist with, any such substitution or variation if the terms of the proposed Qualifying Securities or the
participation in or assistance with such substitution or variation would impose, in the Fiscal Agent’s opinion,
more onerous obligations upon it or expose it to liabilities or reduce its protections. If the Fiscal Agent does not
participate or assist as provided above, the Issuer may redeem the Securities as provided in Condition 9
(Redemption).

In connection with any substitution or variation in accordance with this Condition 10, the Issuer shall comply
with the rules of any stock exchange on which the Securities are for the time being listed or admitted to trading.

Any such substitution or variation in accordance with the foregoing provisions following a Substitution or
Variation Event shall only be permitted if it does not give rise to any other Substitution or Variation Event with
respect to the Qualifying Securities.

Any such substitution or variation in accordance with the foregoing provisions following a Substitution or
Variation Event shall only be permitted if it does not result in the Qualifying Securities no longer being eligible
for the same, or a higher amount of, “equity credit” (or such other nomenclature that the Rating Agency may
then use to describe the degree to which an instrument exhibits the characteristics of an ordinary share) as is
attributed to the Securities on the date notice is given to Holders of the substitution or variation.

In these Conditions, Qualifying Securities means securities that:

(a) are issued by the Issuer or any wholly-owned direct or indirect finance subsidiary of the Issuer with a
guarantee of such obligations by the Issuer and, in each case, continue to have the benefit of the
Guarantee on substantially the same terms as the Securities benefitted prior to such substitution or
variation;

(b) rank and (save in the case of a direct issue by the Issuer) benefit from a guarantee that ranks in relation
to the obligations of the Issuer under such securities and/or such guarantee (as the case may be),
equally with the Securities and pari passu in a winding-up or liquidation of the Issuer with any Parity
Obligations of the Issuer;

(c) contain terms not materially less favourable to Holders than the terms of the Securities (as reasonably
determined by the Issuer) and which:

(i) provide for the same or a more favourable Interest Rate from time to time as applied to the
Securities immediately prior to such substitution or variation and preserve the same Interest
Payment Dates;


-----

(ii) preserve the obligations (including the obligations arising from the exercise of any right) of the
Issuer as to principal and as to redemption of the Securities, including (without limitation) as
to timing of, and amounts payable upon, such redemption;

(iii) preserve any existing rights under these Conditions to any accrued interest, any Deferred
Interest Payments, any Arrears of Interest and any other amounts payable under the Securities
which, in each case, has accrued to Holders and not been paid;

(iv) do not provide for the mandatory deferral of payments of interest and/or principal;

(v) do not provide for loss absorption through principal write down or conversion to ordinary
shares; and

(vi) may include a feature which contains a term for the mandatory repayment of such securities on
a specified date which shall not be earlier than the date on which the next Call Date would
have fallen under the Securities (and the inclusion of such feature shall be deemed not to be
materially less favourable to Holders as compared with the terms of the Securities);

(d) are (i) listed on the official list of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on its
regulated market or (ii) listed on such other internationally recognised exchange platform in an OECD
country as is selected by the Issuer; and

(e) will have at least the same solicited credit rating from each Rating Agency as the credit rating ascribed
to the Securities by each such Rating Agency immediately prior to such substitution or variation.

**11** **Preconditions to Special Event Redemption, Change of Control Event Redemption, Substitution**

**and Variation**

Prior to the publication of any notice of redemption pursuant to Condition 9 (Redemption) (other than
redemption pursuant to Condition 9(b)) or any notice of substitution or variation pursuant to Condition 10
(Substitution and Variation), the Issuer shall deliver to the Fiscal Agent:

(a) a certificate signed by two Authorised Signatories of the Issuer stating that the relevant requirement or

circumstance giving rise to the right to redeem, substitute or vary is satisfied, and where the relevant Special
Event requires measures reasonably available to the Issuer to be taken, the relevant Special Event cannot be
avoided by the Issuer taking such measures. In relation to a substitution or variation pursuant to Condition 10
(Substitution and Variation), such certificate shall also include further certifications that the criteria specified in
paragraphs (a) to (e) of the definition of Qualifying Securities will be satisfied by the Qualifying Securities upon
issue and that such determinations were reached by the Issuer in consultation with an independent investment
bank of international repute, an independent financial adviser with appropriate expertise or independent counsel
of recognised standing;

(b) in the case of a Withholding Tax Event only, an opinion of independent legal advisers of recognised

standing to the effect that the Issuer or, as the case may be, the Guarantor has or will become obliged to pay
Additional Amounts (as defined in Condition 15 (Taxation)) on the Securities or, as the case may be, under the
Guarantee as a result of the relevant Tax Law Change; and

(c) in the case of a substitution or variation pursuant to Condition 10 (Substitution or Variation) only, an

opinion from independent legal advisers of recognised standing confirming:

(i) that the Issuer has capacity to assume all rights and obligations under the Qualifying Securities and has

obtained all necessary corporate or governmental authorisation to assume all such rights and obligations (either
as primary debtor or as a guarantor of a wholly-owned direct or indirect finance subsidiary of the Issuer that
assumes the role of primary debtor in respect of the Qualifying Securities) and, in the case of a wholly-owned


-----

direct or indirect finance subsidiary of the Issuer that assumes the role of primary debtor in respect of the
Qualifying Securities, that such finance subsidiary has capacity to assume all rights and obligations under the
Qualifying Securities and has obtained all necessary corporate or governmental authorisation to assume all such
rights and obligations; and

(ii) the legality, validity and enforceability of the Qualifying Securities,

and the Fiscal Agent may rely absolutely upon and shall be entitled to accept such certificate and any such
opinions without any liability to any person for so doing and without any further inquiry as sufficient evidence
of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set out in such paragraphs in which event it shall be conclusive
and binding on the Holders.

Any redemption of the Securities in accordance with Conditions 9(b), 9(c), 9(d), 9(e), 9(f), 9(g) or 9(h)
(Redemption) shall be conditional on all outstanding Arrears of Interest being paid in full in accordance with the
provisions of Condition 8 (Optional Interest Deferral) on or prior to the date thereof, together with any accrued
and unpaid interest up to (but excluding) such redemption, substitution or, as the case may be, variation date.

The Fiscal Agent is under no obligation to ascertain whether any Special Event or Change of Control Event or
Change of Control or any event which could lead to the occurrence of, or could constitute, any such Special
Event, Change of Control Event or Change of Control, has occurred and, until it shall have actual knowledge or
express notice pursuant to the Fiscal Agency Agreement to the contrary, the Fiscal Agent may assume that no
such Special Event, Change of Control Event or Change of Control or such other event has occurred.

the liquidation of the Issuer and/or the Guarantor, for such payment, and in the event of a winding up of the

which may become payable pursuant to the foregoing provisions or any undertakings given in addition thereto
or in substitution therefor pursuant to the Fiscal Agency Agreement.

**16** **Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer in respect of Securities will become void unless made within a period of 10 years (in
respect of claims relating to principal and premium) and five years (in respect of claims relating to interest) from
the Relevant Date relating thereto.

**17** **Meetings of Holders and Modification**

The Fiscal Agency Agreement contains provisions for convening meetings of the Holders to consider any matter
affecting their interests, including the sanctioning by Extraordinary Resolution of a modification of any of these
Conditions or any of the provisions of the Fiscal Agency Agreement. Such a meeting may be convened by the
Issuer or the Guarantor and shall be convened by the Issuer if required in writing by Holders holding not less
than ten per cent. in principal amount of the Securities for the time being remaining outstanding.

The quorum at any such meeting for passing an Extraordinary Resolution is one or more persons holding or
representing not less than 50 per cent. in principal amount of the Securities for the time being outstanding, or at
any adjourned meeting one or more persons being or representing Holders whatever the principal amount of the
Securities so held or represented, except that at any meeting the business of which includes the modification of


-----

certain provisions of the Securities (including, save where permitted by these Conditions or the Deed of
Guarantee, modifying any redemption date in relation to the Securities or reduction or cancellation of the
nominal amount payable upon redemption, a reduction or cancellation of the amount payable or modification of
the payment date in respect of any interest or the method of calculating the rate thereof, modification of the
Guarantee and modification of the currency in which payments under the Securities are to be made), the quorum
shall be one or more persons holding or representing not less than three-quarters in principal amount of the
Securities for the time being outstanding, or at any adjourned such meeting one or more persons holding or
representing not less than one-quarter in principal amount of the Securities for the time being outstanding.

The agreement or approval of the Holders shall not be required in the case of any variation of these Conditions
and/or the Fiscal Agency Agreement required to be made (i) in the circumstances described in Condition 10
(Substitution or Variation) in connection with the substitution or variation of the terms of the Securities so that
they become Qualifying Securities and (ii) in effecting any Benchmark Amendments in the circumstances and
as otherwise set out in Condition 7(j).

An Extraordinary Resolution passed at any meeting of the Holders shall be binding on all the Holders, whether
or not they are present at the meeting. The Fiscal Agency Agreement provides that a resolution in writing signed
by or on behalf of the Holders of not less than 75 per cent. in principal amount of the Securities outstanding or
consent given by Holders of not less than 75 per cent. in principal amount of the Securities by electronic consent
through the clearing systems shall for all purposes be as valid and effective as an Extraordinary Resolution
passed at a meeting of Holders duly convened and held. A resolution in writing may be contained in one
document or several documents in the same form, each signed by or on behalf of one or more Holders.

The Fiscal Agent and the Issuer may agree, without the consent of the Holders, to:

(a) any modification (except such modifications in respect of which an increased quorum is required as
mentioned above) of the Fiscal Agency Agreement which is not prejudicial to the interests of the
Holders; or

(b) any modification of the Securities or the Fiscal Agency Agreement which is of a formal, minor or
technical nature or is made to correct a manifest or proven error or to comply with mandatory
provisions of the law.

Any such modification shall be binding on the Holders and any such modification shall be notified to the
Holders in accordance with Condition 21 (Notices) as soon as practicable thereafter.

Prior to the making of any such modification or taking any action as aforementioned, or prior to any
substitution, termination or variation in a manner contemplated in Conditions 10 (Substitution or Variation), 18
(Substitution of Issuer) or 19 (Substitution of Guarantor and termination of Guarantee), the Issuer, the
Guarantor and the Fiscal Agent shall not be obliged to have regard to the tax position of individual Holders or to
the tax consequences of any such modification, substitution, variation, termination or other action for individual
Holders. No Holder shall be entitled to claim, whether from the Fiscal Agent, the Issuer, the Guarantor, a New
Issuer or any other person, any indemnification or payment in respect of any tax consequence of any such
modification, substitution, variation, termination or other action upon individual Holders.

**18** **Substitution of Issuer**

(a) The Issuer may at any time, without the consent of the Holders, substitute for itself as the principal
debtor under the Securities, the Guarantor or any other member of the Group or a successor in business
of the Issuer (such substitute, a New Issuer) provided that:

(i) a deed poll and such other documents (if any) shall be executed by the New Issuer and, to the
extent necessary, the other parties to the Fiscal Agency Agreement, as may be necessary to


-----

give full effect to the substitution and pursuant to which the New Issuer shall undertake in
favour of each Holder and each Accountholder (as defined in the Deed of Covenant) to be
bound by these conditions, the Deed of Covenant and the Fiscal Agency Agreement as
principal debtor in respect of the Securities in place of the Issuer;

(ii) each Rating Agency confirms that upon the substitution of the New Issuer becoming effective
the Securities will either have the same credit rating as immediately prior to the substitution or
the credit rating will not be adversely affected;

(iii) each Rating Agency has confirmed that upon such substitution becoming effective the
Securities will either still be eligible for the same, or a higher amount of, “equity credit” (or
such other nomenclature that the Rating Agency may then use to describe the degree to which
an instrument exhibits the characteristics of an ordinary share) as is attributed to the Securities
on the date immediately prior to such substitution or such eligibility or attribution will not be
adversely affected;

(iv) the Fiscal Agent shall have received legal opinions addressed to the Holders from legal
advisers of internationally recognised standing approved by it to the effect, inter alia, that (A)
the New Issuer has obtained all governmental and regulatory approvals and consents necessary
for its assumption of the obligations and liabilities as principal debtor under these Conditions,
the Deed of Covenant and the Fiscal Agency Agreement in place of the Issuer, the Holders
have rights against the New Issuer at least equivalent to the rights they have against the Issuer,
subject to the other Conditions in this Condition 18 having been satisfied such assumption is
fully effective and such obligations and liabilities are legally valid and binding on, and
enforceable against, the New Issuer; (B) such approvals and consents are in full force and
effect at the time of substitution; and (C) confirming, with respect to the New Issuer,
compliance with sub-paragraph (v) below;

(v) all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Securities by or on behalf of the New
Issuer shall be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for or on account
of any taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatsoever nature imposed,
levied, collected, withheld or assessed by or on behalf of the tax jurisdiction to which it is
subject or any political subdivision thereof or any authority thereof or therein having power to
tax;

(vi) any stock exchange on which the Securities are listed shall have confirmed to the Issuer and
the Fiscal Agent that, after giving effect to the substitution, the Securities will continue to be
listed on such stock exchange;

New Issuer is solvent at the time at which the substitution or appointment is proposed to be
effected; and

have certified to the Fiscal Agent that, following consultation with an independent investment
bank of international repute, an independent financial adviser with appropriate expertise or
independent counsel of recognised standing, the Issuer or, as the case may be, the New Issuer
has concluded that such substitution (i) will not result in the New Issuer having an entitlement,
as at the date such substitution becomes effective, to redeem the Securities as a result of a
Special Event and (ii) will not result in the terms of the Securities immediately following such
substitution being materially less favourable to holders than the terms of the Securities
immediately prior to such substitution.


-----

(b) Upon execution and delivery of the deed poll or the other documents referred to in paragraph (a)(i)
above and delivery of the legal opinions and other documents referred to in paragraph (a)(ii) to (a)(viii)
above the New Issuer shall be deemed to be named in the Securities, the Deed of Covenant and the
Fiscal Agency Agreement as the principal debtor in place of the Issuer and the Securities, the Deed of
Covenant, the Fiscal Agency Agreement and any other documents related to the Securities shall
thereupon be deemed to be amended to give effect to the substitution, and the Issuer shall be released
from all of its obligations under or in respect of the Securities, the Deed of Covenant, and the Fiscal
Agency Agreement and any other documents related to the Securities.

(c) Not later than 14 days after the substitution of a New Issuer, notice shall be given to the Holders in
accordance with Condition 21 (Notices).

(Subordination) shall be amended to the governing law of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the New
Issuer. In addition, for the purposes of the definition of “Compulsory Arrears of Interest Settlement
Event”, references to “Junior Obligations of the Issuer” shall be deemed to include references to such
obligations of both the New Issuer and SES S.A.

**19** **Substitution of Guarantor and termination of Guarantee**

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Condition 4 (The Guarantee) relating to the Guarantee being
unconditional and irrevocable, the Deed of Guarantee contains provisions which:

(i) allow the Guarantor at any time to substitute itself for another entity in the Group or a
successor in business of the Guarantor (upon which such other entity shall assume all the
rights and obligations of the Guarantor under these Conditions, the Fiscal Agency Agreement,
the Guarantee and any other related documents); and

(ii) for so long as SES Global Americas Holdings GP remains Guarantor, permit a termination of
the Guarantee.

(ii) in the case of a termination pursuant to this Condition 19 only, either:

(I) an order is made by any competent court or effective resolution passed for the
winding up or dissolution of SES Global Americas Holdings GP, and such winding
up or dissolution is for the purposes of or pursuant to an amalgamation,
reorganisation or restructuring while solvent and pursuant to which SES S.A. assumes
all of the assets, liabilities and obligations of SES Global Americas Holdings GP (and
any such termination pursuant to this Condition 19(b)(ii)(I) shall become effective
upon the relevant winding up or dissolution taking effect); or

(II)

effective the Securities will either have the same credit rating as immediately prior to such
substitution or termination or the credit rating will not be adversely affected; and

effective the Securities will either still be eligible for the same, or a higher amount of, “equity
credit” (or such other nomenclature that the Rating Agency may then use to describe the
degree to which an instrument exhibits the characteristics of an ordinary share) as is attributed
to the Securities on the date immediately prior to such substitution or termination or such
eligibility or attribution will not be adversely affected;

(v) in the case of a termination pursuant to this Condition 19 only, two Authorised Signatories of
the Issuer shall have certified to the Fiscal Agent that the requirements of this Condition 19
have been fulfilled prior to such termination taking effect (and such certificate signed by two
Authorised Signatories of the Issuer confirming that the requirements of this Condition 19
have been fulfilled shall, in the absence of manifest or proven error, be conclusive and
binding); and

(vi) two Authorised Signatories of the Issuer or two Authorised Signatories of the Guarantor shall
have certified to the Fiscal Agent that, following consultation with an independent investment
bank of international repute, an independent financial adviser with appropriate expertise or
independent counsel of recognised standing, the Issuer or, as the case may be, the Guarantor
has concluded that such substitution or termination (i) will not result in the Issuer having an
entitlement, as at the date such substitution or termination becomes effective, to redeem the
Securities as a result of a Special Event and (ii) in the case of a substitution pursuant to this
Condition 19 only, will not result in the terms of the Securities and the Guarantee (taken

than the terms of the Securities and the Guarantee (taken together) immediately prior to such
substitution.

regulations or other relevant regulatory authority regulations, at the specified office of the Registrar or such
other Paying Agent as may from time to time be designated by the Issuer for that purpose and notice of whose
designation is given to Holders, in each case on payment by the claimant of the fees and costs incurred in
connection therewith and on such terms as to evidence, security, indemnity and otherwise as the Issuer and the


-----

Fiscal Agent may require. Mutilated or defaced Certificates must be surrendered before replacements will be
issued.

**21** **Notices**

All notices to the Holders will be valid if mailed to them by first class mail or (if posted to an address overseas)
by airmail to the Holders (or the first of any joint named Holders) at their respective addresses in the Register
maintained by the Registrar. The Issuer shall also ensure that notices are duly published in a manner which
complies with the rules of any stock exchange or other relevant authority on which the Securities are for the
time being listed or by which they have been admitted to trading (which means, for the avoidance of doubt, if
and for so long as the Securities are admitted to trading on, and listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange and the rules of such stock exchange so require, a daily newspaper of general circulation in
Luxembourg, and/or on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s website (www.bourse.lu) or any other manner
considered as equivalent by the Luxembourg Stock Exchange). Any such notice will be deemed to have been
given on the fourth day after being so mailed or on the date of publication or, if published more than once, on
the first date on which such publication is made.

**22** **Further Issues**

The Issuer may from time to time without the consent of the Holders create and issue further Securities ranking
_pari passu in all respects (or in all respects save for the date from which interest thereon accrues and the amount_
of the first payment of interest on such further Securities) and so that such further issue shall be consolidated
and form a single series with the outstanding Securities.

**23** **Agents**

The initial Agents and their initial specified offices are listed below. The Issuer reserves the right at any time to
vary or terminate the appointment of any Agent and to appoint additional or other Agents, provided that it will:

(a) at all times maintain a Fiscal Agent and a Registrar; and

(b) whenever a function expressed in these Conditions to be performed by the Agent Bank or by the Reset
Reference Banks falls to be performed, appoint and (for so long as such function is required to be
performed) maintain an Agent Bank and/or, as appropriate, Reset Reference Banks.

Notice of any such termination or appointment and of any change in the specified offices of the Fiscal Agent,
the Registrar or any of the Paying Agents or Transfer Agents will be given to the Holders in accordance with
Condition 21 (Notices). If any of the Fiscal Agent, the Registrar, the Agent Bank or any Paying Agent is unable
or unwilling to act as such or if it fails to make a determination or calculation or otherwise fails to perform its
duties under these Conditions or the Fiscal Agency Agreement (as the case may be), the Issuer shall appoint, an
independent financial institution to act as such in its place. All calculations and determinations made by the
Agent Bank or the Fiscal Agent in relation to the Securities shall (save in the case of manifest error) be final and
binding on the Issuer, the Guarantor, the other Agents and the Holders.

**24** **Governing Law**

The Fiscal Agency Agreement, the Deed of Covenant, the Guarantee, the Securities and any non-contractual
obligations arising out of or in connection with them are governed by, and shall be construed in accordance
with, the laws of England save for the provisions contained in Condition 3(a) (Subordination) which shall,
subject to the provisions of Condition 18(d) (Substitution of Issuer) and Condition 19(f) (Substitution of
_Guarantor and termination of Guarantee), be governed by the laws of Luxembourg and the provisions_
contained in Condition 6(a) which shall be governed by the laws of Delaware. The provisions of articles 470-3


-----

to 470-19 (inclusive) of the Luxembourg law dated 10 August 1915 concerning commercial companies, as
amended, shall not apply to the Securities.

**25** **Submission to Jurisdiction**

The Issuer irrevocably agrees, for the benefit of the Holders, that the courts of England are to have exclusive
jurisdiction to settle any disputes which may arise out of or in connection with the Securities (including a
dispute relating to any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with the Fiscal Agency
Agreement and the Securities) and accordingly submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.

The Issuer waives any objection to the courts of England on the grounds that they are an inconvenient or
inappropriate forum. The Holders may take any suit, action or proceedings (together referred to as Proceedings)
arising out of or in connection with the Securities (including a dispute relating to any non-contractual
obligations arising out of or in connection with the Securities), against the Issuer in any other court of competent
jurisdiction and concurrent Proceedings in any number of jurisdictions.

**26** **Appointment of Process Agent**

The Issuer appoints Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP at its registered office at 100 Bishopsgate, London
EC2P 2SR (marked for the attention of the Dispute Resolution DMP and Mr. Christopher Barratt, reference
123182-0079) as its agent for service of process, and undertakes that, in the event of Freshfields Bruckhaus
Deringer LLP ceasing so to act or ceasing to be registered in England, it will appoint another person as its agent
for service of process in England in respect of any Proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect the right to serve
proceedings in any other manner permitted by law.

**27** **Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999**

No person shall have any right to enforce any term or condition of the Securities by virtue of the Contracts
(Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999, but this does not affect any right or remedy of any person which exists or is
available apart from that Act.

**28** **Definitions**

accounting principles (or the application thereof) which have been officially adopted by the International
Accounting Standards Board (or any other body responsible for IFRS or any other accounting standards that
may replace IFRS) after the Issue Date (such date of adoption being the Accounting Event Adoption Date), the
obligations of the Issuer under the Securities must not or may no longer be recorded as “equity” in the next
following audited annual consolidated financial statements of SES S.A. prepared in accordance with IFRS or

effective on or after the Issue Date (or, if later, effective after the date on which the Securities are assigned
“equity credit” by a Rating Agency for the first time) and as a result of which, but not otherwise, the Securities
will no longer be eligible (or if the Securities have been partially or fully refinanced since the Issue Date and are
no longer eligible for equity credit from such Rating Agency in part or in full as a result, any or all of the
Securities would no longer have been eligible as a result of such change had they not been refinanced) for the
same, or a higher amount of, “equity credit” (or such other nomenclature that the Rating Agency may then use
to describe the degree to which an instrument exhibits the characteristics of an ordinary share) as was attributed
to the Securities at the Issue Date (or if “equity credit” is not assigned to the Securities by the relevant Rating
Agency on the Issue Date, at the date on which “equity credit” is assigned by such Rating Agency for the first
time) or if the period of time during which the relevant Rating Agency attributes to the Securities a particular

any such Senior Obligations of the Issuer by any relevant Rating Agency shall be below an investment
grade rating (as described above), lowered one full rating category (for example from BB+ to BB or
such similar lower or equivalent rating), provided that a Rating Downgrade otherwise arising by virtue
of a particular change in rating shall be deemed not to have occurred in respect of a particular Change
of Control if the relevant Rating Agency making the change in rating to which this definition would
otherwise apply does not publicly announce or publicly confirm that the reduction was the result, in
whole or part, of any event or circumstance comprised in or arising as a result of, or in respect of, the
applicable Change of Control;

_to the extent that such part of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities (or any part thereof) to be_

_(vi)_ _such redemption or repurchase occurs on or after 27 August 2046._

-----

**THE GLOBAL CERTIFICATE**

The Global Certificate will contain provisions which apply to the Securities in respect of which they are
issued while they are represented by the Global Certificate, some of which modify the effect of the
Conditions and which are summarised below. Terms defined in the Conditions have the same meaning in
paragraphs 1 to 7 below.

**1.** **Accountholders**

For so long as any of the Securities are represented by the Global Certificate, each person (other than another
clearing system) who is for the time being shown in the records of Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg or
any other clearing system (an **_Alternative Clearing System) as the holder of a particular nominal amount of_**
such Securities (each an **_Accountholder) (in which regard any certificate or other document issued by_**
Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg or any Alternative Clearing System as to the aggregate principal
amount of such Securities standing to the account of any person shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes save in the case of manifest error) shall be treated as the holder of such nominal amount of such
Securities (and the expression Holders and references to holding of Securities and to holder of Securities shall
be construed accordingly) for all purposes other than with respect to payments on such Securities, the right to
which shall be vested, as against the Issuer and the Guarantor, solely in the registered holder of the Global
Certificate, being the nominee for the relevant clearing system (the Relevant Nominee), in accordance with and
subject to the terms of the Global Certificate and the Fiscal Agency Agreement. Each Accountholder must look
solely to Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, for its share of each payment made to
the Relevant Nominee.

**2.** **Redemption and Cancellation**

On any redemption or payment of interest being made in respect of, or purchase and cancellation of, any of the
Securities represented by the Global Certificate details of such redemption, payment or purchase and
cancellation (as the case may be) shall be entered by or on behalf of the Issuer in the Register. Upon any such
redemption, payment of an instalment or purchase and cancellation the nominal amount of the Global Certificate
and the Securities held by the registered holder hereof shall be reduced by the nominal amount of such
Securities so redeemed or purchased and cancelled. The nominal amount of the Global Certificate and of the
Securities held by the registered holder hereof following any such redemption or purchase and cancellation as
aforesaid or any transfer or exchange as referred to below shall be the nominal amount most recently entered in
the register.

**3.** **Payments**

Payments of principal, premium and interest (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Deferred Interest) in respect
of Securities represented by the Global Certificate will be made to the Relevant Nominee upon presentation or,
if no further payment falls to be made in respect of the Securities, against presentation and surrender of such
Global Certificate to or to the order of the Fiscal Agent or such other Paying Agent as shall have been notified to
the holders of the Global Certificate for such purpose. A record of each payment made will be entered into
by or on behalf of the Registrar in the Register and shall be prima facie evidence that payment has been made.

Distributions of amounts with respect to book-entry interests in the Securities held through Euroclear or
Clearstream, Luxembourg will be credited, to the extent received by the Fiscal Agent, to the cash accounts of
Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg participants in accordance with the relevant clearing system’s rules and
procedures.

For the purposes of Condition 13 (Payments), the record date in respect of the Securities shall be the close of the
business day (being for this purpose a day on which Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg are open for
business) before the relevant due date.

**4.** **Notices**

So long as the Securities are represented by the Global Certificate and the Global Certificate is held on behalf of
Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg or any Alternative Clearing System notices to Holders may be given by
delivery of the relevant notice to the relevant clearing system for communication by it to entitled
Accountholders in substitution for notification as required by Condition 21 (Notices) provided that the Issuer


-----

shall also ensure that notices are duly given or published in a manner which complies with the rules and
regulations of any stock exchange or other relevant authority on which the Securities are for the time being
listed. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given to the Holders on the day after the day on which
such notice is delivered to Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or any Alternative Clearing System (as the
case may be) as aforesaid.

**5.** **Exchange and Registration of Title**

Transfers of the holding of Securities represented by the Global Certificate pursuant to Condition 1(c) may only
be made in part:

(a) if the Securities represented by the Global Certificate are held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream,
Luxembourg or any Alternative Clearing System and any such clearing system is closed for business
for a continuous period of 14 days (other than by reason of holidays, statutory or otherwise) or
announces an intention permanently to cease business or does in fact do so; or

(b) the Issuer has or will become subject to adverse tax consequences which would not be suffered were
the Securities represented by the Global Certificate in definitive form; or

(c) upon an Enforcement Event,

provided that, in the case of the first transfer of part of a holding pursuant to (a) or (b) above, the holder of the
Securities represented by the Global Certificate has given the Registrar not less than 30 days’ notice at its
specified office of such holder’s intention to effect such transfer. Where the holding of Securities represented by
the Global Certificate is only transferable in its entirety, the Certificate issued to the transferee upon transfer of
such holding shall be a Global Certificate. Where transfers are permitted in part, Certificates issued to
transferees shall not be Global Certificates unless the transferee so requests and certifies to the Registrar that it
is, or is acting as a nominee for, Clearstream, Luxembourg, Euroclear and/or an Alternative Clearing System.

**6.** **Transfers**

Transfers of book-entry interests in the Securities will be effected through the records of Euroclear and
Clearstream, Luxembourg and their respective participants in accordance with the rules and procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg and their respective direct and indirect participants.

**7.** **Calculation of Interest**

For so long as all the Securities outstanding are represented by the Global Certificate, interest shall be calculated
on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities represented by the Global Certificate, and not
per Calculation Amount as provided in Condition 7(b) (Interest Payments - Interest Accrual).

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**Financial Data**

Unless otherwise indicated, financial information included in this Prospectus has been prepared in

accordance with IFRS.

The Group’s financial year ends on 31 December.

**Rounding**

Some financial information in this Prospectus has been rounded, and as a result the numbers shown as

totals may vary slightly from the exact arithmetical aggregation of the relevant figures.

**Currency Presentation**

In this Prospectus, references to “€,” “EUR” and “euro” are to the single currency of the participating

member states (Member States) in the Third Stage of European Economic and Monetary Union of the Treaty
Establishing the European Community, as amended from time to time. References to “U.S. dollars,” “U.S.$”
and “$” are to the United States dollar, the lawful currency of the United States of America.

**Alternative Performance Measures**

The Group presents certain financial measures which are not recognised by IFRS. These measures may

not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measurements under IFRS
or any other body of generally accepted accounting principles, and thus should not be considered substitutes for
the information contained in the Group’s financial statements.

Net debt, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, Operating

profit and Operating profit margin, Adjusted Net Debt, Adjusted Net Debt to EBITDA ratio, Adjusted Net Debt
to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, Adjusted Net Profit and Adjusted Earnings per Share and Free cash flow before
equity distributions and treasury activities of and for the year ended 31 December 2019 and 2020 are each
reconciled to the relevant statement of financial position and income statement line items from which they are
derived in Note 35 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for the year ended 31
December 2020, which are incorporated by reference in this Prospectus.

**_Net debt_**

Net debt is defined as current and non-current borrowings less cash and cash equivalents, all as

disclosed on the consolidated statement of financial position. SES believes that net debt is relevant to investors,
since it gives an indication of the absolute level of non-equity funding of the business. This can be compared to
the income and cash flows generated by the business, and available undrawn facilities.

**_EBITDA and EBITDA margin_**

EBITDA is defined as profit for the period before the impact of depreciation, amortisation, net

financing cost, income tax, the Group’s share of the results of joint ventures and associates and discontinued
operations and any extraordinary line item between revenue and profit before tax in the Group’s consolidated
income statement. EBITDA margin is defined as EBITDA divided by revenue. SES believes that EBITDA and
EBITDA margin are useful supplemental indicators that may be used to assist in evaluating a company’s
operating performance.

**_Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin_**

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted to exclude material exceptional items. In 2020 the

primary exceptional items are restructuring charges announced in the framework of the Group ‘Simplify and
Amplify’ programme, and the net impact of the C-band Repurposing (as defined below). Adjusted EBITDA
margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.


-----

**_Operating profit and operating profit margin_**

Operating profit is defined as profit for the period before the impact of net financing charges, income

tax, the Group’s share of the results of joint ventures and associates and discontinued operations and includes
any extraordinary line item between revenue and profit before tax in the Group’s consolidated income
statement. The Group uses operating profit to monitor its financial return after both operating expenses and a
charge representing the cost of usage of both its property, plant and equipment and definite-life intangible
assets.

Operating profit margin is defined as operating profit as a percentage of revenue. SES believes that

operating profit margin is a useful measure to demonstrate the proportion of revenue that has been realised as
operating profit, and therefore an indicator of profitability.

**_Adjusted Net Debt_**

Adjusted Net Debt is defined as current and non-current borrowings less cash and cash equivalents, all as

disclosed on the consolidated financial position and also includes 50 per cent. of the Group’s EUR 1.3 billion of the
perpetual bonds (consistent with rating agencies’ methodology). The Group believes that Adjusted Net Debt is
relevant to investors, since it gives an indication of the absolute level of non-equity funding of the business. This
can be compared to the income and cash flows generated by the business, and available undrawn facilities.

**_Adjusted Net Debt to EBITDA ratio_**

Adjusted Net Debt to EBITDA ratio is defined as Adjusted Net Debt, as described above, divided by

EBITDA. The Group believes that Adjusted Net Debt to EBITDA ratio is a useful measure to demonstrate to
investors its ability to generate the income needed to be able to settle its loans and borrowings as they fall due.

**_Adjusted Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio_**

The Adjusted Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio is defined as Adjusted Net Debt divided by

Adjusted EBITDA. The Group believes that the Adjusted Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio is a useful
measure to demonstrate to investors its ability to generate the recurring income needed to be able to settle its
loans and borrowings as they fall due.

**_Adjusted Net Profit and Adjusted Earnings per Share_**

Adjusted Net Profit is defined as profit or loss of the period attributable to shareholders of the group

adjusted to exclude the after-tax impact of material exceptional items of the period. In 2020 the primary
exceptional items are restructuring charges announced in the framework of the Group’s ‘Simplify and Amplify’
programme, the net impact of the C-band Repurposing (as defined below) and impairment expenses. The tax
rate applied to the pre-tax impact of the C-band operating expenses is the US tax rate and the tax rate applied to
the restructuring expenses and impairment expenses represents the computed weighted average tax rate of the
jurisdictions where the expenses occurred.

Adjusted Earnings per Share is the reported earnings per share adjusted for the after-tax impact of

material exceptional items as described above.

**_Free cash flow before equity distributions and treasury activities_**

Free cash flow before financing activities is defined as net cash generated by operating activities,

adjusted for the net cash absorbed by investing activities. In addition, free cash flow before equity distributions
and treasury activities considers the effect of the interest paid on borrowings and lease payments on the
computed free cash flow before financing activities. The Group believes that the free cash flow before equity
distributions and treasury activities is relevant to the investors, since it gives an indication of the Group’s ability
to generate cash after payment of taxes and other committed financing charges.

**Constant FX presentation**


-----

To assist investors in isolating the impact of exchange rates on its results and therefore improve the

comparability of its financial information, the Group reports changes in its operating results on a constant
currency (constant FX) basis. To do this, the Group reconsolidates figures on a month-by-month basis by
applying the exchange rate used for a given month from the current year to the corresponding month in the prior
year. For example, January 2019 financial information would be reconsolidated using the January 2020
exchange rate.

The measures presented on a constant currency basis should not be considered in isolation or as an

alternative to the measures presented on a reported basis on the Group’s income statement or the notes thereto
and should not be construed as a representation that the relevant currency could be or was converted into euro at
that rate or at any other rate.

**_Constant FX Adjustments: 12-month period ended 31 December 2020_**

The following table shows revenue for each of the Group’s verticals for the 12-month periods ended 31

December 2019 and 2020. The figures for the 12-month period ended 31 December 2019 are provided as
reported and on a constant FX basis calculated in the manner described above. It also shows growth between the
two periods on a reported basis and on a constant FX basis.

**Underlying and Periodic Revenue**

“Underlying” revenue represents the core business of capacity sales, as well as associated services and

equipment. This is impacted by changes in launch schedule and satellite health status. For the years ended 31
December 2018, 2019 and 2020 underlying reported revenue for Video was €1,292.1 million, €1,210.0 million
and €1,108.1 million respectively and for Networks was, €671.1 million, €734.1 million and €758.7 million
respectively.[8]

“Periodic” revenue separates revenues that are not directly related to or would distort the underlying

business trends. This includes: the outright sale of capacity; accelerated revenue from hosted payloads during
the course of construction; termination fees; insurance proceeds; certain interim satellite missions and other such
items when material. For the years ended 31 December 2018, 2019 and 2020 periodic revenue for Video was
[€14.2 million, €3.4](http://dl.bourse.lu/dlp/105431e72b79de4e5893f530d6c7aa521b) million and €nil million respectively and for Networks was €24.6 million, €27.9 million and
€8 million respectively.

SES believes that demonstrating the split between “underlying” and periodic” revenue is a helpful

indicator to investors given the periodic revenues can distort the underlying business trends.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

SES has a bold vision to deliver amazing experiences everywhere on earth by distributing the highest

quality video content and providing seamless connectivity around the world. SES operates the world’s only
multi-orbit constellation of satellites with the unique combination of global coverage and high performance,
including the commercially-proven, low-latency Medium Earth Orbit O3b system. By leveraging a vast and
intelligent, cloud-enabled network, SES is able to deliver high-quality connectivity solutions anywhere on land,
at sea or in the air and is a trusted partner to the world’s leading telecommunications companies, mobile network
operators, governments, connectivity and cloud service providers, broadcasters, video platform operators and
content owners. SES’s video network carries over 8,200 channels and has an unparalleled reach of 361 million
households, delivering managed media services for both linear and non-linear content. The company is listed on
Paris and Luxembourg stock exchanges.

SES believes that the Group benefits from the following key strengths:

**_A satellite–embedded solution provider with global reach. SES is a global satellite operator, based on_**
operating a fleet of 52 GEO satellites and 20 MEO satellites serving markets around the world. Its
business supports a range of applications, foremost of which is the transmission of DTH television
broadcasts, a high-value application with persistent characteristics. SES also provides connectivity and
cloud services, including very small aperture terminal (VSAT) networks, broadband internet access and
mobile backhaul, to enterprises, institutions and governments.

**_Strong and predictable cash flows. The Group had a contract backlog of approximately €5.6 billion as_**
of 31 December 2020 delivered by a strong customer base consisting predominantly of broadcasters in
developed markets. This customer profile generates a predictable, high-margin revenue stream,
resulting in a strong cash flow conversion factor.

**_Clear and consistent financial strategy. The Group is committed to maintaining balance sheet metrics_**
consistent with investment grade credit rating. This has facilitated access on favourable terms to the
capital markets. While the Group has adequate liquidity at hand as of the date of this Prospectus, it
continues to seek to diversify and extend its debt funding base and to optimise its debt maturity profile.

**_Experienced management team. SES has a highly experienced management team, led by the_**
Executive Committee, each of whose members combine decades of experience in a wide variety of
disciplines.

**_Unique access to spectrum. SES has a unique access to multiple frequencies (C-, Ku- and Ka-band)_**
globally, including the entire equatorial MEO Ka-band spectrum.

**Strategic Priorities**

The Group aims to deliver sustained and profitable growth by building on the Group’s core

competencies and pursuing the following strategic priorities:


-----

  - reinforce and drive value through SES’s core video neighbourhoods;

  - develop OTT and orchestration capabilities to support SES’s video customers in reaching new markets
and audiences;

  - take advantage of opportunities to maximise efficiency and create value in video;

  - leverage SES’s market position in delivering unique high throughput, low latency GEO-MEO solutions
with end-to-end managed solutions, driving business growth in networks;

  - enable cloud adoption on a global scale, through partners and customers; and

  - harness emerging trends and technologies such as 5G, industrial ‘Internet of Things’, analytics and
cloud to integrate fully within the broader network ecosystem, making satellite mainstream.

In 2021 the launch of SES-17 is scheduled with Thales Alenia Space (Thales) committing to a long
term commercial agreement for service over the Americas and Atlantic Ocean.

In September 2017, SES Networks announced the launch of O3b mPOWER which will be the most

powerful, flexible and scalable satellite-based system launched by SES. O3b mPOWER will combine innovative
space and ground technology advancements, as well as software intelligence and will enable SES Networks to
deliver fully managed services to meet exponentially accelerating demand in the dynamic fixed data, mobility
and government markets. The investment also unlocks important capital efficiencies from SES’s unique GEOMEO network architecture with synergies equivalent to two replacement GEO satellites.

As part of the O3b mPOWER ecosystem, SES has contracted Boeing Satellite Systems to build a total

of 11 super-powered MEO satellites. Of these 11 satellites, the first 7 were ordered in 2017, while in 2020, SES
has augmented the constellation by ordering an additional 4. In September 2019, SES decided to appoint
SpaceX as launcher for its initial 7 O3b mPOWER satellites and in August 2020, SpaceX was also contracted to
launch the additional 4 satellites ordered. The first 3 satellites are scheduled for launch in 2021, the second and
third batches (of 3 satellites each) in 2022 and the final batch (of 2 satellites) in 2024.

The O3b mPOWER constellation will deliver unrivalled cloud-scale connectivity and managed services
globally, offering:

unique levels of flexibility with 5000 fully-shapeable and steerable beams per satellite that can be shifted and
switched in real time, making O3b mPOWER the most bandwidth-efficient system;

  - unrivalled coverage of an area of nearly 400 million square kilometres, representing 80 per cent. of the
Earth’s surface;

  - highest performance based on the combination of multiple terabits of throughput and low latency,
which will be seamlessly integrated with SES Networks existing GEO-MEO and terrestrial
capabilities; and

  - improved economics with lower cost-per-bit and cheaper ground equipment, including small, fast and
easy-to-install O3b mPOWER Customer Edge Terminals.

**History**

SES was founded in 1985 as Europe’s first private satellite operator, originally under the name of

Société Européenne des Satellites. The Group’s first satellite, ASTRA 1A, was launched in December 1988 for
broadcasting in Western Europe with transmission beginning in February 1989. The satellite had 16
transponders, most of which targeted specific markets in the United Kingdom, Scandinavia and Germany. By
the end of 1990, ASTRA 1A was able to reach over 16 million cable and DTH households in Europe. The


-----

launch of ASTRA 1A was followed by the launches of the ASTRA 1B, ASTRA 1C and ASTRA 1D satellites to
meet increasing demand, in 1991, 1993 and 1994, respectively. SES developed and pioneered satellite colocation during this period, as these satellites shared the same orbital slot (19.2ºE) as ASTRA 1A. This was a
first in the industry and substantially increased the number of channels that could be transmitted from that
orbital position.

In the years that followed, the Group reached further milestones, including the inauguration of its

digital technical facilities for the reception, monitoring, multiplexing, encryption and uplinking of hundreds of
digital channels on the ASTRA system, the launching of further satellites and the expansion of its footprint
across Europe.

In 1998, SES became a publicly listed company through an initial public offering and listing on the

Luxembourg Stock Exchange. In 1999, the Group began its transition from a single-market business to a global
operator through a strategy of acquiring minority interests in regional operators, such as Asian operator AsiaSat,
Nordic operator NSAB, and Brazilian operator Star One.

In 1998, SES opened a second orbital location for Europe at 28.2ºE with the launch of ASTRA 2A in

August 1998. This satellite mainly served the DTH markets in the United Kingdom and Ireland.

In 2001, SES acquired a 100 per cent. interest in General Electric’s (GE) satellite communications unit

- American Communications, for a consideration in cash and shares, following which GE became a significant
shareholder in SES. This formed SES AMERICOM and the acquisition included 13 satellites serving the North
American market, as well as six other satellites covering Asia, Latin American and certain Oceanic regions. The
transaction also included a U.S. government services unit that formed the basis of what is today SES
Government Solutions (SES GS).

In 2003, the Group created a strategic partnership that linked SES AMERICOM (North America’s

largest satellite operator at the time) with EchoStar (the U.S.’s second-largest DTH network) by which the
Group procures satellites and then fully contracts the capacity of the satellites to EchoStar.

In May 2004, SES’s securities were listed on the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange in order to further

facilitate trading in SES’s securities.

Also in 2004, SES acquired DPC from the Kirch Group. Renamed SES Platform Services, this entity

provided broadcasters with playout, multiplexing and encrypted satellite uplinks as well as other media
broadcast services.

In 2006, SES extended its footprint to deliver global coverage through the acquisition of New Skies

Satellites, a Dutch operator, and through this created SES New Skies. This acquisition gave the Group global
coverage that was based on 100 per cent.-owned satellites, thereby shifting its strategy away from minority
interests such as AsiaSat and Star One. In a €1.2 billion spin-off transaction in 2007, these and certain other
assets and cash were contributed to GE in exchange for its remaining shareholding in the Group, shares which
were then cancelled. SES New Skies and SES AMERICOM were later merged in 2009 to create SES World
Skies, which was merged into SES S.A. in 2011.

In 2008, the Group began using a new orbital position, 31.5ºE, to serve markets in Eastern Europe.

Operations were initiated with the Sirius 2 satellite, renamed ASTRA 5A. Following its retirement from service,
operations subsequently continued on ASTRA 2C and then ASTRA 1G. ASTRA 5B was launched on 22 March
2014 and currently operates at 31.5ºE.

In 2009, SES continued to expand despite the global economic downturn, with robust demand for

capacity in its developing markets. In particular, the Group entered into a partnership with Star Satellite


-----

Communications Company PJSC (YahSat) to offer DTH television in the Middle East and North Africa. The
Group also announced its strategic investment in O3b.

Also in 2009, SES launched HD+, a B2C German HD platform, offering viewers more than 50

channels in HD quality, including 23 of the largest commercial broadcasters in Germany.

In 2011, SES announced its new operating model that brought the market facing entities, SES ASTRA

and SES WORLD SKIES, under a streamlined management structure and consolidated its activities.

In 2012, the Group expanded its fleet through the launch of three new satellites, SES-4, SES-5 and

ASTRA 2F. The ASTRA satellite system is still deeply rooted in Europe where it continues to provide satellite
services to 37 countries in its geographic footprint coverage.

In 2013, the Group broadcasted its first Ultra HD Demo Channel, and launched three new satellites,

SES-6, SES-8, and ASTRA 2E. Each of these satellites were targeted to particular customer uses including key
video and mobility services over the Americas, service to the Asia-Pacific region, and extended service
capabilities to Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

With the launch of SES-8 in 2013 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the first commercial launch of the

rocket, the Group began what has since become a beneficial partnership with SpaceX to pioneer in new areas of
rocket launching, thereby expanding access to space by pursuing lower launch costs.

In 2016, SES announced that SES Platform Services would merge with RR Media to form MX1. In

July 2016, SES completed the merger of RR Media with SES Platform Services. The combination of these two
complementary businesses created what SES believes is a leading media solutions provider, enhancing and
expanding SES’s capabilities to deliver and monetise a range of video services across both linear and non-linear
platforms. MX1 provides a global network and cloud-based technologies to deliver a full suite of innovative
digital video and media end-to-end solutions. Later in 2019, MX1 services activities were fully merged into SES
Video distribution business activities to deliver every aspect of video content to customers around the globe out
of one hand.

On 1 August 2016, SES acquired 100 per cent. of O3b through the exercise of a call option, later

creating the SES Networks business unit in 2017 through this transaction. In connection with the acquisition of
O3b, on 31 May 2016 SES raised gross proceeds of €908.8 million through an issuance of 39,857,600 new
fiduciary depositary receipts placed with institutional investors and the issuance of 19,928,800 B shares of SES
to existing B shareholders (the Capital Raise) and carried out two issuances of Deeply Subordinated Fixed Rate
Resettable Securities, in aggregate of €1.3 billion, which settled on 10 June 2016 and 29 November 2016 (the
**_Hybrid Issuances)._**

In March 2017, SES pioneered reusable technology when SES-10 was launched by SpaceX on a

Falcon 9 flight-proven rocket. SES-10 went operational on 15 May 2017 at 67⁰ West and now serves what SES
believes to be thriving markets in the Latin Americas region.

In April 2017, the Board of SES approved a restructuring of SES’s go-to-market organisation model

with the creation of two highly focused business units – SES Video and SES Networks. The new organisation
model, which started to be implemented in May 2017, allows SES to deliver increasingly differentiated and
essential satellite-enabled communication solutions to customers in the video and data-centric verticals.

On 18 May 2017, the SES-15 satellite was launched on board a Soyuz launch vehicle from the Guiana

Space Center in Kourou, French Guiana. SES-15 marks the entry of the first of three planned hybrid satellites,
(SES HTS fleet later enhanced by ordering SES-17 as 4[th] HTS satellite), which have both wide beam and high
throughput (HTS) capabilities. SES-15 carries a hybrid payload, comprising Ku-band wide beams and Ku-band
HTS capability, with connectivity to gateways in Ka-band. On 15 January 2018, SES announced that the new


-----

SES-15 spacecraft had become operational at the 129⁰ West orbital position on 1 January 2018. As planned, the
all-electric satellite took six months to reach its orbital position and complete its testing.

On 11 October 2017, SES-11 was launched to support the continued development of the U.S. orbital

arc media distribution neighborhood and to provide coverage over North America, including Hawaii, Mexico
and the Caribbean. The spacecraft’s Ku-band capacity will replace AMC-15 at 105° West, an orbital position
where EchoStar has been an anchor customer since 2006. The spacecraft’s C-band capacity will provide
replacement capacity for AMC-18 at the same position. On 29 November 2017 SES announced that the SES-11
satellite was fully operational.

On 26 January 2018, SES-14 was launched to replace NSS-806 and support SES’s cable

neighbourhood in Latin America, the Caribbean, and across the North Atlantic. SES-14 also carried the GlobalScale Observations of the Limb and Disk (GOLD) as a hosted payload for NASA.

On 31 January 2018, GovSat-l, a brand operated by LuxGovSat S.A., a public-private joint venture

between the Luxembourg Government and SES, launched its first satellite (GovSat-1). Its mission is to provide
secure, reliable and accessible satellite communication services for governments, addressing connectivity
demands for defence and institutional security applications. GovSat-1 will be a multi-mission satellite that will
use X-band and military Ka-band frequencies on high-power and fully steerable mission beams to support
multiple operations.

On 8 March 2018, SES launched four O3b satellites. These additional MEO satellites augmented SES’s

existing O3b constellation of 12 satellites to deliver low latency, fibre-like connectivity to people and businesses
in the growing mobility, fixed data and government markets.

On 4 June 2018, SES launched SES-12 to replace NSS-6 and expand SES’s capabilities to provide

DTH broadcasting, VSAT, Mobility and High Throughput Satellite (HTS) data connectivity services in the
Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region, including rapidly growing markets such as India and Indonesia. The
satellite was co-located with SES-8 and is capable of supporting requirements in multiple verticals from Cyprus
in the West to Japan in the East, and from Russia in the North to Australia in the South.

On 27 September 2018, the C-band Alliance (CBA) was established by Intelsat, SES, Eutelsat and

Telesat to implement the safe and efficient clearing and repurposing of C-band spectrum, supporting the United
States in its goal of leadership in 5G deployment and innovation. While implementing the breakthrough, marketbased proposal to clear spectrum, the CBA will also protect the quality and reliability of existing C-band
services, providing current users certainty and operational integrity.

At the end of February 2019, SES-12 started to operate at 95° East, co-located with SES-8, and is

relying on its combination of wide-beam and HTS capacities to deliver new services over the Asia-Pacific
region.

In April 2019, the final four O3b satellites (satellites 17-20) were launched, completing the first

generation of SES’s successful and unique MEO constellation. The four additional satellites entered operation in
the second half of 2019, enhancing coverage across the globe and enabling SES Networks to provide greater
service availability and reliability.

In September 2019, SES became a Microsoft Azure Express Route services partner to provide

dedicated, private network connectivity from sea vessels, aircraft, and industrial or government sites anywhere
in the world to the Azure cloud computing service, via both its geostationary and O3b MEO medium Earth orbit
satellites.

**Recent Developments**


-----

In August 2020, SES expanded the O3b mPOWER constellation ordered in 2017 from 7 to 11 satellites

by contracting for an additional 4 satellites from Boeing. In addition, SpaceX was contracted to launch these
additional 4 satellites. With this augmentation, all 11 mPOWER satellites will be launched on board a SpaceX
launch vehicle between Q4 2021 and 2024.

In September 2020, SES and Microsoft announced that SES is MEO connectivity partner for the

[Microsoft Azure Orbital ground station service that enables network operators to control their satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure)
[operations and capacity from within the Azure cloud computing service.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing)

On 1 April 2021, shareholders approved all annual general meeting resolutions.

On 6 May 2021, SES announced a EUR 100 million share buyback programme.

_C-band repurposing developments_

On 28 February 2020, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted a Report and

Order of Proposed Modification in connection with the repurposing of 280 MHz of C-band spectrum to support
deployment of terrestrial 5G services in the contiguous United States (the **_C-band Repurposing). This decision_**
represented a milestone in clearing 280 megahertz of C-Band spectrum and in doing so protecting the 120
million US households and critical broadcast customers and communities that fully use the C-band today. The
Order created a mechanism to provide the Group with an option to clear the spectrum on an accelerated timeline
in exchange for accelerated relocation payments of up to $4 billion.

In May 2020 SES officially committed to the accelerated C-band clearing programme created by the

FCC, resulting in an opportunity for SES to realise up to $4 billion of pre-tax proceeds in the form of the
accelerated relocation payments. The SES Board of Directors approved the procurement program and launch of
new satellites, equipment and services for the migration of existing customers using the spectrum, which will be
reimbursable through the FCC Clearinghouse.

In June 2020, SES announced that four new C-band satellites had been ordered from US manufacturers

[Boeing (SES-20 and SES-21) and Northrop Grumman (SES-18 and SES-19) to fulfil the requirements of the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Satellite_Development_Center)
accelerated clearing programme. In addition, Thales Alenia Space has been contracted for the provision of two
contingency satellites.

In August 2020, the launch vehicle providers for the four new C-band satellites were announced, with

two satellites being launched by United Launch Alliance (Atlas rocket) and two by SpaceX (Falcon 9 rocket).

For more information on the financial impact of the C-band Repurposing, please see note 33 to the

consolidated financial statements for SES for the year ended 31 December 2020, which are incorporated by
reference in this Prospectus.

_COVID-19_

With the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, it became fundamental to effectively enact procedures

and measures to adequately respond to the substantial health risks and to secure business continuity under the
pandemic situation. SES activated pandemic plans with measures to protect the health and safety of staff and to
continue its operational business. SES instituted a Work from Home policy to allow the majority of employees
to safely work remotely where necessary. Some teams continue to work onsite under dedicated safety rules to
deliver uninterrupted service to SES customers.

Even before the first lock-down in March 2020, SES had created an internal global cross-functional COVID-19
Taskforce to ensure the health and safety of our staff and maintain business continuity. The team has enacted
health & safety measures and regularly updates staff on important considerations including support services
offered by SES, office access, working from home, travel restrictions, and tax implications for cross-border


-----

workers. Additionally, the taskforce continues to track all COVID cases and organised regular surveys as a
pulse check on everyone’s energy and engagement levels and general well-being.

The continuing pandemic has had, and continues to have, widespread economic implications across nearly all
economic sectors, including that of the Group, and management continues to monitor carefully the impact on
different aspects of the Group’s financial performance and to respond accordingly to protect the financial
interests of the Group.

In terms of impact on the satellite industry, while the generally fixed nature of the contracts and the critical
nature of connectivity services has underpinned its relative resilience, it has not been immune to the economic
challenges caused by the outbreak of the COVID-19 global pandemic.

Overall, COVID-19 is having a pronounced short and medium-term impact on the business of the Group,
significantly challenging the contract base, renewals and dampening growth across the Mobility, Energy and
Government segments, as well as stretching cash flows across much of the industry, and accelerating a
restructuring / consolidation process in some parts of the sectors the Group serves.

The overall revenue decrease versus the prior year which can be directly attributed to COVID-19 was -€31
million (Video -€17 million, Networks -€14 million).

In the Group’s most recent business planning exercise, whilst it is assumed that COVID-19 will continue to
affect the Group’s customers, and hence the Group’s business performance throughout 2021, management’s
expectation was that the residual impact on 2022 and beyond will not be significant, though it is not currently
possible to predict the full impact of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis with a high degree of certainty.

Primarily because of the pandemic, both NSR and Euroconsult expect the satellite industry to take 2-3 years to
return to the overall revenue levels of 2019 after which, they expect the market to expand rapidly over the
period between 2023 and 2029 due to the exponentially growing demand for reliable, high performance
connectivity across the Government, Fixed Data and Mobility segments.

For more information on the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Group, please see note 32 to
the consolidated financial statements for SES for the year ended 31 December 2020, which are incorporated by
reference in this Prospectus.

**SES Video**

SES Video delivers high-quality media content to 361 million households worldwide across 40 video

neighbourhoods. As of 31 December 2020, the SES fleet distributes over 8,265 TV channels to global audiences
including nearly 2,981 High Definition (HD) and Ultra HD (UHD) TV channels. Globally, this is done via
Direct-to-Home (DTH) platforms, Direct-to-Cable (DTC) neighbourhoods, digital terrestrial, and Internet
Protocol Television (IPTV) networks.

SES Video delivers a full suite of innovative end-to-end value-added services for both linear and non
linear distribution on premises software and now via Cloud. Every day, SES Video manages playout for more
than 525 channels, and delivers more than 8,400 hours of online video streaming, including over 620 hours of
premium sports and live events.

Those connectivity solutions and services are delivered to a broad range of global customers. Key

customers include Sky, Dish, Canal+, BBC, Pro7 Group, ARD, ZDF IMG, Telefonica, Amazon, Discovery,
Disney, Fox and Turner.

For the year ended 31 December 2020, SES Video generated revenue of EUR 1,108 million.

Underlying revenue of EUR 1,108 million was 8.0 per cent. lower, at constant FX, than the previous year.


-----

_Video Distribution - In Europe, volume reductions on some long-term renewals secured in late 2019_

led to lower year-on-year revenue (-7.8 per cent.), albeit utilisation rates across our industry-leading European
Video neighbourhoods remained strong.

North American revenue was impacted by ‘right-sizing’ of volume across US cable neighbourhoods

and accommodation of customers ahead of C-band clearing, as well as the expected reduction in the wholesale
business.

In the International markets, the contribution of new revenue secured is yet to fully offset the impact of

challenging trading environments.

_Video Services - The decision to reduce exposure to low margin services activities associated with the_

former MX1 business, and postponement or cancellation of sports and events in 2020 due to COVID-19, led to
lower year-on-year revenue (-8.7 per cent.).

HD+ was flat (year-on-year) with a shift towards TV-installed software solutions, reflecting the strong

partnerships with TV set manufacturers. Continued growth in the number of paying subscribers, which
improved during 2020, and the positive contribution from the planned increase in the cost to renew a 12-month
subscription from March 2021 is expected to support the future development of the platform.

Leveraging the experience and success of the HD+ business in Germany, SES launched, in late 2020,

an equivalent consumer platform in Ghana which offers access to premium HD content to audiences in a market
where over 4 million households are already being served by SES.

**SES Networks**

SES Networks provides managed global connectivity and data service solutions for a wide range of

fixed and mobile applications. By combining a global GEO / MEO network and end-to-end solutions capability,
SES Networks enables major Government, Fixed Data (Telco, MNO and Cloud) and Mobility (Aeronautical
and Maritime) customers to extend their network reach across the entire world. SES is the first, and only,
satellite operator to have been certified with the Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) 2.0 standard, used to rate the
latency of terrestrial networks. By adopting these practices and standards of the terrestrial network system, SES
is making it easier for customers to integrate satellite-based networks into a global ecosystem. This also includes
the integration of software-defined networking (SDN) capabilities and the flexibility and control that come with
it opening new opportunities such as the optimisation of the traffic between MEO or GEO over an intelligent
multi-orbit network. Further, SES is working with Amdocs to host an Open Networking Automation Platform
(ONAP) within a Microsoft Azure domain. This is a first for the satellite industry leveraging standards
developed within the Telco and Cloud industries to bring the same automation and programmability to Satellite.

Network customers vary depending on the data application. For mobility applications, customer

examples are Thales, Panasonic, Gogo, Global Eagle. In contrast, in the cruise industry, SES directly partners
with the cruise companies including Carnival, Royal Carribean, Genting, MSC. Examples of government
customers are the Luxembourg State, US DoD, NASA, ESA, Hughes. Besides, SES Telco customer examples
are Orange, Teleglobal and Telefonica. In the Cloud segment, SES has established a foundational partnership
with Microsoft as part of the Group’s ‘cloud-first’ approach.

For the year ended 31 December 2020, SES Networks generated revenue of EUR 767 million including

periodic revenue of EUR 8 million. Underlying revenue of EUR 759 million was 5.3 per cent. higher than the
prior year.

In the Government vertical, 2020 underlying revenue grew by 1.7 per cent. (year-on-year) at constant

FX due to strong contributions from new business in both the US Government and Global Government
businesses. US Government revenue was ahead (year-on-year) benefiting from the contribution of new MEO
and GEO-enabled network solutions. Global Government revenue was lower than in 2019, but improved
revenue run-rate offset this owing to the completion of certain milestone-driven institutional projects which
benefited 2019.


-----

_Fixed Data - Positive outturns across the Americas, Africa and Asia as well as from new business in_

energy and cloud, more than offset lower revenue in Europe and the Pacific and contributed to overall growth
(+6.7 per cent. year-on-year) in Fixed Data. Growth in the Americas was supported by new and incremental
managed services to tier one telecommunications companies, Mobile Networks Operators deploying 4G
networks and, government funded rural WiFi projects on behalf of SES’ customers, notably using SES-12 and
MEO-enabled high throughput capabilities.

_Mobility – Overall +9.0 per cent. growth (year-on-year). High single-digit growth in Aeronautical_

reflected the full year contribution of new business signed with several service providers during 2019. Similarly,
in Maritime, the full revenue contribution of expanded services with key cruise customers signed in 2019 and a
good trajectory in commercial shipping over the last 12 months led to double-digit growth in revenue.

As the vast majority of SES’ commercial contracts, including in Mobility, are long-term, the

performance was resilient to the impact of COVID-19 on customers and end markets served by SES in the
Cruise and Commercial Aviation segments. Nevertheless, it is expected that the development of both existing
revenue and pace of new business will continue to be impacted by COVID-19 in the near term.

**Industry Overview and Trends**

**_Overview_**

SES operates in the Satellite Communications (SatCom) sector of the space industry, which forms an

integral part of the global communications infrastructure. According to NSR, revenue of satellite operators
reached $13.7 billion in 2019 (Source: Satellite Industry Financial Analysis (10th Edition) - NSR December
2020).

Over the last several years, deregulation and privatisation have significantly reshaped the SatCom

sector. In addition, the sector has seen an increase in export financing from countries such as China, France and
the U.S. that has contributed to the development of national satellite programmes. The sector has also undergone
consolidation, with regional and national operators being acquired by larger companies or seeking to partner
with other providers.

There are currently three satellite operators in addition to SES that provide services globally. This is

increasingly important as broadcasters, enterprises and governments seek global connectivity. The number of
satellite operators having invested in HTS capacity has grown to 35 by 2020 (Source: Euroconsult, High
Throughput Satellites, March 2020). In addition, there are a number of operators with fewer satellites that
provide regional and/or national services.

Additionally, a number of high-throughput Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations are being developed and
launched. These new entrants are further adding to the supply available and have the potential to re-shape the
structure and increase the competitiveness of the sector.

**_Satellite Communication_**

Satellite operators compete with terrestrial (fixed and wireless) network operators (e.g., cable, DSL,

fibre optic, microwave broadcasting and 3G/4G/5G networks) in the market for video, data and voice
communication services. Satellite services have several advantages over these competing communication
platforms, such as:

- the ability to extend beyond terrestrial network end points, or provide an alternative path to terrestrial
infrastructure, thus avoiding points of congestion or unreliability;

- cost-effectiveness and efficiency in content distribution through the ability to broadcast high-quality
signals (TV, radio and internet) from a single location to many locations simultaneously;


-----

- fast network deployments, with network performance easily replicated across each site regardless of
geography or infrastructure, and efficient centralised control and management;

- the ability to provide ubiquitous coverage over a large geographic region allowing for the addition of
sites at a lower marginal cost. Unlike cable and fibre lines, satellites can readily provide broadcast and
communication services over large areas and to remote locations where the population density may not
be high enough to warrant the expense of building a terrestrial-based communications network;

- the ability to reach mobile sites that cannot be connected by terrestrial means;

- superior end-to-end network availability compared to terrestrial networks;

- sufficient bandwidth to support the introduction of new technologies and video and data offerings, such
as HD and UHD television; and

- rapid communications capabilities for disaster recovery.

Terrestrial alternatives, such as fibre optic cable, may be more advantageous than satellite in some

circumstances and can be used in conjunction with satellite to provide a hybrid network that takes advantage of
the inherent abilities of both technologies. Generally, in densely populated areas well served by terrestrial
networks or for point-to-point communications, terrestrial alternatives may have a cost advantage, while in
remote areas or for point-to-multi-point communications satellite may be the more efficient solution.

In recent years, the growth in both linear and non-linear TV viewing and the demand for the delivery of

broadcast and broadband networks to subscribers through a single user interface have led to the development of
Hybrid Terrestrial-Satellite solutions. This trend of hybridisation combines the satellite’s broadcast quality,
reach and economics with the interactivity of non-linear and terrestrial networks. Pay TV operators increasingly
bundle their offerings with non-linear video services, as consumers require convenient access to content
irrespective of distribution technology.

**_Supply and Demand for Satellite Communications_**

_Supply_

The supply of satellite capacity is affected by significant requirements for financial, technical, human,

natural and other resources. For instance, there are a limited number of orbital locations and limited radio
frequency spectrum available to commercial communications satellite operators. As a result, a limited number
of satellites can be placed into service over any particular geographic area. New entrants face the significant
capital costs of procuring and launching a satellite and must maintain the financial and highly specialised
technical resources required to operate a satellite system and market its services. Other regulatory requirements
must also be satisfied before a new entrant can provide services to, from or within a specific country. As such
the supply of satellite capacity is also constrained by a number of regulatory requirements at national, regional
and supra-national levels.

Available supply of satellite capacity varies significantly by region, frequency and market segment.

With respect to video distribution, “neighbourhoods” develop where many thousands or even millions of
consumer satellite dishes or cable head-ends are pointed at a specific orbital location or locations. Due to the
commercial attractiveness of those neighbourhoods developed over time as a result of significant investments by
satellite operators, video distribution networks prefer to secure expansion of satellite capacity from satellites
located at the orbital location(s), or neighbourhoods, to which their or their customers’ satellite dishes are
already pointed.


-----

_Demand_

Demand for satellite services is primarily driven by economic growth, both generally and within a

particular geographic area, growth in product or service markets, growth in demand for bandwidth-intensive
applications, technical advancements and improved regulatory access to new and existing markets.

In particular, SES believes the following factors will influence SatCom development in the next

decade:

Proliferation of Video content and format

Satellite operators are experiencing stable demand for both video distribution and contribution,

evidenced by a stable number of channels being broadcast. Demand is also driven by the increasing volume of
high-quality display formats, including a significant number of HDTV channels, which require two or three
times more bandwidth than standard definition channels for a given compression format. Demand for UHD (4K)
is growing, driven by the availability of UHD screens in the market and the heightened focus by DTH operators
on premium quality which will enable further differentiation among operators. Demand for higher picture
quality largely compensates for advances in compression technology. In addition, an increasing number of
movies and digital cinema are now shot in UHD. Commercial UHD broadcasts started in 2015, their number is
growing, and they are expected to become widespread by around 2025. Mobile and fixed telecommunication
companies are also turning to satellite as they face significant consumer demand for video content, both as an
add-on to complete triple-play bundles as well as embedding satellites in hybrid solutions to compensate for a
lack of terrestrial broadband coverage.

Proliferation of Data-centric applications

The market for data-centric applications is expected to show strong growth, with global industry

revenue across the Mobility, Fixed Data and Government market verticals projected to double in the decade
between 2019 and 2029, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 7 per cent. (source: Northern Sky
Research, Global Satellite Capacity Supply & Demand, 17[th] Edition, June 2020).

_Mobility. Applications such as maritime communications and aeronautical services are fuelling demand_

for satellite bandwidth. Significant technology advancements are enabling the provision of broadband
connectivity to a wide range of commercial passenger and business aircraft and different kinds of maritime
vessels. The same technologies are also able to furnish these links to manned and unmanned aeronautical
platforms and naval ships used by government and/or defence users.

_Fixed Data networks and applications. Corporate VSAT networks are being widely implemented in_

developing regions and markets as economic growth and foreign trade expands. Banking is among the sectors
driving this growth, along with multinational corporations in such regions and markets. Rapid growth in cellular
services in developing regions is expected to transition demand for voice-only services to demand for data and
video services over time, resulting in increased network bandwidth requirements. Given the low penetration of
fixed-line telephone services in developing markets and the introduction of smart phones, tablets and netbooks,
internet access in these markets may be primarily served by satellite connectivity.

The use of satellite networks has expanded in recent years to support oil and gas extraction and other

resource sectors such as mining. In more developed regions such as North America, oil and gas companies
increasingly rely on satellite since deposits are often located far from terrestrial infrastructure and the use of
remote real-time operations monitoring continues to increase. Demand for satellite capacity has been driven
both by growth in this sector as well as an increase in the use of bandwidth-intensive applications by such
operations.


-----

SatCom services also support broadband internet access for consumers and small businesses. The

capabilities of today’s high-throughput satellites allow internet satellite providers (ISPs) to offer high-speed
internet access comparable to terrestrial alternatives.

_Government._ Government digital inclusion projects to bring broadband services to rural and remote

communities and those with limited terrestrial infrastructure are an important and growing application being led
by civilian agencies in both developed and developing nations. These projects coincide with strong government
demand from national broadband programmes for rural connectivity and universal mobile coverage obligations.

Demand for satellite capacity from defence and military agencies around the world continues to grow.

The U.S. government remains the single largest user of commercial satellite communications capacity and most
of this use relates to U.S. Department of Defense operations.

**Customers and Services**

**_Overview_**

SES provides its services to customers worldwide, including broadcasters, telecommunications

companies, content and internet service providers, mobile and fixed network operators, network integrators and

-----

**_Services Agreements_**

The Group provides its satellite transponder capacity and related services under a variety of contract

terms. Satellite capacity contracts vary in length and content depending on the type of customer. The Group’s
contracts are up for renewal at various times in the future. The Group’s contracts generally do not have break
clauses and therefore must be honoured in full.

_Broadcasters. Contracts with broadcasters are generally long-term, with typical durations of five to ten_

years (and up to 15 years in certain cases) for customers in North America and Europe, and two to five years for
customers in developing markets. Such contracts can sometimes be for the whole of a satellite’s operational life
and can be for single or multiple transponders.

_Commercial enterprises. Contracts with commercial enterprises are generally three to five years in_

length, and the capacity contracted for will generally cover more than one geographic region.

_Government. Contracts with government customers are generally no longer than one year in length, as_

government customers generally cannot pre-empt an annual budget allocation. The Group has multi-year
framework agreements with many of its government customers pursuant to which the customer agrees that the
contract will be renewed as long as the agency receives the necessary funds. SES has recently signed five-year
agreements with U.S. government customers, signalling a move to consider longer-term contracts, to facilitate
operational requirements and secure capacity on more favourable terms.

Under the Group’s standard capacity allotment agreement, customers must obtain operating licences

from the relevant regulatory authorities, comply with regulations governing the content of audio-visual
programmes, obtain the rights to operate their earth stations and comply with the Group’s technical
specifications. The Group may also require a customer to provide a bank or other guarantee as security for
payment with regard to allotted capacity and in respect of the customer’s contractual obligations.

**Product Development and Management**

**_Overview_**

In order to ensure an effective client-solutions based approach, SES is building differentiated

capabilities in two market verticals where satellites have a predominant usage, SES Video and SES Networks which includes Fixed Data, Mobility and Government. Each vertical is addressed by a functional group that
develops and deploys commercial solutions and “go-to-market” strategies in their respective verticals.
Furthermore, these groups will ensure that developed solutions are fully leveraged across SES’s products &
services portfolio. The groups act in close collaboration with the various business support functions at the core
of SES, including the business development and engineering teams of SES.

In the Video segment, SES has expanded its capabilities beyond satellite infrastructure into video

service provisioning. SES offers specialised digital media services such as content aggregation, content
management, channel playout, OTT, VOD and content distribution via satellite, fibre and Internet Protocol (IP)
for broadcasters, TV channels, content owners, content aggregators, rights holders, sports organisations and
more. These services are provided globally, with principal business coming from Europe, the United States, the
Middle East, Africa and Asia. The suite of services is orchestrated by SES 360, a media platform for managing
and delivering linear and non-linear content to any broadcast, VOD or OTT platform.

SES also operates a separate business unit. HD+, which is organised and structured as an individual

entity. Created in 2009, HD+ provides broadcasters in Germany with a method to deliver their HD content to
paying audiences via satellite. In 2019, HD+ launched what it believes to be the first HbbTV operator app
("HD+ integrated in TV"). HD+ integrated in TV works like a virtual set-top box directly in the television set 

-----

in the "look and feel" of HD+. The consumer does not need to purchase an additional set-top box or CI+ module
to use HD+.

In the Networks segment, SES has also expanded its capabilities beyond satellite infrastructure into service
provisioning. SES is leveraging its unique GEO/MEO satellite infrastructure to offer managed connectivity
solutions that enable cloud adoption and seamless integration in the broader communications ecosystem on a
global scale.

**Satellite Fleet**

**_Network and Technology_**

_Network_

The Group’s global network is currently comprised of 52 GEO and 20 MEO satellites as well as

ground facilities, including teleports and leased fibre, which support the Group’s commercial services and the
operation and control of its satellites. Features of the Group’s network include:

- prime orbital locations, reflecting a valuable portfolio of coordinated fixed satellite spectrum rights;

- currently 99.999 per cent. space service availability of commercialisable transponders on the SES fleet;

- flexibility, subject to contractual restrictions in some cases, to relocate satellites to other orbital
locations, such as when there are changes in demand patterns or requirements of new customers;

- design features and steerable beams on many of the Group’s satellites, enabling the Group to
reconfigure capacity to provide different areas of coverage and to operate in different frequency bands;
and

- multiple satellites serving each region, allowing for alternatives if a satellite anomaly should occur.

_Satellite Systems_

All of the Group’s GEO satellites are located approximately 22,300 miles, or 35,700 kilometres, above

the equator. GEO satellites can receive radio frequency communications from an origination point, and
distribute those signals to a single or multiple receivers within the coverage areas of the satellites’ transmission
beams.

All of the Group’s MEO satellites are located approximately 5000 miles, or 8000 kilometres, above the

Equator. MEO satellites can receive and transmit radio frequency communications bidirectionally between
large earth stations (“gateways”) and customer terminals, serving data centric applications. The proximity of the
satellites to the earth enables a shorter time between transmission and reception of signals by customer terminals
(“low latency”) than the GEO fleet. This is important for those applications which require low latency
transmissions.

The SES MEO fleet uses a part of the radio frequency spectrum denoted as “Ka-band”, with high

power, very narrow beams facilitating high throughput primarily to serve cost effective data applications; Kaband is more susceptible to rain fade than the other bands typically used for satellite transmission. The SES
GEO fleet transmit using a variety of sub bands of the radio frequency spectrum depending on the spectrum
available for use at each orbital location, which may include one or more of the following bands:

- C-band – low power, broad beams that require use of relatively large reception antennae; the spectrum
least susceptible to weather-related transmission impairments.


-----

- Ku-band – high power, narrow to medium size beams facilitating use of smaller antennae which are
favoured by businesses and private end customers; optimal for DTH applications; generally, highly
reliable and seldom affected by weather-related impairments.

- Ku-band – high power, very narrow beams facilitating high throughput and use of smaller customer
antennas primarily optimised for data applications. Generally, highly reliable and seldom affected by
weather-related impairments. This form of Ku-band is used on HTS.

- Ka-band – high power, very narrow beams facilitating high throughput and use of smaller customer
antennas primarily for data applications; Ka-band is more susceptible to rain fade than lower bands.
The Ka-band is optimised for data applications. This implementation of Ka-band is used in Military
Ka-band (GovSat-1) – a specific part of the Ka-band reserved for governmental applications.

- X-band – medium power with medium size beams used exclusively for governmental applications like
communications on the move.

- L-Band – low power with broad beams used for global navigation satellite systems.

A GEO satellite is identified as geostationary (or station-kept) when it is operated in an assigned

segment of the geo-stationary arc, which is designated by a specific range of latitudes and longitudes. GEO
satellites revolve around the earth at an angular velocity that corresponds to that of the earth’s rotation and thus
appear to stay above a fixed point on the Earth’s surface at all times.

GEO satellites that are only station-kept in longitude are said to be in inclined orbit. The daily north
south motion of a satellite in inclined orbit exceeds the specified range of latitudes of its assigned stationkeeping box, and the satellite appears to oscillate slowly, moving above and below the equator every day. An
operator will typically operate a satellite in inclined orbit toward the end of its service life because significant
amounts of propellant will be saved by not controlling the north-south position of the satellite, therefore
substantially extending the service life of the satellite. The kinds of services and customers that can access an
inclined orbit satellite have traditionally been limited due to the movement of the satellite relative to a fixed
ground antenna. However, recent innovations now allow the use of inclined orbit capacity for certain
applications. As a result, if these applications are successfully introduced, the Group anticipates that demand for
inclined orbit capacity may increase over the next few years. As of the date of this Prospectus, 15 of the Group’s
satellites were operating in an inclined orbit, with half continuing to earn revenue beyond SES’s original
estimated life for each of these satellites.

HTS are a relatively new class of satellites at GEO or MEO orbits, configured to optimise the available

frequencies, typically Ku-band or Ka-band, via frequency re-use. This is achieved by the re-use of parts of the
available frequencies in segregated spot beams, enabling higher data rates to be offered at a lower cost per bit
than traditionally configured satellites (so called “Widebeam” satellites). HTS offer high capacities, typically
feeding datacentric applications for fixed or mobile terminals. The MEO fleet is fully classified as a Ka HTS
architecture. In the GEO arc, SES has three Ku HTS satellites in operation (SES-12, SES-14 and SES-15), and
one Ka HTS SES-17 planned for launch in Q3 2021 with operational start date in H1 2022).

_In-Orbit Satellites_

The Group’s operations and engineering staff are involved from the design stage through to the

decommissioning of each satellite procured. The Group’s employees work at the manufacturers’ and launchers’
sites to monitor progress, which enables the Group to maintain close technical collaboration with its contractors
during the process of designing, manufacturing and launching a satellite. Extensive monitoring of earth station
operations and constant satellite control and network operations support ensure consistent operational quality, as
well as timely corrections when problems arise. In addition, the Group has established contingency plans for
technical problems that may occur during the lifetime of a satellite.


-----

These features also contribute to the resilience of the Group’s network, which enables the Group to

ensure the continuity of service that is important for its customers and to retain flexibility in the event that it
needs to move customers to alternative capacity. The design flexibility of some of the Group’s satellites enables
it to meet customer demand and respond to changing market conditions.

_End of Design Life_

End of design life is the point beyond which successful operation of the satellite is no longer covered

by the manufacturers’ qualification programmes and reliability predictions. Various elements are considered in
satellite design, such as the length of the mission, equipment reliability and redundancy schemes, limited life
terms and impacts of the space environment, as well as required power generation levels. Satellites that have
reached the end of their design lives may be re-orbited and placed in a “graveyard orbit” beyond the
geostationary orbit, or in some instances, may remain in operation, as in many cases those satellites are launched
with enough on-board propellant to enable station-keeping, or inclined-orbit operations, beyond their design
lives.

As of 31 December 2020, the 52 GEO operational satellites of SES have depreciable lives between 10

and 18 years, with an average depreciable life currently of 14.9 years. 20 of the satellites have already reached
the end of their depreciable life; for the other satellites the average remaining depreciable life is 7.5 years.

As of 31 December 2020, of the 20 MEO operational satellites of SES, 16 have depreciable lives

between 10 and 12 years, with an average depreciable life currently of 11.3 years. The other four satellites were
depreciated early due to technical issues with those satellites; for the other satellites the average remaining
depreciable life is 7.2 years.

_Network Operations and Current Ground Facilities_

The Group has satellite operations centres in Betzdorf (Grand Duchy of Luxembourg), Princeton (New

Jersey), and Manassas (Virginia), from which the Group controls and operates each of its satellites and payloads
(with the exception of QuetzSat-1, SES-7, SES-14 and the YahLive payload, which are operated by third
parties) and manages the communications services for which each satellite is used. These centres utilise a
network of ground facilities, including earth stations that provide tracking, telemetry and control (TT&C)
services for the Group’s satellites. This network also includes teleports, leased fibre and network performance
monitoring systems. Through these ground facilities, the Group continually monitors signal quality, endeavours
to protect bandwidth from any interference and maintains customer-installed equipment and analyses telemetry
from the Group’s satellites in order to monitor their status and track their location. In the event that one centre is
unavailable or disabled, each other centre has the ability to provide instantaneous restoration of satellite control
services on behalf of the other.

_Capacity Sparing and Backup and General Satellite Risk Management_

As part of the Group’s satellite risk management, the Group continually evaluates and designs plans to

mitigate the risks posed to its fleet. The Group attempts to mitigate the risk of in-orbit failure by careful vendor
selection, stringent satellite design and test requirements and active procurement oversight and high-quality inorbit operations. The impacts of such failures on customer service and related revenue are mitigated by an inorbit backup strategy where customers on an impaired satellite can be transferred to another satellite in the fleet.
The Group maintains some form of backup capacity for each satellite designated as being in primary operating
service, which may include:

  - designated reserve transponders on the satellite or other on-board backup systems or designed-in
redundancies;

  - co-location of satellites at the same orbital position;


-----

  - an in-orbit spare satellite; or

  - interim restoration capacity on other satellites.

SES also has satellite control backup capability utilising European and U.S.-based satellite operations

centres. Each satellite control centre is able to take over operations of all, or a portion thereof, satellite
operations, to ensure full redundancy in contingency operations.

For information on the insurance policies the Group obtains for its fleet, see section “Insurance” below.

**_Investment Programme_**

_Recent and forthcoming satellite launches_

The following launches took place between 2018 and 2020:

  - SES-14, embarked on Ariane 5 launched on 26 January 2018, located at 47.5°W;

  - GovSat-1, on board a SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicle on 31 January 2018, located at 21.5°W;

  - Four O3b MEO satellites (satellites 13-16), on board a Soyuz rocket on 9 March 2018;

  - SES-12, on board a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, launched on 4 June 2018, located at 95° E; and

  - Four O3b MEO satellites (satellites 17-20), on board a Soyuz rocket on 4 April 2019.

Between 2021 and 2024, the new O3b generation of satellites (O3b mPOWER) composed of 11

satellites will be launched and added to the O3b existing fleet. 7 satellites were ordered in 2017 and an
additional 4 in 2020. The 4 additional O3b mPOWER satellites de-risk overall investment through launch
resiliency, enhanced launch cadence, improved constellation efficiency and expansion in coverage and
throughput. This new constellation being built by Boeing Satellite Systems will deliver multiple terabits of
throughput globally and will have 35,000 fully-shapeable and steerable beams that can be shifted and switched
in real time to align with customers’ quickly changing growth opportunities. O3b mPOWER will provide
coverage to an area of nearly 400 million square kilometers, four fifths of the Earth’s surface.

In Q3 2021, SES-17 is also expected to be launched. This GEO satellite is a powerful high throughput

satellite being built by Thales Alenia Space. SES has simultaneously entered into a long-term commercial
agreement with Thales to offer FlytLIVE, a new inflight connectivity service over the Americas and the Atlantic
Ocean region. SES will operate the satellite infrastructure for FlytLIVE, as well as the complementary ground
network.

In 2022, 4 satellites will be launched as part of the US C-band accelerated clearing (SES-18, SES-19,

SES-20, SES-21). Two satellites each are being built by Northrop Grunman and Boeing Satellite Systems. An
additional two satellites (SES-22, SES-23) have been ordered from Thales Alenia Space. In August 2020, the
launch vehicle providers for the four new C-band satellites were announced, with two satellites being launched
by United Launch Alliance (Atlas rocket) and two by SpaceX (Falcon 9 rocket).

_Capital Expenditure_

SES expects to continue to invest in satellites, both to replace existing satellites before their end of life,

and to make available new capacity at new or existing orbital positions to meet growing demand. GEO-MEO
capital expenditure (growth and replacement capacity, excluding acquisitions, financial investments, and US Cband repurposing) was EUR 321 million in 2018, EUR 308 million in 2019, EUR 217 million in 2020 and is
expected to be EUR 660 million in 2021, EUR 880 million in 2022, reflecting growth investment (SES-17 and
O3b mPOWER), EUR 220 million in 2023, EUR 570 million in 2024 and EUR 340 million in 2025,


-----

representing an average annual capital expenditure of EUR 375 million between 2023 to 2025. The majority of
projected future capital expenditure relates to satellite investment and is based on the Group’s current launch
and service schedule in respect of procured satellites.

_Financing_

The financing of ongoing satellite procurement programmes is done through a range of structures,

including, without limitation, through a mix of available resources, cash flow from operations, and drawings
under existing funding arrangements where needed.

**_Procurement Contracts_**

The Group regularly enters into satellite construction contracts to procure satellites from

manufacturers. The typical time required to manufacture and launch a satellite is approximately 30-36 months
(but can take more time depending on the complexity of the satellite). These contracts generally provide for
payments to be made at certain milestones. In addition, the manufacturer may have to pay damages to the Group
in the event that construction of the satellite is not completed on time.

**_Launch Agreements_**

SES enters into launch agreements from time to time and has not entered into a multi-year agreement

with a launcher provider.

**_Satellite Health_**

The Group’s fleet is diversified by manufacturer and satellite type, which reduces the likelihood of

widespread technical problems and therefore any substantial negative impact on the Group’s customers and
operations. The anomalies experienced to date have had little long-term impact on the overall transponder
availability in the Group’s fleet, due to an ability to deploy back-up transponders or satellites to ensure adequate
coverage. All of the Group’s satellites have been designed to withstand an expected rate of equipment failure
with adequate redundancy to meet or exceed their orbital design lives with a probability of 75 per cent. or more.
The Group has contingency plans in place that are tailored to a number of factors, including the mission, the
strategic importance of the satellite, the location of the satellite and the type of anomaly. After anomalies, SES
has usually been able to restore service on the affected satellite, provide alternative capacity on another satellite
in its fleet or provide capacity purchased from another satellite operator. However, see the risk factor “The
_Group’s satellites may experience in-orbit destruction, damage or other failures or degradations in_
_performance that could impair the satellites’ commercial performance”._

**_Insurance_**

SES maintains launch and initial in-orbit insurance (i.e., one policy typically covers the launch and an

initial period (usually 12 to 16 months) after the launch), an in-orbit insurance which covers satellites that have
book value after the initial 12 or 16 months post the launch as well as third party liability insurance for its
satellites. The insurance policies generally contain exclusions from losses resulting from:

- military or similar action;

- any anti-satellite device;

- electromagnetic and radio interference except for physical damage to a satellite directly resulting from
this interference;

- confiscation by any governmental body;

- insurrection and similar acts or governmental action to prevent such acts;


-----

- nuclear reaction or radiation contamination;

- cyber attacks;

- wilful or intentional acts of the named insured causing the loss or failure of satellites; and

- terrorism, including unlawful seizure or wrongful exercise control of satellite.

Insurance policies also contemplate technical margins relating to the propellant lifetime and solar array

power generating capability of the satellites.

The Group generally purchases insurance with reputable insurers having S&P’s and AM-best ratings of

A- or better. The Group may use less than A- rated insurers but their participation is limited to a small
percentage.

It is the Group’s policy to obtain launch insurance for its satellites. Launch plus one year (L+1)

insurance provides coverage from the moment of launch until one year in orbit thereafter (or in some cases a
slightly longer period such as 16 months), in an amount equal to the fully capitalised cost of the satellite, which
generally includes the construction costs, the L+1 insurance premium, the cost of the launch services, project
management costs, non-reusable ground segment costs and capitalised interest (but may exclude portions of the
ground segment which may be reused in case of launch failure). In limited instances, the Group may retain up to
15 per cent. of the risk for the period starting at separation of the spacecraft from the launch vehicle, while the
launch phase itself would remain fully covered.

Upon expiration of their L+1 policies, all the Group’s satellites, excluding only satellites owned

through joint venture share of less than 50 per cent., are insured through the Group’s in-orbit fleet insurance
policy. SES has adopted a policy of limited self-insurance by which SES self-insures a chosen deductible and
external insurance covers losses in excess of the deductible up to a cap. In-orbit insurance premiums are paid to
a wholly owned subsidiary, which assumes only part of the risk, and a portion of the risk is reinsured with
external insurance companies. In-orbit insurance coverage, which may initially be for an amount comparable to
launch insurance levels, generally decreases over time and is typically based on the net book value of the
satellite which declines every year. The Group does not currently insure against lost revenue in the event of a
total or partial loss of a satellite.

As of 1 January 2021, none of the Group’s satellites in orbit were covered by an L+1 policy and 47 of

the satellites in the Group’s fleet with book value were covered by in-orbit insurance.

The Group also procures in-orbit third party liability insurance for all its satellites. Such insurance is

renewed annually and currently provides a yearly combined single limit of €500 million of coverage.

**_Sales and Marketing_**

The Group’s global headquarters are located in Betzdorf (Grand Duchy of Luxembourg). It operates

worldwide through dedicated regional teams in local sales, technical, marketing and customer support offices in
key locations around the world for the markets it serves.

SES combines local experience close to its customers and a commercial approach focused on taking

initiative in its markets. Its collaborative way of doing business delivers solutions that facilitate success for
customers and market partners.

**_Financing structure of the Group_**

The Group has a well-balanced financing structure with access to various sources of funding, including

the Eurobond markets, the U.S. Dollar bond markets, commercial paper markets and bank financing. As of 31


-----

December 2020, the Group had a debt profile with an average maturity of 7.23 years and an average cost of 3.14
per cent. per annum. The Group’s liquidity position was €2,362 million as of 31 December 2020, taking into
account cash and cash equivalents of €1,162.3 million as of 31 December 2020 combined with the Group’s fully
undrawn syndicated multi-currency loan facility of €1,200 million signed in January 2014 and renewed in June
2019.

**Competition**

The Group competes in the communication market for the provision of satellite communication

services to broadcasters, content owners and ISPs, mobile and fixed network operators and corporate and
governmental customers worldwide. Communication services are provided using various communication
technologies, including satellite networks, which provide services as a substitute for, or as a complement to, the
capabilities of terrestrial networks. The Group’s main competitors are other major international satellite
operators, such as Intelsat, Eutelsat and Telesat as well as many regional operators active across Asia, the
Middle East, Latin America, Africa, North America and Europe. All these satellite operators offer a combination
of point-to-multipoint and point-to-point services. The Group also faces competition from suppliers of terrestrial
communications capacity which may be transcontinental, regional, national or metropolitan in scope, and
delivered via fibre copper lines or coaxial cables, as well as via 2G/3G/4G/5G or microwave systems. All of the
above may also be provided by re-sellers, who purchase satellite or non-satellite capacity and then resell it in the
market.

In Europe, the Group’s principal competition is from terrestrial distribution technologies and

competing satellite operators. SES’s main competitor in the European space market is Eutelsat, a French satellite
operator. Other competitors include smaller operators in the region such as HispaSat, Telenor, Hellas Sat,
Arabsat, Turksat and Spacecom.

In North America, the Group’s principal satellite competitor is Intelsat, with Telesat, Eutelsat and some

others also providing capacity in the market. Vertically integrated player Viasat is also a competitor in the North
American Networks segment, DTH television in North America has long been a service provided by vertically
integrated companies DirecTV and EchoStar, both of whom own their own satellite fleets. SES supplies
EchoStar and affiliated companies with transmission capacity to supplement that of EchoStar’s own fleet.

In the rest of the world, there are several other, well established, regional satellite operators that

compete with SES, the most prominent ones being StarOne of Brazil, AsiaSat, APT and China Satcom of China,
MEASAT of Malaysia, ISRO of India, RSCC of Russia, JSAT of Japan and Arabsat of Saudi Arabia.
Competitors vary according to the region being served.

Use of export credit financing from China’s EXIM Bank, COFACE and the U.S. Ex-Im Bank have

enabled the funding of national satellite programmes. Chinese and Russian satellite manufacturers have also
offered attractive terms and vendor financing to developing countries. Together, they have engendered a wave
of national satellite programmes in countries such as Venezuela, Kazakhstan, Vietnam, Nigeria, Pakistan,
Ukraine, Belarus, Bolivia, Laos, Sri Lanka and several others. This is adding to the supply of satellite capacity
in many regions of the world.

Additionally, global LEO constellations namely SpaceX, Starlink, OneWeb, Telesat Lightspeed and

Amazon Kuiper are being developed and will augment the competitive landscape in the future.

Please also see section “Industry Overview and Trends” above.

**Property, Plant and Equipment**

**_Offices and satellite operation centres_**


-----

The Group’s administrative headquarters are located in Luxembourg. These headquarters also house

one of the Group’s main offices and one of the prime satellite operations centres. The land that underlies these
buildings is partially owned and partially leased on a long-term basis from the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg
government pursuant to a lease that expires in 2029. The Group also has key offices in The Hague (the
Netherlands), Princeton (New Jersey), McLean (Virginia), Reston (Virginia), Manassas (Virginia), Washington
(DC), Unterföhring (Germany), Bucharest, Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), Dubai and Singapore. In Israel, SES has its
main offices at Airport City (near Tel Aviv) and also owns a teleport at Emek HaEla.

In total, the Group has more than 60 sites including satellite services centres and more than 20 offices

in nearly 40 countries around the world, a substantial majority of which it leases.

The satellite operations facility of LuxGovSat S.A., a joint venture between SES and the Luxembourg

government, is also located in Luxembourg.

**_Assets_**

The Group’s principal tangible assets are its satellites, its teleports and its ground network.

The Group uses a worldwide ground network to operate its satellite fleet and to manage the

communications services that it provides to its customers. The ground infrastructure network is mainly
composed of TT&C and/or data/video service uplink/downlink sites and communications systems monitoring
sites. The earth stations in the Group’s ground network provide commercial TT&C and/or data/video service
uplink/downlink and beam-monitoring services. The Group owns teleports in the United States, Luxembourg
and Germany and leases facilities at more than 50 other locations for satellite/commercial operations worldwide
(excluding SESGS sites and SOHO (Small Office / Home Office type offices). The Group also contracts with
the owners of some of these facilities for the provision of additional services. The Group’s network also consists
of the leased communications links that connect the teleports and service gateways to its satellite operations
centres or platform locations as well as to customer sites and general carrier POPs (points of presence for
network carriers/providers).

The leases relating to the Group’s teleports, points of presence and office space expire at various times.

SES does not believe that any such properties are individually material to the Group’s business or operations,
and expect that the Group could find suitable properties to replace such locations if the leases were not renewed
at the end of their respective terms.

**Employees**

As of 31 December 2020, the Group employed 2,113 individuals worldwide. This breaks down to 646

in its Luxembourg headquarters, 495 in the rest of Europe, 623 in the US, and 349 in the rest of the world. SES
is a truly international company represented by 71 different nationalities within the U.S. (623 employees),
Germany (315), Israel (183), France (121) and the UK (119) as top five nationalities by number of employees.

**_Arrangements involving the employees in the capital of SES_**

SES offers stock-based compensation plans to employees and executives. The purpose of the plans is to

enhance the competitiveness of the Group in attracting and retaining the best global executive talent, and to
position SES as a global employer of choice.

Moreover, the plans are designed to make sure that SES employees and executives become

shareholders of SES, feel a sense of ownership and benefit from their contribution to increasing shareholder
value.

Executives are eligible to participate in the Equity Based Compensation Plan (EBCP), which is

composed of three different elements:


-----

  - stock options, representing one third of the total equity grant and which are vesting in quarters on 1
January of each of the first four years following their grant and remain exercisable until 10 years after
the grant;

  - restricted shares, representing one sixth of the total equity grant, which are FDRs granted with the sole
condition that at the day the shares vest, the beneficiary is employed by SES. The Restricted Shares
vest on the third year following the year of the grant; and

  - performance shares, representing half of the total equity grant and which is subject to both individual
performance criteria and the company´s financial performance. The latter is measured by the
compounded Economic Value Added over the vesting period of three years.

Employees are eligible to participate in the Stock Appreciation Rights (STAR) Plan. Under this plan,

employees are granted annually simulated restricted stock units which are cash-settled awards vesting over a
three-year vesting period.

**Intellectual Property**

SES has a significant portfolio of international patents managed by its patent board and internationally

registered trademarks to operate its business worldwide. The Group protects its proprietary business
information, products, services and branding in a variety of ways, including relying on trade secret, patent and
trademark laws, entering into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, including confidentiality and data
protection clauses in commercial agreements and following internal corporate policies and procedures in
relation to intellectual property.

SES is currently not involved in any litigation as a result of a breach of its intellectual property by any

party or as a result of SES’s breach of another party’s intellectual property.

**Environmental Matters**

The Group’s operations are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the

environment. The Group, as an owner or operator of property and in connection with current and historical
operations at some of its sites, could incur significant costs, including clean-up costs, fines, sanctions and thirdparty claims, as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations. For instance,
some of the Group’s operations require continuous power supply, and, as a result, current and past operations at
its teleport and other technical facilities have included fuel storage and batteries for back-up power generators.
However, the Group believes that its operations are in compliance with environmental laws and regulations.

In addition, the Group is committed to further limiting the environmental impact of its activities, such

as by designing and building new technical facilities according to the imperatives of sustainability and energy
efficiency. The Group also regularly conducts carbon footprint measurements in order to monitor and control
the greenhouse gas emissions generated by its operations.

In 2019, SES’s activities related to operating and commercialising SES’s satellite fleet, as well as

general administration, finance and marketing, generated approximately 47,798 tons of CO2 emissions
worldwide, a decrease of 5 per cent. compared to 2018. This decrease was due to less business travel, decreased
energy consumption and energy optimisation initiatives implemented at offices and teleports.

Emissions from Scope 2, electricity consumption, represented the largest component of SESs’ total

emissions (approximately 62 per cent.). Scope 2 location-based emissions factors were chosen in line with the
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol recommendations. For low occupancy sites, assumptions were made based on
average electricity, gas and travel data at the main office sites. A data collection questionnaire was circulated to
all 38 main SES global sites in order to collect activity data. A large sample of low occupancy and unmanned


-----

SES sites were included in the data collection exercise. In order to calculate GHG emissions, when electrical
power consumption was not precisely measured, it was estimated.

The Group also seeks to apply best practices to minimise the environmental impact of outsourced

activities, including the manufacture and launch of spacecraft.

SES does itself does not manufacture or launch the spacecraft; SES contracts these services from third party
providers (see: _SES CDP Climate Change Questionnaire 2019: C0.1 Introduction)[19]. However, SES applies a_
responsible fleet management approach together with its satellite manufacturer to mitigate the environmental
impact and to minimise space debris (see Annual Report 2020 page 35).

**ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE GROUP**

As of 31 December 2020, the Group comprised SES and its subsidiaries, along with its associates, and

includes the following types of entities, a substantial portion of which are wholly owned:

- Operating companies, which perform substantially all of the Group’s satellite operations. These
companies have historically owned the bulk of satellites, orbital slot licences and/or ground
infrastructure. They are also responsible for a substantial portion of the Group’s payroll for employees
in all fields of satellite operations. Operating companies are the market-facing entities of the Group,
entering into customer contracts and providing the Group’s core satellite communication services and
value-added services to external customers.

- Single satellite companies, each of which is individually insured for in-orbit failures with the Group’s
captive insurance company.

- Marketing companies, which give the Group a local marketing presence in key markets and are often
associated with local affiliates. Marketing affiliates do not enter into customer contracts.

- Engineering companies, which supports the SES Engineering function.

- Holding companies, which hold the Group’s financial assets. Historically, many of these companies
were established for management reporting purposes and/or corporate organisational reasons.

- Regulatory companies, which are incorporated in those jurisdictions that do not permit foreign entities
to sell capacity to local customers or obtain licences, enter into concession agreements or acquire
landing rights.

- Finance companies, are responsible for the Group’s captive finance and insurance operations. Finance
companies perform centralised funding, cash management, foreign exchange and interest rate hedging
and insurance activities for Group entities. They also play important roles in external or internal
funding or cash flows of the Group.

A full list of SES’s subsidiaries and associates as at 31 December 2020 can be found at note 36 to the
consolidated financial statements for SES for the year ended 31 December 2020, which are incorporated by
reference in this Prospectus.

**REGULATION**

**Introduction**

SES’s business is regulated by a number of national and international regulatory authorities. SES is

subject to the regulatory authority of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the United States, The Netherlands,
Germany, the United Kingdom, Gibraltar, the Isle of Man, the Bailiwick of Jersey (Jersey), Mexico, Canada,
Sweden, the EU, Bermuda, the Andean Community, Brazil, France and of the countries and regions in which it
operates, as well as the Radio Regulations and frequency coordination process of the ITU.

The regulation of the Group’s business can be divided into three broad categories:

- Rules governing the operation of the Group’s satellite networks, including rules relating to the:

`o` launch and operation of satellites;

`o` allocation and licensing of space orbital locations and spectrum;

`o` licensing of ground infrastructure; and

`o` licensing of communications services and associated equipment;

- antitrust and competition laws, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws which are generally applicable to
national and international businesses; and

- other regulations, including rules restricting the export of satellite-related equipment and technology,
regulations related to sanctions and other provisions applicable to the Group’s business.

Countries vary in their approaches to satellite licensing. Some countries grant licences based on orbital

locations (GEO), orbit (NGSO) and/or frequencies, while others grant licences based on a specific satellite at a
particular orbital location and the associated frequencies. In addition, SES is subject to the laws and regulations
of countries to, from or within which it provides services or offers satellite capacity. Numerous markets in
which SES does business require some form of market access approval or authorisation prior to SES offering
capacity or services in those markets. SES seeks such approvals or authorisations as required but cannot be
certain that all such approvals or authorisations will be granted in a timely manner or at all. Such approvals and
authorisations may also be subject to conditions that constrain operations and/or impose heavy licensing and/or
spectrum fees to be paid to national governments.

Countries or regulatory authorities may adopt or modify laws, policies or regulations, or change their

interpretation of existing laws, policies or regulations, that could cause existing authorisations to be changed or
cancelled, require SES to incur additional costs or otherwise adversely affect operations or revenue. Any
regulatory approvals are subject to modification, rescission, expiration and renewal.

If SES fails to obtain or maintain particular approvals, including for market access, on acceptable

terms, such failure could delay or prevent the offering of some or all of its services and adversely affect the
results of its operations, business prospects and financial condition. In particular, SES may not be able to obtain
all of the required regulatory approvals for the construction, launch and operation of any future satellites, or for
use of the orbital positions planned for these satellites. Even if SES is able to obtain the necessary approvals and
orbital positions, the licences obtained may impose significant operational restrictions or permit interference by
others that could affect the use of the satellites.

**Regulation of the Group’s Satellite Systems**

**_Luxembourg_**

SES ASTRA, S.A. (SES ASTRA) (a subsidiary of the Group) holds its rights to operate from

Luxembourg pursuant to a concession agreement granted by the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, pursuant to
Article 20 of the 1991 Law of Electronic Media as amended (la loi du 27 juillet 1991 sur les médias
_électroniques), and an associated term sheet (the_ _Cahier des Charges). The concession agreement, which was_
amended in 1998, 2001, 2004, 2010, 2018 and 2020, is in effect until 31 December 2021 (the **_Concession_**
**_Agreement or the Concession). As discussed further below, a new concession agreement will come into effect_**
on 1 January 2022 and will remain valid until 31 December 2041.

Under the Concession Agreement, as amended, SES ASTRA has the right to operate satellites in the

orbits and frequencies listed in a Register of Rights of Use, including satellites in the Ku-band and the Ka-band
at the following nominal orbital positions: 19.1°-19.3° East, 23.4°-23.6° East, 28.1-28.6° East and 31.0-31.5°
East. The Concession Agreement also permits the operation of one or more satellites in the Ka-band and the
military X-band frequencies at the 21.4-21.6° East orbital position. Additional frequencies, orbital positions
and/or orbits may be added to the Register under the Concession upon two months prior notice to the
Luxembourg government (the **_Government). The Government may object to any such addition by sending_**
written notice one month prior to the expected date for the commencement of operations at that slot. The 66.967.1° East orbital position was added to the Register for the 2021 launch of the SES-17 satellite.

The Concession includes the right to make satellite capacity available to users for the transmission of

electronic media and other electronic communications services. It also includes the right to establish, on
Luxembourg territory, mobile or fixed earth stations to operate the satellites, to perform telemetry, tracking and
command operations and to provide communications links with the satellites.

Under the Concession, SES ASTRA is required, within a typical timeframe, to regularly improve its

services to users through the implementation of economically justifiable new techniques whose financing could
legitimately be expected from SES ASTRA. SES ASTRA may not abandon or interrupt the exploitation of the
Concession other than in exceptional circumstances, as a result of force majeure or after prior written approval
of the Government.

Until 31 December 2021, SES ASTRA has a priority right in the event that the Government

contemplates granting rights to third parties to establish and operate a satellite system using Luxembourg
frequencies. If SES ASTRA cannot reach an agreement with Luxembourg on those rights, Luxembourg can
grant those rights to third parties on terms and conditions similar to those offered to SES ASTRA.

The Concession is not transferable and expires on 31 December 2021. A new concession agreement

was signed on 5 February 2020 and will come into effect from 1 January 2022 (the New Concession Agreement
or the **_New Concession). The New Concession Agreement is on substantially similar terms to the Concession_**
Agreement, except for an annual Concession fee of EUR 1 million and the loss of SES ASTRA’s priority right
with respect to the grant of rights to third parties to establish and operate a satellite system using Luxembourg
frequencies. The New Concession Agreement will be in force until 31 December 2041, after which it will be
automatically extended unless either party formally initiates a re-negotiation within a specified time before its
expiry.

On 15 December 2020, Luxembourg enacted a new Law on Space Activities (loi du 15 décembre 2020

_portant sur les activités spatiales) under which entities that engage in space activities, such as SES, will need to_
obtain a licence from the Luxembourg Space Agency. As a Concession holder, SES has until 31 December 2022
to obtain such licence. SES has no reason to believe that such a licence would not be granted and does not


-----

expect that such licence would impose materially more onerous obligations in relation to the conduct of space
activities than are currently applicable under the Concession.

_Customers and other Commercial Arrangements_

Both the Concession Agreement and the New Concession Agreement authorise SES ASTRA to enter

into agreements for the use of satellite capacity with customers on such commercial and other terms as SES
ASTRA may agree so long as:

- the customers agree to comply with all relevant conditions of the Cahier des Charges;

- the customers are required to comply with the relevant national legislation and any applicable
international conventions; and

- the Government does not object to the operations of the relevant customer.

Any total or partial transfer to a third party by a customer of its satellite capacity is subject to the

written and prior approval of SES ASTRA and the absence of objection by the Government. To date, the
Government has not exercised its right to object to a customer or any transferee that SES ASTRA has approved.
If a customer seriously breaches either its transponder agreement or the provisions of the associated term sheet
and continues to do so notwithstanding any notice that SES ASTRA may have given to it, the Government can
require SES ASTRA to suspend transmission of that customer’s services. If a transponder contract is suspended
for such a breach, neither SES ASTRA nor the Government is liable to the customer for any compensation for
the cessation of the transmissions. Similarly, SES ASTRA is not indemnified by the Government for any losses
incurred as a result of a justified/legitimate interruption of transmission. To date, the Government has not
required SES ASTRA to suspend a customer’s transmissions.

Further, the use of the Ka-band and the military X-band frequencies at the 21.4-21.6° East orbital

position are reserved for use by countries, intergovernmental organisations or associated agencies approved by
the Government and which are not subject to applicable United Nations or EU sanctions. The frequencies must
be used in compliance with national and international law. SES ASTRA must suspend or terminate any service
determined by the Government to violate such laws. For further information, please see _“Satellite Fleet –_
_Investment Programme” above._

_Government Supervision_

Pursuant to the Concession Agreement, the Government is entitled to appoint up to three

commissioners to supervise SES ASTRA’s compliance with the Concession Agreement and associated term
sheet. Under the New Concession Agreement, the Government is entitled to appoint up to two commissioners.
Currently, Luxembourg has two appointed commissioners who may participate in general meetings of SES
ASTRA’s shareholders and meetings of the Board of Directors or any of its committees. The commissioner may
oppose any measure taken or envisaged by SES ASTRA that would, amongst others, be contrary to
Luxembourg law or international conventions applicable to the Government, or compromise the exploitation of
the concession or the public order of Luxembourg. The commissioner may oppose and suspend any measure
taken by SES ASTRA. SES ASTRA has five days to appeal against any suspension failing which the suspension
becomes a permanent veto. Appeals are to the cabinet of the Government which is required to decide any appeal
within 21 days.

The articles of incorporation of SES ASTRA may not be modified without the Government’s prior

written approval. The Government may only oppose any modifications of the articles of incorporation of SES
ASTRA in the case where such changes (i) will be contrary to national law or international conventions or (ii)
will compromise the exploitation of the Concession. In addition, under the Concession Agreement and the New


-----

Concession Agreement, certain allocations or transfers of shares of SES ASTRA require the Government’s
written approval.

_Modification of the Concession Terms_

The Government can unilaterally amend the terms and conditions of the Concession Agreement or the

New Concession, as set out in the _Cahier des Charges. If a modification adversely affects the financial and_
commercial benefits of the Concession Agreement or of the New Concession Agreement, the Government must
indemnify SES ASTRA for any detriment and loss of income SES ASTRA suffers, failing which (or if such
indemnification is not reasonably acceptable) SES ASTRA can terminate the concession on 12 months’ notice
without liability for compensation and without prejudice to SES ASTRA’s right to claim damages. Any
substantial modification of the _Cahier des Charges which definitively disrupts the financial and commercial_
balance between the Government and SES ASTRA will be treated as an outright termination of the Concession
or of the New Concession that is in contravention of the Electronic Media Law. In such an event, the
Government will be liable to indemnify SES ASTRA for losses incurred and other damages, including
consequential damages such as any depreciation in value of assets, reduced ability to repay debts and fulfil other
obligations, and loss in future profit.

The Government is not responsible for any loss that SES ASTRA suffers (not attributable to the

Government or to SES ASTRA) if the economic conditions under which it operates change dramatically in a
manner which could not have been reasonably foreseen at the time the Concession or the New Concession was
granted. However, if such a change occurs, SES ASTRA has the right to require that the Cahier des Charges be
revised to reflect the new circumstances. If the Government refuses or if SES ASTRA reasonably considers the
proposed amendment to be insufficient, SES ASTRA may terminate the concession on 12 months’ notice
without liability to the Government.

_Withdrawal of Concession_

The Concession or the New Concession may only be withdrawn by the Government in accordance with

Article 20(4) of the Electronic Media Law: (a) if the conditions required for obtaining it are no longer met; or
(b) if the obligations entered in the specifications are not respected; or (c) if it is not regularly exploited, in
accordance with the terms and conditions. Under the terms of the Concession and the New Concession, the
Government may withdraw the concession in whole or in part if SES ASTRA remains in breach of the
concession or _Cahier des Charges_ after notice from the Government to remedy the specified breach within a
reasonable time set by the state. A withdrawal requires the Government to request SES ASTRA and the
commissioner to present their views in writing. The Government may also deprive SES ASTRA of all or part of
the exclusive rights if SES ASTRA fails to continuously and regularly exploit the concession at an optimum
level to obtain long-term maximum financial profitability. The procedure applicable is the same as for a
withdrawal.

Upon the withdrawal of the concession by reason of a breach of the Concession Agreement or the New

Concession Agreement, or of the associated Cahier des Charges, SES ASTRA will forfeit all rights associated
with the Concession and the Government may seek to become the owner of the ASTRA satellites, control
facilities and other equipment and be substituted as a party to any agreements necessary for the exploitation of
the Concession. SES ASTRA will be entitled to fair and equitable indemnification before any property rights are
so transferred.

SES ASTRA has no reason to believe that the Government has grounds for or intends to withdraw the

Concession or the New Concession.

**_The United States_**

_FCC Regulation and Licences_

SES AMERICOM holds FCC authorisations for the following operational satellites at the following

nominal orbital locations utilising the specified frequency bands:

**Nominal Orbital Slot** **Operational Satellite(s)** **Frequency Bands**

37.5°W.L. AMC-12 (also known as NSS-10) C-band

72°W.L. AMC-3 C- and Ku-bands

83°W.L. AMC-18 C-band

85°W.L. AMC-16 Ka-band

87°W.L. SES-2 C- and Ku-bands

101°W.L. SES-1 C- and Ku-bands

103°W.L. SES-3 C- and Ku-bands

105°W.L. AMC-15 Ka- and Ku-bands

105°W.L. SES-11 Ku-band

131°W.L. AMC-1 Ku-band and TT&C in C-band

131°W.L. AMC-11 C-band

135°W.L. AMC-4 C- and Ku-bands

1359°W.L. AMC-8 C-band

139°W.L. AMC-6 C-band

SES AMERICOM’s FCC licences are subject to compliance with the terms and conditions therein.

SES AMERICOM must obtain prior FCC approval before modifying its licensed operations. The licences are
also subject to modification by the FCC on its own motion under Section 316 of the U.S. Communications Act
of 1934, as amended (Communications Act), but only after reasonable notice to the licencee and an opportunity
to protest. The burden of justifying any such modification is on the FCC. FCC licences may not be assigned or
transferred to another party without prior FCC approval.

The FCC typically issues each space station licence for an initial term expiring 15 years after the

commencement of the operation of a satellite. FCC policy allows a space station licencee to replace an
operational satellite that is nearing the end of its useful life with a new satellite, assuming the licencee continues
to meet applicable FCC requirements. At the end of a licence term, a satellite typically is allowed to continue
operations for additional time based on remaining fuel life, either through an extension of the licence term or
temporary authority granted by the FCC. The FCC also generally will grant authority for a satellite to be moved
to a vacant orbital position after launch of its replacement so that it can be operated until the end of its useful
life.

Various SES entities including Americom, and O3b (collectively **_SES licencees) also hold FCC_**

authorisations to operate earth stations in the U.S. These earth station licences are granted on a relatively routine


-----

basis, subject to FCC rules regarding transmission to or reception from satellites, and interference coordination
with other parties.

In March 2020, the FCC adopted a Report and Order reassigning the 3700-4000 MHz band from FSS

to terrestrial flexible use within the contiguous United States (CONUS). The Report and Order established a
time frame during which eligible satellite operators, including SES, must relocate services from the reassigned
portion of the spectrum to the 4000-4200 MHz band. The deadline for relocating services is 5 December 2025,
but all eligible satellite operators elected to accelerate clearing in two phases in return for defined accelerated
relocation payments. By electing to accelerate clearing, SES must clear services from the 3700-3820 MHz by 5
December 2021, and from the 3820-4000 MHz by 5 December 2023.

SES AMERICOM is required to submit periodic reports to the FCC providing information about its

operations.

_U.S. Market Access_

New Skies Satellites B.V. (New Skies), SES Satellites (Gibraltar) Ltd. (SES Gibraltar), SES DTH do

Brasil Ltda (SES DTH Brasil) and SES-17 S.à r.l. have been granted U.S. market access by the FCC for a
number of satellites licensed by The Netherlands, the United Kingdom on behalf of Gibraltar, and Brazil. They
include:

**Nominal Orbital Slot** **Operational Satellites** **Frequency Bands**

20°W.L. NSS-7 C-band

22°W.L. SES-4 C- and Ku-bands

40.5°W.L. SES-6 C- and Ku-bands

47.5°W.L. SES-14 C- and Ku-bands

67°W.L. SES-10 Ku-band

67°W.L. SES-17 Ku- and Ka-bands

105°W.L. SES-11 C-band

125°W.L. AMC-21 Ku-band

129.15°W.L. SES-15 Ku-, Ka-, L- and C-band

169.5°W.L. NSS-6 Ku-band

177°W.L. NSS-9 C-band

In addition, both QuetzSat-1 and Ciel-2 are authorised to serve the U.S. market through blanket earth

station licences held by a customer. O3b Limited also has market access authority using its non-geostationary
satellite constellation of 20 satellites operating at 8,062 km in MEO in the Ka-band.

_FCC Regulatory Fees_

In 2020, the FCC revised its regulatory fee rules to require operators that hold satellite market access

authority pay the same annual regulatory fee as operators that hold a U.S. satellite licence. In 2020, the satellite
fee was $98,125 and the fee paid by earth station licensees was $560. While the fee for individual satellites


-----

decreased, due to the inclusion of foreign-licensed satellites, SES’s overall fee liability increased as a result in
the FCC’s rule change.

_Foreign Ownership Restrictions_

Section 310(a) of the Communications Act precludes a foreign government or representative thereof

from directly holding any FCC radio frequency licence. The FCC is aware of SES AMERICOM’s foreign
ownership, including partial ownership by the government of Luxembourg, and does not consider SES
AMERICOM to be a foreign government or representative thereof for purposes of Section 310(a).

Section 310(b) of the Communications Act imposes restrictions on foreign ownership of FCC

common-carrier, broadcast and aeronautical service licencees. SES does not currently hold any such licences,
and therefore is not directly subject to the restrictions in Section 310(b). For SES’s FCC licences, the FCC
retains general discretion to consider foreign ownership issues as part of its public interest analysis.

On 4 April 2020, President Trump issued an Executive Order on Establishing the Committee for the

Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector. The Executive
Order formalizes a process through which FCC applications and existing licenses may be reviewed if they relate
to foreign participation in the United States telecommunications services sector. As noted above, several SES
entities incorporated outside of the United States hold authorizations to operate satellites in the United States.
Additionally, SES Americom, Inc., which holds several satellite and earth station licenses is wholly-owned by a
Luxembourg entity. These licenses and authorizations may be reviewed pursuant to the Executive Order. Any
future applications submitted by any SES entity may also be subject to review as a result of their foreign
ownership.

_Universal Service Fund_

Section 254 of the Communications Act, as amended, establishes a Universal Service Fund (USF) to

subsidize the provision of basic telecommunications service to rural and other high-cost areas. To fund this
subsidy, a USF contribution is levied on all “providers of interstate telecommunications” (with limited
exceptions). The USF contribution factor (or rate) is a percentage of gross revenue received from the provision
of U.S.-interstate and U.S.-international telecommunications. The “telecommunications” on which USF
contributions are levied include certain satellite services but not bare transponder capacity. Broadband Internet
access is also currently exempt from contributions, pending new FCC rules on how such services are to be
treated under the USF scheme upon their reclassification as “telecommunications.” This factor changes
quarterly and is 33.4 per cent. for the second quarter of 2021. SES licences and SES entities granted market
access currently pay USF contributions but does not receive any subsidy from the USF.

Since 2010, the FCC has taken a number of steps to reform the USF subsidy scheme, including

expanding it to subsidise broadband services and capping the overall size of the fund. In April 2012, the FCC
released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to reform the USF contribution scheme, which included potential
ways to broaden the USF contribution base and a new method of calculating USF contributions based on
something other than revenue (e.g., telephone numbers or IP addresses and/or number of connections). In
February 2015, the FCC reclassified broadband Internet access as a common carrier service. The FCC, however,
forbore from immediately applying existing USF rules to broadband Internet access revenues, pending its
consideration of broader USF reforms. It is uncertain how the FCC’s proposed USF reforms will impact SES’s
business, but it is possible that SES would have to pay more in USF contributions if the FCC were to re-define
the range of services subject to USF contributions, eliminate certain exemptions, or revoke its forbearance.

_U.S. Law Enforcement and National Security Requirements_

In the U.S., the Exon-Florio Amendment to the Defense Production Act (Exon-Florio), as amended,

gives the U.S. President the authority to review the acquisition of control by a foreign person of a U.S. person to


-----

determine whether the acquisition raises any national security concerns. This authority enables the U.S.
President to block or restrict a transaction if it presents national security concerns. The U.S. President has
delegated review authority to the Committee for Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). There is no
legal obligation to notify CFIUS of a transaction. SES is a foreign person within the meaning of Exon-Florio.

SES has requested CFIUS review and has received clearance for certain previous U.S. transactions,

including SES’s acquisitions of SES AMERICOM in 2001, New Skies in 2006 and its acquisition of a greater
interest in O3b in 2016. As part of these processes, the foreign ownership of SES, including partial ownership
by the government of Luxembourg, was disclosed to CFIUS. CFIUS’s prior approval of the SES AMERICOM,
New Skies and O3b transactions provides a “safe harbor” from further challenge under that provision. Future
U.S. acquisitions may be subject to CFIUS review.

_Proxy Agreement and Defense Security Clearances_

As a result of U.S. national security laws and regulations, SESGS, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SES

AMERICOM, is subject to a proxy agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD). SES, SES
AMERICOM, SESGS and the DOD are all party to the proxy agreement (the Proxy Agreement).

A proxy agreement is an instrument intended to negate or mitigate the risk of foreign ownership,

control or influence when a foreign person acquires or merges with a U.S. entity that has a facility security
clearance. A proxy agreement conveys a foreign owner’s voting rights to proxy holders, comprising the proxy
board. Proxy holders are cleared U.S. citizens approved by the U.S. government.

The DOD’s Defense Security Services, reorganised as the Defense Counterintelligence and Security

Agency (DCSA) during 2019, required that SESGS enter into a proxy agreement because SESGS is indirectly
owned by SES, a foreign company, and SESGS has classified contracts with DOD which contain certain
proscribed information. The Proxy Agreement enables SESGS to participate in classified contracts with the U.S.
government. The Proxy Agreement can be terminated prior to the end of its five-year period if DCSA
determines that it is no longer necessary, if there has been a violation of its terms or if requested by SES
AMERICOM and SESGS. The Proxy Agreement was subject to renewal upon agreement with DCSA during
2019. The Proxy Agreement is executed by the SES parties. Final DCSA signature of the Proxy Agreement is
pending. In the interim, the Proxy Agreement remains in force.

As a result of the Proxy Agreement, strict limitations are placed on the information that may be shared

and the interaction that may occur between SESGS, SES AMERICOM and SES. DCSA monitors compliance
with the Proxy Agreement by, at a minimum, reviewing SESGS’ activities on an annual basis.

Security clearances must be sought and maintained with the issuing authority in order to participate in

classified U.S. government programmes. Failure to maintain security clearances, material violations of the terms
of security clearances or loss of required security clearances or of the Proxy Agreement may result in SESGS’
inability to satisfy existing obligations under any classified U.S. government contracts, termination by the U.S.
government of classified contracts with SESGS and the inability to participate in new classified programmes.
Any material violations of U.S. law by SES, SES AMERICOM or its subsidiary holding security clearances
could prevent SES and its subsidiaries from holding security clearances and could result in SES, SES
AMERICOM and their subsidiaries being barred from U.S. government contracts, including unclassified
contracts, and they could be subject to civil or criminal enforcement actions and penalties.

_U.S. Export Controls and Sanctions Regulations_

The U.S. Commerce Department regulates the export and re-export of commercial communications

satellites and most satellite-related components, subsystems, software and technology under the Export
Administration Act following the implementation of export control reform in November 2014. The Commerce
Department also regulates exports of certain network equipment, including earth stations. Exports of these items


-----

and related technology from the U.S., and their subsequent re-transfer outside the U.S. may require licensing by
the Commerce Department. For overseas launches of U.S. satellites and foreign-manufactured satellites
containing regulated U.S.-origin components, the launch location and launch-related technical arrangements
require approval by the U.S. Department of State pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act. The timing of the
receipt of licences from the Commerce Department or State Department can be difficult to predict. Licences are
often issued with commercially significant conditions and restrictions, and some launch locations that may have
pricing or other advantages may not be approved.

These licensing requirements affect technical cooperation among SES entities. They also affect SES’s

satellite procurement and launch activities. In engaging in satellite-related export activities in the U.S. and in
sourcing satellites, satellite-related hardware, technology and services in the U.S., there can be no guarantee that
requisite export licences will be obtained in a timely fashion, that those licences will permit transfer of all items
requested, that launches will be permitted in locations that the Group may prefer or that licences, when granted,
will not contain conditions or restrictions that pose significant commercial or technical problems. Such
occurrences could delay the launch of future satellites. The licensing requirements also affect SES’s ability to
ship network equipment to customers. There can be no guarantee that the necessary export licences will be
obtained in a timely fashion or that the required export will be approved, which could impact SES’s ability to
provide service and collect revenue.

As an international company with subsidiaries in its countries of operations, SES is subject to the

financial and trade sanctions laws of the jurisdictions where it operates, including the following:

- the Arms Export Control Act, implemented by ITAR and administered by the U.S. State Department;

- the Export Administration Act/International Emergency Economic Powers Act, implemented by the
Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and administered by the U.S. Commerce Department; and

- the sanctions laws, executive orders and related regulations, including those administered by the U.S.
Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).

These laws impose restrictions on SES’s ability to do business in, or export hardware to, certain

countries or specific entities. In certain cases, SES may be able to obtain authorisation from the relevant
sanctioning country in order to provide service that would otherwise be subject to sanctions; however, there is
no guarantee that such authorisation will be granted. As a result, SES may be required to forgo commercial
opportunities that are subject to sanctions.

U.S. sanctions laws and regulations administered by OFAC apply directly to the activities of the

Group’s U.S. subsidiaries and U.S. persons employed by the Group. Certain of the Group’s U.S. subsidiaries
have customers in jurisdictions where sanctions apply, but in each case the activities are carried out pursuant to
licences granted by OFAC and other relevant U.S. government authorities or in compliance with U.S. sanctions
laws and regulations. In addition, the activities of the Group’s non-U.S. subsidiaries directly or indirectly in
sanctioned countries or with persons named on the Specially Designated Nationals list maintained by OFAC
(the SDN list) could put the Group at risk for any resulting violation of such laws and regulations. The Group
has policies and systems in place designed to monitor the Group’s activities and to prevent the Group from
engaging in prohibited activities or dealing with entities on the SDN list. Failure to obtain or maintain required
export or sanctions authorisations or failure to comply with applicable export control and sanctions laws and
regulations could have a material adverse effect on business. This may render it difficult or impossible to obtain
the necessary licences for exports related to satellites, launch services, TT&C, and equipment. Additionally,
failure of SES’s vendors or suppliers to obtain the necessary export authorisations could affect SES and its
subsidiaries’ and affiliates’ ability to acquire, launch or operate satellites or provide service to customers.


-----

Within the last five years, SES and its subsidiaries have not filed disclosures with the U.S. State

Department’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) regarding possible violations of the ITAR.

In June 2016, O3b Networks USA, LLC, which became a subsidiary of SES on 1 August 2016, filed a

notice of voluntary disclosure to the Commerce Department regarding a potential unauthorised export to the
United Nations in Sudan. The final report was filed on 5 December 2016, and O3b received notice from the
Commerce Department on 12 January 2017 that it would close the matter without issuing penalties.

On 1 September 2016, SES filed a notice of voluntary disclosure to the Commerce Department

regarding a potential unauthorised hardware export to Germany. An internal review was completed and a final
voluntary disclosure report was filed on 29 March 2017. The Commerce Department issued a warning letter on
26 June 2018 closing the matter without issuing penalties. On 19 March 2020, O3b USA Networks LLC
submitted an initial notice of voluntary self-disclosure to the Commerce Department identifying a potential
violation of the EAR. Specifically, O3b may have released export controlled information to a Syrian national
hired to provide support on a contract basis without obtaining prior authorization from the Commerce
Department. SES conducted an internal review and concluded that its release of technology to the Syrian
national did not violate the EAR. O3b submitted a report to the Commerce Department on 16 September 2020
which in turn closed the matter without issuing penalties on 23 November 2020.

SES submitted an initial notice of voluntary self-disclosure to OFAC on 23 May 2017 concerning

potential compliance concerns in connection with a contract that MX1 (formerly RR Media and acquired by
SES on 6 July 2016) entered into with a United Kingdom entity in July 2015, to transfer content produced by an
Iranian entity subject to U.S. sanctions. SES filed its final report with OFAC on 5 June 2019 and received notice
from OFAC on 25 October 2019 that it would close the matter without issuing penalties.

On 10 July 2019, SES S.A. filed an initial notification of voluntary self-disclosure to OFAC concerning

potential compliance concerns in connection with satellite and related support services provided to maritime
customers that in turn resold those services to ships either owned or controlled by sanctioned entities or
operating in sanctioned territorial waters. SES conducted an internal investigation of this matter and provided
OFAC with a full voluntary self-disclosure report on 17 June 2020. MX1 Inc. submitted an initial notice of
voluntary self-disclosure to the U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Antiboycott Compliance (OAC) on 21
July 2020. Specifically, MX1 Inc. entered into two commercial contracts which contain provisions which may
violate the EAR antiboycott provisions concerning Israel. SES recently completed its internal review of the
matter and is preparing its final report for submission to the OAC.

**_The Netherlands_**

On 16 November 1998, the government of The Netherlands issued New Skies Satellites N.V. (in 2004

changed to New Skies Satellite B.V. or **_New Skies) a Licence Letter setting forth the rights of New Skies to_**
exploit geostationary arc orbital locations and associated frequencies in accordance with ITU obligations,
including the ITU Radio Regulations. In compliance with applicable laws and regulations of The Netherlands
and countries in which services are provided, New Skies has located operational satellites at the following
orbital locations:

**Nominal Orbital Slot** **Frequency Bands**

20°W.L. C- and Ku-bands

22°W.L. C- and Ku-bands


40.5°W.L.

47.5°W.L.

-----

**Nominal Orbital Slot** **Frequency Bands**

50.5°E.L. C- and Ku-bands

108.2°E.L. Ku-band

131°W.L. Ku-band

169.5°W.L. Ku-band

177°W.L. C- and Ku-bands

An SES Gibraltar licensed satellite is operated at the 108.2 ° E.L orbital location.

New Skies is subject to the provisions of The Netherlands Telecommunications Act as amended (the

**_NTA). The NTA does not require a licence for the operation of activities that New Skies performs in The_**
Netherlands and for the exploitation of satellite frequencies. New Skies notifies The Netherlands government
and requests updates to the Licence Letter in advance of the launch or modification of satellites at particular
orbital locations. There is no guarantee that The Netherlands government will approve such requests. Denial of
such requests could have a material adverse effect on SES’s business. The Radiocommunications Agency
(Agentschap Telecom) regulates the New Skies licence under the NTA and may impose penalties, or revoke or
amend the New Skies licence. New Skies is not aware of any infringements and has no reason to believe that it
is in violation of any part of its licence.

The Space Activities Act (the **_Wet Ruimtevaartactiviteiten) effective 1 January 2008 regulates space_**

activities falling under Dutch jurisdiction. New Skies operates under a licence effective 19 December 2008
pursuant to Article 3 of this Act. The Space Activities Act licence requires New Skies to ensure communications
with, control of and sufficient power to operate the space object. It also requires that New Skies operate the
space object so that it will not damage the environment in outer space and that, at the end of the object’s life,
adequate fuel supply is on board to transport the object to a proper decommissioning orbit. The Act also requires
that New Skies maintain third party liability insurance coverage of €500 million per incident with The
Netherlands government as a beneficiary. Additionally, New Skies must have the financial security to guarantee
continuity of its space activities. New Skies is required to inform The Netherlands government in advance of
launch, relocation or decommissioning of a space object or should there be technical or other changes related to
the licence, including changes of control or composition of the legal entity (licencee).

Compliance with the terms of the Space Activities Act licence is also regulated by the Radio

Communications Agency. The Radio Communications Agency conducts audits of New Skies’ operations every
four years to ensure compliance with the licence. The first audit concluded in December 2008. The 2012, 2016
and 2020 audits were successfully concluded.

The Space Activities Act enables the revocation of the licence if New Skies fails to comply with the

Space Activities Act or the terms of the licence. The licence may also be revoked for failure to comply with a
treaty or binding decisions of an international institution, or if there is good reason to believe that maintenance
of the licence will jeopardise the safety of persons or goods, the space environment, public order or national
security. The regulator also has authority to amend the licence rather than revoke it, and may require certain
actions prior to revocation to ensure safety of people, goods and the environment. Failure to comply with the
licence may result in financial penalties of up to €450,000 or 10 per cent. of the annual sales of New Skies,
whichever is greater. The penalty is required to be commensurate with the seriousness of the violation, degree of


-----

fault and duration of the infringement. There is a five-year statute of limitations on infringements and the Space
Activities Act provides for a process under which parties may contest penalties or administrative actions against
them. New Skies has no reason to believe that it is in violation of its licence and is not aware of any
infringements.

**_Germany_**

SES ASTRA operates parts of satellites at the 23.5°E.L. and 28.5°E.L. orbital locations under German

frequency rights assigned by the German “Bundesnetzagentur” to SES ASTRA.

SES ASTRA has operations at 23.5°E.L. with ASTRA 3B using German rights and Luxembourg

rights. In addition, SES has procured and operates three satellites at 28.2ºE.L./28.5ºE.L. under German and
Luxembourgish rights.

**_The United Kingdom and Gibraltar_**

SES Gibraltar, a company formed under the laws of Gibraltar, and a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary

of SES, has established and has operational satellites at the following orbital slots and associated frequency
bands under the authority of the Gibraltar Regulatory Authority (GRA) and ITU satellite network filings
submitted by the United Kingdom on behalf of Gibraltar:

**Nominal Orbital Slot** **Frequency Bands**

105°W.L. C-band

108.2°E.L. Ku- and Ka-bands

125°W.L. Ku-band

129°W.L. Ku- and Ka-bands

Because Gibraltar is an overseas territory of the United Kingdom, satellites authorised by Gibraltar are

notified to the ITU by the United Kingdom. The satellite licensing procedures followed by Gibraltar are
substantially similar to the procedures followed by the United Kingdom. Like the United Kingdom, Gibraltar
does not issue space station licences. Rather, the United Kingdom and Gibraltar defer to the international
frequency coordination process dictated by the ITU Radio Regulations. The ITU satellite network filings for
SES’s orbital slots and frequencies that are submitted by the United Kingdom on behalf of Gibraltar lists SES
Gibraltar as the operating entity.


-----

SES Gibraltar also holds licences issued by the GRA pursuant to the Outer Space Act of 1986 (OSA) (a United
Kingdom statute extended to Gibraltar by the Outer Space Act of 1986 (Gibraltar) Order 1996) for the AMC-18,
AMC-21, NSS-11, SES-7, SES-9 and SES-15 satellites. The OSA licences authorise the launch and/or operation
of the satellite. The OSA as applied to Gibraltar is intended to secure compliance with the United Kingdom’s
international obligations with respect to the launching and operation of space objects and the carrying on of
other activities in outer space by persons connected with Gibraltar. A licence issued pursuant to the OSA, as
extended to Gibraltar, is not a radio-communication licence and does not grant authority to use particular orbital
positions or ITU-registered frequencies. The OSA licence allows the regulatory authorities of Gibraltar to
conduct due diligence on, for example, the relevant contracts with the satellite manufacturer, launch services
provider and insurer(s), in order to ensure that the satellite to be launched will be in accordance with the United
Kingdom’s international treaty obligations. An OSA licence is conditioned upon maintaining adequate third
party liability insurance coverage for the satellite.

**_Isle of Man_**

SES, through its Isle of Man entity, SES Satellite Leasing Limited (SES Leasing), has obtained various

launch licences from the United Kingdom Space Agency (UKSA). Prior to the satellite launch that it has
procured, SES Leasing must obtain a licence from the UKSA pursuant to the OSA (the United Kingdom statute
extended to the Isle of Man by the Outer Space Act 1986 (Isle of Man) Order 1990), which authorises the launch
of the satellite. The OSA as applied is intended to secure compliance with the international obligations of the
United Kingdom with respect to the launch of space objects and the carrying on of other activities in outer space
by persons connected with the Isle of Man. More specifically, the UKSA will not issue a licence unless it is
satisfied that activities authorised by the licence will not:

- jeopardise public health or the safety of persons or property;

- be inconsistent with the international obligations of the United Kingdom or Isle of Man; or

- impair the national security of the United Kingdom or Isle of Man.

The licence issued pursuant to the OSA is not a radio-communication licence and does not grant

authority to use particular orbital slots or frequencies.

In order to obtain an OSA licence, SES Leasing may need to provide the UKSA with access to relevant

documents such as the contracts with the satellite manufacturer, the launch services provider and the insurer(s).
This is in order to ensure compliance with the United Kingdom’s international treaty obligations (particularly
with respect to launch, maintenance in orbit and disposal of satellites and their associated risks).

SES Leasing may not launch (or procure the launch of) a satellite, operate a satellite or conduct any

other activity in outer space from the Isle of Man without appropriate licences which generally contain various
conditions. Failure to comply with these conditions could result in a loss of the licence.

**_Bermuda_**

In 2013, the Bermuda Ministry of Economic Development and the Bermuda Regulatory Authority (the

**_BRA) granted to Satellite Ventures (Bermuda) Ltd. (SVBL) (formerly SES Satellites (Bermuda) Ltd.). an SES_**
joint venture incorporated under the laws of Bermuda, the rights to occupy the orbital position 96.2°W.L. and
develop the corresponding Ku-band BSS frequency bands (12.2-12.7 GHz, 17.3-17.8 GHz). The 96.2°W.L.
orbital position is assigned to Bermuda pursuant to the Appendix 30/30A Region 2 Plan of the ITU and the
associated rights were granted to SVBL as a result of an application by SVBL to the BRA. SVBL is obliged to
report regularly to the BRA on the development and use of spectrum at the 96.2°W.L. orbital position and to
make fee payments based on the use of spectrum. The right of Bermuda and SVBL to occupy and develop the
Ku BSS frequency bands at the 96.2°W.L. orbital position has been historically disputed by a third party,


-----

Spectrum Five LLC. SES and SVBL have successfully defended all such claims. SES is not aware of any
current activities by Spectrum Five LLC to continue the dispute, however, there can be no assurance that it will
not take such actions in the future.

SVBL’s operations at 96.2°W.L. are subject to the applicable provisions of a Licence, a Certificate of

Compliance, a Certificate of Competence, a Certificate of Coordination issued by the BRA, an Orbital Resource
Use Agreement entered into between Bermuda and SVBL, Bermuda’s Telecommunications Act 1986, the
Satellite Network Notification and Coordination Regulations 2007, as well as the Radio Regulations of the ITU,
international treaties, laws, resolutions, orders, bulletins, agreements, decrees, standards and other applicable
regulatory, legal and administrative instruments.

Because Bermuda is an overseas territory of the United Kingdom, satellites licensed by Bermuda are

notified to the ITU by the United Kingdom. Except for its notification role, the United Kingdom government
does not regulate the provision of services by SVBL.

**_Jersey_**

The operation of the O3b constellation is subject to the regulatory authority of Jersey and the United

Kingdom. As a British Crown Dependency, Jersey’s space and ITU activities are handled by the United
Kingdom. Accordingly, the UKSA is responsible for licensing O3b’s space activities under the OSA. The
UKSA will not issue a licence unless it is satisfied that activities authorised by the licence will not:

- jeopardise public health or the safety of persons or property;

- be inconsistent with the international obligations of the United Kingdom or the Bailiwick of Jersey; or

- impair the national security of the United Kingdom or the Bailiwick of Jersey.

The UKSA has issued licences to O3b for O3b’s first twenty satellites, and application will be made to

the UKSA for the next-generation O3b mPOWER constellation.

O3b’s use of spectrum is regulated by Ofcom. The United Kingdom does not issue licences for satellite

use of spectrum. O3b brought into use its assigned frequencies prior to the deadline of 23 October 2014.

O3b’s MEO network today operates via a number of gateway earth station facilities located around the

world: Vernon, Texas and Sunset Beach, Hawaii in the United States; Nemea, Greece and Sintra, Portugal in
Europe; Lurín, Peru; Hortolandia, Brazil; Hawkesbay, Pakistan; and Dubbo and Perth, Australia. O3b’s
gateways in Hawaii, Greece, Australia (Perth) and Peru perform TT&C as well as communications functions for
the O3b satellite system. All of O3b’s gateways have received applicable licences and permits.

In the 18.8-19.3 GHz and 28.6-29.1 GHz band, O3b must coordinate with all prior filed satellite

networks. O3b expects to be able to coordinate to prevent harmful interference to such networks. In the 17.818.6 GHz and 27.6-28.4 GHz bands, O3b must protect geostationary satellite networks irrespective of O3b’s
ITU filing dates. O3b must also coordinate with all non-geostationary Ka-band satellite networks filed ahead of
it regardless of the frequency bands being used. According to Ofcom procedures, O3b must also complete
coordination with operators that have United Kingdom ITU filings. In most of these cases, there is a mixed
priority situation where both parties have ITU priority over the other for some of their frequencies or filings.

In some countries, terrestrial operators may use parts of O3b’s Ka-band spectrum. This may preclude

the use of overlapping O3b frequencies, except in accordance with applicable regulatory rules or unless
frequency coordination with terrestrial operators can be completed.

**_France_**


-----

On 8 September 2020, the French Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Recovery authorised SES

Networks Satellites SARL (formerly O3BNext Lux SARL) to operate a non-geostationary satellite system using
the frequency assignments in 17.8-18.6 GHz, 18.8-20.2 GHz downlink and 27.5-30.0 GHz in certain ITU
satellite network filings submitted by France. The authorisation was issued for a period of 20 years, subject to
the terms and conditions specified in the authorisation and the relevant provisions of the French Posts and
Electronic Communications Code. This authorisation and the French ITU filings will be used together with the
O3b United Kingdom ITU filings – see “Jersey” above – for the operation of some of the existing O3b satellites
and for the Company’s next-generation mPOWER MEO constellation launching in 2021.

**_Mexico_**

In 2004, Mexico’s Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) granted to QuetzSat, a wholly
owned SES affiliate incorporated under the laws of Mexico, a concession to occupy orbital position 77°W.L.
and develop its corresponding frequency bands (12.2-12.7 GHz, 17.3-17.8 GHz) in the Broadcasting Satellite
Service (Ku-BSS), including the rights to broadcast and receive signals (all such rights under the concession
hereinafter referred to as “market access”). The 77°W.L. orbital position is assigned to Mexico pursuant to the
Appendix 30/30A Region 2 Plan of the ITU, and the related concession was awarded to QuetzSat following its
successful bid at auction. The concession is for a renewable term of 20 years.

QuetzSat’s operations at 77°W.L. are subject to the applicable provisions of the following: its

concession, including the conditions set forth in the concession and its technical annexes; Mexico’s Federal Law
of Telecommunications and Broadcasting as amended in 2014 (see below) and Regulations of Communication
via Satellite of Mexico; the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States; the Radio Regulations of the
ITU; international treaties; laws; resolutions; orders; bulletins; agreements; decrees; official Mexican standards
and other regulatory, legal or administrative provisions issued by the Mexican government.

In 2013, Mexico addressed a major reform of its Constitution and Federal Telecommunications

regulations. Pursuant to the new Federal Law of Telecommunications and Broadcasting (the **_LFTR), all_**
concessions for the use of radio-frequencies are issued by the regulator, the Federal Institute of
Telecommunications (IFT). The reform included a relaxation of foreign investment limitations in
telecommunications, from 49 per cent. to 100 per cent. QuetzSat’s concession is considered a
telecommunications service under the new law so 100 per cent. of foreign investment is authorised.

Pursuant to its concession QuetzSat is required to make semi-annual payments for fees based on the use

of frequencies for the provision of service under the concession and file annual audited financial statements.
Moreover consistent with the conditions established under the concession, QuetzSat reserves a portion of
satellite capacity in each frequency band for use by the state for national security networks and for social
services, with coverage of all of the national territory.

With respect to system operations, QuetzSat must provide SCT with any information or resources

required to conclude the international coordination process or any other process required for operation of the
satellite system. QuetzSat is responsible for satellite control and operations. As required by the concession, the
main and alternate satellite system control and operation centres are established and maintained in Mexican
territory. QuetzSat is capable of limiting or interrupting satellite transmissions upon IFT’s request. QuetzSat is
also obligated under the concession to maintain continuity and quality of service and to provide coverage of the
national territory.

In 2001, SCT granted to Sistemas Satelitales de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. (SSM), a wholly-owned

SES affiliate incorporated under the laws of Mexico, a concession for rights to transmit and receive frequencies
associated with foreign satellites that cover and provide service within Mexican territory, for a term of ten years.
This authorisation was renewed in 2011 for a term of ten years. To date, SSM is authorised to offer capacity on
21 satellites and the O3b satellite network in Mexico under this concession.


-----

On 7 January 2019, in accordance with the LFTR, SSM was awarded by IFT an authorisation to

transmit and receive frequencies associated with foreign satellites that cover and provide service within Mexican
territory. This authorisation replaces the original concession and includes the same satellites previously covered
under such original concession.

Consistent with Mexican law prior to the recent reform, majority ownership in SSM is held by a

Mexican entity. SSM complies with obligations to make monthly reports on the use of satellite capacity on each
of the satellites listed on its concession, and to make semi-annual payments for fees based on the use of
frequencies for the provision of service under the concession. Pursuant to its concession, SSM files annual
audited financial statements.

The QuetzSat and SSM concessions and authorisations allow the provision of satellite capacity only

and do not authorise provision of end-user services. Rather, QuetzSat and SSM must each ensure that it
contracts with customers which are duly authorised holders of concessions or other permits or authorisations to
provide services to end-users. Contracts for the provision of space segment to customers must be approved in
advance by the regulator IFT.

In May 2017, SES Telecomunicaciones de México S. de R.L. de C.V. (SES Telecomunicaciones), a

wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of SES, received a _concesión única (“sole concession”) which permits SES_
Telecomunicaciones to provide managed satellite services in Mexico.

The SES Mexican concessionaires are subject to the laws and regulations of Mexico. QuetzSat and

SSM are also subject to the laws and regulations of countries to, from or within which QuetzSat or SSM provide
services. Such laws and regulations may limit or prohibit QuetzSat’s or SSM’s ability to sell services in certain
markets.

Mexico, the countries served by QuetzSat or SSM, or their regulatory authorities may adopt new laws,

policies or regulations, or change their interpretation of existing laws, frequency allocations, policies or
regulations, which could cause existing authorisations to be changed or cancelled, require QuetzSat, SSM or
SES Telecomunicaciones to incur additional costs or otherwise adversely affect operations or revenue. If
QuetzSat, SSM or SES Telecomunicaciones fail to remain compliant with the terms of its concession or should
QuetzSat, SSM or SES Telecomunicaciones be unable to obtain any necessary government approvals, such
failure could delay or prevent QuetzSat, SSM or SES Telecomunicaciones from offering some or all of its
services.

**_Brazil_**

In 2014, Brazil’s National Telecommunication Agency (Anatel) granted SES DTH do Brasil Ltda.

(SES DTH do Brasil), a SES affiliate incorporated under the laws of Brazil, concessions to occupy orbital
positions 48[°]W.L. and 64[°]W.L., and develop the corresponding FSS and BSS frequency bands. The related
concessions were awarded to SES DTH do Brasil following its successful bid at an auction. In 2020, SES DTH
do Brasil returned its licence to develop the BSS frequency bands at 64°W.L to Anatel. The concession to
occupy 48°W.L. is for a renewable term of 15 years.

SES DTH do Brasil’s operations at 48°W.L. are subject to the following: its concession, including the

conditions set forth in the concession and its technical annexes; applicable provisions of Brazil’s Federal
Telecommunications Law and Regulations of Communication via Satellite of Brazil; the Radio Regulations of
the ITU; laws; resolutions; orders; agreements; and other regulatory, legal or administrative provisions issued by
the Brazilian government.

With respect to system operations, SES DTH do Brasil must provide Anatel with any information or

resources required to conclude the international coordination process or any other process required for operation
of the satellite system. SES DTH do Brasil assumes responsibility for satellite control and operations. As


-----

required by the concession, the main satellite system control and operation centres will be established and
maintained in Brazil. Such centres will be capable of limiting or interrupting satellite transmissions upon
Anatel’s request. SES DTH do Brasil is also obligated under the concession to maintain continuity and quality
of service, to provide coverage of national territory and to dedicate to the Brazilian territory 25 per cent. of the
total transponders of the satellite that will occupy the 47.5°W.L. (previously the 48°W.L. orbital position prior
to amendment by Anatel dated 20 December 2017) orbital position. SES-14 was launched on 25 January 2018,
is located at 47.5°W.L. and serves the Latin America region.

In addition, New Skies, SES AMERICOM, SES ASTRA SA and SES ASTRA AB, through New Skies

Satellites Ltda (New Skies Ltda), a Brazilian entity, have been granted Brazil market access for the following
operational satellites at the following orbital locations:

**Nominal Orbital Slot** **Frequency Bands**

20[°]W C- and Ku-bands

22[°]W C- and Ku-bands

40.5[°]W C- and Ku-bands (AP30B)

5[°]E C-band


67[ °]W

67.1[°]W


Ku-band

Ka-band


O3b Limited, through O3b Networks (Brasil) Ltda (O3b Networks Ltda), a Brazilian entity, has been

granted market access using its non-geostationary MEO satellite constellation. In March 2019, New Skies Ltda.
was designated as a second legal representative for O3b Limited in Brazil authorizing it to provide MEO
capacity within the Brazilian territory.

SES DTH do Brasil, New Skies Ltda and O3b Networks Ltda are obligated to make semi-annual

reports on the use of satellite capacity at the authorised orbital positions listed above and to make annual
payments for fees based on the maintenance of licences in Brazil.

The concessions held by SES DTH do Brasil, New Skies Ltda, and O3b Networks Ltda authorise

market access only and do not authorise provision of end-user services. Rather, SES DTH do Brasil, New Skies
Ltda, and O3b Networks Ltda must each ensure that it contracts only with duly authorised holders of
concessions or other authorisations to provide telecommunication services to end-users.

SES holds authorisations to provide telecommunications services, separate from its market access

concessions. SES DTH do Brazil in June 2016 was granted two concessions for the provision of
telecommunication services to special aeronautical services. One concession is for the provision of fixed
telecommunication service referred to as Private Limited Service (SLP), which allows SES to provide
telecommunication services (IP connectivity) to corporate VSAT networks using the Ku- or Ka-bands. The SLP
concession is necessary to connect the ground section of the network. The second concession is for the
provision of Global Mobile Satellite Service (SMGS), which allows SES to provide IP connectivity to VSATs
on the move (e.g., airplanes, ships) using the Ku- or Ka-bands. Both concessions are necessary for the provision
of aeronautical services. The SMGS concession allows SES to connect VSAT antennas on airplanes to the
satellite. In 2018, SES was granted a licence to provide multimedia services (SCM), which allow SES to provide
internet connectivity to its customers and/or end-users. O3b Teleport Serviços (Brasil) Ltda (O3b Teleport
**_Serviços Ltda) also holds an SLP authorisation, which allows it to provide fixed telecommunication service to_**
telcos, ISPs, and fixed offshore oil platforms, as well as to conduct gateway operations, using the Ka-band. Each
concession was granted for an unlimited term and cover all of Brazil.


-----

Brazilian regulatory authorities may adopt new laws, policies or regulations, or change their

interpretation of existing laws, policies or regulations, which could cause existing authorisations to be changed
or cancelled, require SES DTH do Brasil, New Skies Ltda or O3b Teleport Serviços Ltda to incur additional
costs or otherwise adversely affect operations or revenue. If SES DTH do Brasil, New Skies Ltda, or O3b
Teleport Serviços Ltda fails to remain compliant with the terms of its concession, such failure could delay or
prevent SES DTH do Brasil, New Skies Ltda or O3b Teleport Serviços Ltda from offering some or all of its
services.

**_Canada_**

Northern Americas Satellite Ventures, Inc. (NASV) is a corporation organised under the laws of the

Province of Ontario, Canada. NASV is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of SES S.A.. Prior to 30 April
2021, NASV was the direct owner of Ciel Satellite Holdings Inc. (Ciel Holdings) and was the minority partner
in Ciel Satellites Limited Partnership (Ciel). Ciel Holdings was the general partner in Ciel. On 30 April 2021,
NASV wound up Ciel Holdings. As a result of the wind up, Ciel was dissolved. Pursuant to approval from
Industry, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED), NASV became the licensee for the Canadian
spectrum licence (previously referred to as “radio licences”) permitting operation of the Ciel-2 Ku-BSS satellite
at the 129°W.L. orbital position and the radio license issued to communicate with the O3b NGSO system. In
2020, Ciel surrendered its authority to operate the Ciel-5i Ka-BSS payload on SES-2 at the 86.5°W.L. orbital
position and its authority to develop a new satellite at the 86.5°W.L. orbital position (and maintenance of
approval to develop in this location is subject to compliance with milestones).

NASV is subject to the laws of Canada and regulation by authorities of the Canadian government,

primarily ISED. NASV’s operations are subject to regulation and licensing by ISED pursuant to the
Radiocommunication Act (the Radio Act). The Radio Act empowers ISED to regulate the orderly development
and efficient operation of radio communications in Canada. ISED has the authority to issue licences, establish
standards, assign Canadian orbital slots and plan the allocation and use of the radio spectrum, including the
radio frequencies upon which satellites and earth stations depend.

NASV requires licences issued by the Minister of Industry pursuant to the provisions of the Radio Act

to operate satellites and develop radio spectrum. The Minister has broad discretion to issue these licences, to fix
terms and conditions on such licences, to amend those terms and conditions and to suspend or revoke such
licences. Terms of the licences with which NASV must comply in order to operate the licensed satellites include
public benefit commitments, the payment of annual fees, satellite coverage of all areas of Canada visible from
the orbital slot and compliance with foreign ownership restrictions applicable to holders of radio licences. ISED
issues guidelines and procedures on the spectrum licensing process which provide a framework within which
decisions under the Radio Act are made.

In addition, members of the SES Group have been granted Canadian market access for the following

operational satellites at the following orbital locations:

**Nominal Orbital Slot** **Operational Satellite(s)** **Frequency Bands**

20°W.L. NSS-7 C- and Ku-bands

22°W.L. SES-4 C- and Ku-bands

37.5°W.L. AMC-12 C-band

40.5°W.L. SES-6 C- and Ku-bands

83°W.L. AMC-18 C- bands

85°W.L. AMC-16 Ka- and Ku-bands

87°W.L. SES-2 C- and Ku-bands

101°W.L. SES-1 C- and Ku-bands

103°W.L. SES-3 C- and Ku-bands

105°W.L. AMC-15 Ka- and Ku-bands

125°W.L. AMC-21 Ku-band

129.15°W.L. SES-15 Ku- and Ka-bands

177°W.L. NSS-9 C-band

O3b Limited also has market access authority using its KA-band MEO constellation.

In August 2020, Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) published a

consultation proposing to repurpose a portion of the C-band downlink spectrum (3700-4200 MHz) to terrestrial
flexible use. There is a risk that, notwithstanding SES’s advocacy to the contrary, ISED will mandate that SES
and other C-band satellite operators clear services from a portion of the band without adequate compensation.

**_Sweden_**

SES, through its wholly-owned Swedish subsidiary SES ASTRA AB, holds the rights to use Swedish

orbital locations at 5.0°E.L. and 13°W.L. and their associated frequencies. SES ASTRA AB is permitted by PTS
to operate in the C-, Ku- (FSS and BSS) and Ka-bands on the ASTRA 4A and SES-5 satellites. SES ASTRA
AB has a space activities licence for the ASTRA 4A satellite and its frequency bands (Regeringsbeslut
N2007/8282/FIN). It also has a licence for space activities for the SES-5 satellite including the L-, Ku- (FSS and
BSS), C- and Ka-bands (Regeringsbeslut U2011/3375/F).

The Swedish National Space Board, acting on the mandate of the Ministry of Education and Research,

acts as the regulator for the launch of Swedish space objects. Outer space activities are governed by the Swedish
Law on Outer Space (Lag (1982:963) om Rymdverksamhet) of 1982. A Swedish satellite operator is required to
have a licence for space activities and to place objects in outer space. A licence for space activities is granted to
a Swedish satellite operator on a per satellite basis. A licence may be subject to conditions to be determined
upon issuance of the licence and may be revoked if the licencee violates the terms of the licence, which are also
at the discretion of the Swedish National Space Board.

A licence is required to (i) perform activities towards outer space (i.e., TT&C) and (ii) to place objects

in outer space. However, a licence is not required to receive signals from outer space.


-----

The PTS, mandated by the Ministry of Infrastructure, is the official regulator of satellite

communications and frequency use in Sweden. Currently, frequencies are coordinated with PTS in accordance
with a document entitled “Routines for Frequency Coordination,” a non-binding set of guidelines outlining the
basic procedures for coordination and allocation of satellite frequencies. The guidelines specify among other
rights and remedies that in order to submit frequency filings through the PTS, such company must be a Swedish
legal entity.

No Swedish definition of a satellite operator exists. The factors contributing to SES ASTRA AB’s

status as a Swedish satellite operator are at the discretion of the PTS and the Swedish National Space Board.

**_Andean Community_**

On 10 December 2009, the Andean Community granted exclusive rights to New Skies to operate and

commercialize 67°W.L. orbital location for an initial term of 30 years, renewable. This Andean Satellite
identified as “Simon Bolivar 2” includes Ku-band frequencies only.The Colombian Administration (on behalf of
the Andean Community) is the notifying administration responsible for the international coordination of,
interference protection of and interference resolution for the SIMON BOLIVAR 2 ITU network filing, with
New Skies obligated to participate in all coordination activities related to satellites at the orbital location.

The applicable conditions for use of the satellite are set forth in Decisions 654 and 725 of the Andean

Community. Decision 725 (“Community Authorisation for Operation and Commercialisation for Member
_Countries’ Orbit-Spectrum Resources at the 67º West Orbital Location”) mandates that New Skies determine_
prices, terms and conditions for the provision of capacity and services from the 67°W.L. orbital location, and
that New Skies has the right to retain all revenue for such capacity and services. Decision 654 (the “Regulatory
_Framework for Commercial Utilisation of Member Countries’ Orbit-Spectrum Resources”) authorises the_
Andean Community Secretary General to enter into an agreement with New Skies and provides that the
authorisation granted becomes null and void upon failure of New Skies to comply with its terms.

In February 2010, New Skies and the Andean Community signed a contract as provided in Decision

725 for the use and exploitation of orbit/spectrum resources of the Simon Bolivar 2 satellite network. In
conformity with Decision 725 and the 2010 contract, the SES-10 (Simon Bolivar 2) satellite was launched at the
67° W.L. orbital position on 30 March 2017 and standard operations on August 2017, providing replacement
capacity for AMC-4 and AMC-6. In consideration for the authorisation and pursuant to the terms of the contract,
SES must provide Andean Community Member States with a portion of the Ku-band orbit/spectrum resource at
the 67°W.L. location, in a manner consistent with technical specifications set forth in the contract. The contract
terms also include a requirement to provide a small amount of C-band capacity on an SES satellite at a separate
location.

**_The European Union_**

_Telecommunications Regulations & Audiovisual Regulations_

The European Electronic Communications Code (the EEC Code) was adopted in December 2018,

replacing the EU’s regulatory Framework for Electronic Communications (Telecoms Package).The EEC Code
covers EU spectrum policies, licensing, access/interconnection issues, universal service and consumers’ rights.
SES’s and its customers’ activities are governed by the principles of the Code, in particular those regarding
spectrum policy and those related to the procedures and conditions to authorise the delivery of wireless services
including satellite services.

The EEC Code also sets new EU objectives to provide very high capacity connectivity to everyone in

Europe by 2025 (with a minimum of 100 Mbps), and 5G communications to the main public and private
locations (cities, hospitals, schools). These still broadly follow the principle of technology neutrality, but they


-----

prioritise fibre and terrestrial wireless and also emphasize the need to govern radio spectrum in a more flexible
manner, by further promoting spectrum sharing policies.

In 2020, the EU Commission released proposed regulations on cyber-security and resilience, cross
border transfer of data and liability of B2C online (platform) services. Most recently, the EU Commission has
designed a new roadmap for the ten years to 2030 called Digital Decade for the rollout of Gigabit broadband in
Europe.

The EU also remains committed to preserving principles of freedom to establish and freedom to receive

and retransmit audiovisual media within the EU Single Market based on the Audiovisual Media Services
(AVMS) Directive, taking into account the effect of Brexit (see further below). In the EU, the “country of origin
principle” applies to the distribution of traditional TV broadcasts and on-demand services. Because satellite
transmissions are often international in nature (i.e., uplinked from one country and received in another or several
other countries), the country of origin principle avoids the cumulative burden on satellite broadcasters (or
service providers) of complying with the laws and regulations of multiple Member States.

The AVMS Directive, which was reviewed and revised in December 2018, is important to SES’s

business. To the extent the service providers whose content are transmitted via SES’s satellites are appropriately
licensed in an EU Member State, there are no additional broadcasting licensing requirements for SES. SES
undertakes to confirm that broadcasters (or service providers) transmitting via its satellites have all necessary
licences.

At midnight on 31 December 2020, the UK left the EU, based on the terms of a Trade and Cooperation

Agreement (the Agreement) concluded in December 2020 between the EU and the UK. Implementation of the
Agreement is still ongoing. Since the Agreement does not cover the audiovisual sector, UK broadcasters or
international broadcasters registered in the UK need to come under the jurisdiction of one EU member state in
order to continue broadcasting into the EU. The EU member state with jurisdiction under the AVMS Directive
would be, either (in order) the state in which the broadcaster is established, the state from which the broadcaster
is uplinking its service, or the state to which the satellite capacity appertains. Several UK broadcasters have
already brought their European broadcasting operations under the jurisdiction of an EU member state. Non-EU
broadcasters using ASTRA satellites may turn to the EU country in which the uplink is located, or the EU
country to which the satellite capacity appertains (e.g. Luxembourg, Sweden or the Netherlands, in the case of
the Group’s satellites over Europe).

_Export and Sanctions Regulations_

Certain EU export and sanctions regulations restrict SES’s ability to provide services in, or export

hardware to, certain countries or specific persons or entities. Where export licences are required, SES obtains
them from the relevant EU Member State. In certain cases, SES may be able to obtain authorisation from an EU
Member State in order to provide service that would otherwise be subject to sanctions. However, there is no
guarantee that such authorisation will be granted. As a result, SES may be required to forgo commercial
opportunities that are subject to sanctions. Failure to obtain or maintain required sanctions authorisations or
failure to comply with applicable export and sanctions laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect
on its business.

**International Telecommunication Union Filings and Coordination Procedures**

_International Regulation_

The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the U.S., The Netherlands, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, France,

Germany, Mexico, Sweden and the United Kingdom are members of the ITU. The ITU, a specialized agency of
the United Nations of which most countries in the world are members, establishes rules and regulations relating,
among other things, to the coordination of the international use of the radio frequency spectrum and orbital


-----

positions. All members of the ITU have the same rights as other members to use frequency spectrum and
corresponding orbital positions. The Group is required to comply with all provisions of the ITU Convention,
including its Radio Regulations, and other applicable international treaties to which the aforementioned
countries are parties.

_Assignment of Frequency and Orbital Resources_

Through the Radio Regulations, which are in part designed to prevent harmful interference, the ITU

supervises the use of orbital positions and associated frequencies. The Radiocommunication Bureau is the ITU’s
body which administers the ITU’s Radio Regulations. Each ITU member nation is required to register its
proposed use of orbital slots with the ITU’s Radiocommunication Bureau.

Once spectrum at an orbital slot has been requested by a country and the Radiocommunication Bureau

is notified, other countries may inform the Radiocommunication Bureau of any conflicts with their present or
proposed use of the spectrum at that orbital location. When a conflict or potential conflict is noted, countries
must negotiate in an effort to coordinate the proposed uses and resolve any interference concerns. The
Radiocommunication Bureau may be asked to assist in resolving any dispute arising in connection with
proposed uses of frequencies and orbital locations. However, no binding dispute resolution mechanism applies,
and, if there is no agreement, a satellite system will not be entitled to protection from interference under
international law. Any country may place a satellite or earth station in operation without coordination and
notification. However, if it does so the satellite or earth station is not entitled to registration in the ITU’s Master
International Frequency Register and the associated protections from harmful interference associated with such
registration.

The governments of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the U.S., The Netherlands, Brazil, Canada,

Colombia, France, Germany, Mexico, Sweden and the United Kingdom are each responsible for filing and
coordinating SES’s or its affiliates’ applications for the use of frequencies at specified orbital locations with the
Radiocommunication Bureau under the provisions of the ITU Convention. When a conflict or potential conflict
is noted in the Group’s use of an orbital slot or affecting a satellite it operates, the relevant filing administration
is responsible for negotiating to resolve any intended use or interference concerns. In many instances these
governments delegate authority to the operator, SES ASTRA, New Skies, SES AMERICOM, SES Gibraltar,
SES ASTRA AB, NASV, SES DTH do Brasil, SES Networks Satellites SARL or QuetzSat, to coordinate use of
the spectrum at an orbital location directly with other potentially affected operators. Agreements reached with
other operators are forwarded to their respective governments for ratification. Coordination between SES
AMERICOM and other U.S.-licensed operators is not subject to the ITU Radio Regulations, as it is considered a
domestic U.S. matter. As British Overseas Territories, Gibraltar and Bermuda are not members of the ITU, the
Group must make a request to the ITU to coordinate the use of certain frequencies in connection with a satellite
network to the Office of Communications (Ofcom) in the United Kingdom through the Gibraltar or Bermuda
regulatory authorities, in accordance with the international obligations of the United Kingdom as set out in the
Radio Regulations of the ITU.

The operation of satellites at all orbital slots is done in accordance with the ITU Constitution and

Convention and its Radio Regulations.

_Regulation of Earth Stations_

SES, its subsidiaries and its affiliates operate gateway and TT&C earth stations in a number of

jurisdictions including but not limited to the U.S., the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Brazil, Sweden, Gibraltar,
Bermuda, Australia, Israel, Romania, Germany and Belgium. SES or its subsidiaries and affiliates hold the
relevant earth station licences in these jurisdictions. SES also maintains authority to operate aeronautical earth
station antennas in a number of jurisdictions Fees are paid in connection with both the fixed and aeronautical
antenna applications and licences. Renewal fees and/or annual regulatory fees are also assessed on earth


-----

stations. Violations of rules applicable to earth station licensing may result in sanctions, fines, loss of
authorisations and denials of authorisations for new earth stations and for renewals of existing authorisations.

_Spectrum Reallocation_

The ITU and a number of national governments have announced or commenced efforts to find more

spectrum to support projected growth in demand for terrestrial broadband services. Typically these efforts focus
on spectrum below the frequencies that SES deploys on the Group’s satellites. In some countries, however, parts
of the C-band frequencies (3.4-3.6 GHz or 3.4-3.8 GHz) have been or will soon be designated for shared
terrestrial use, thereby inhibiting use by the Group’s satellites and limiting growth of services using these bands
in those countries. In addition, a few countries are contemplating expansion of terrestrial operations in the 3.84.2 GHz band. It is expected that pressure to designate C-band or parts of the C-band for terrestrial broadband
will continue, which could further limit the use of satellite services in this band.

More recently, there have been attempts to introduce or increase terrestrial use or “sharing” of the Ku
and Ka-band frequencies the Group uses for satellite services. A number of countries, including the U.S.,
Canada, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Chile, Japan, Australia and India have introduced or are considering
terrestrial fixed or mobile operations (to varying degrees) in portions of the Ka-band frequencies used by the
Group outside of the ITU World Radiocommunications Conference process.

The fact that the Group, and the satellite industry generally, use this spectrum extensively on its

satellites to provide services to its customers may be a bulwark against arbitrary reallocation, especially in major
markets. However, the Group cannot be certain that some countries in which it does business will not reallocate
the satellite spectrum that it uses today in favour of terrestrial services or introduce constraints on the Group’s
operations through spectrum sharing.

_Spectrum Auctions and Spectrum Fees_

A small number of countries today use, or have proposed to introduce, an auction mechanism to assign

spectrum for the provision of satellite services in their national territory. A number of other countries have
introduced, or are considering, market-based spectrum fees (e.g., based on “opportunity cost” pricing) for all
spectrum use, including satellite spectrum use. The Group cannot be certain that the use of such auctions and/or
fees will not increase. If they do, they could create significant barriers to entry and significantly increase the
Group’s costs of doing business in those countries.

_Insurance_

The Group is required by certain governments to purchase third-party liability insurance to cover

damage that may be caused by its satellites. In its insurance policy, the Group designates the governments of the
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the U.S., The Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Gibraltar, the Isle of
Man, Jersey, Mexico, Canada, Brazil and the Andean Community (including its member countries: Colombia,
Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia) as additional insured parties and pays premiums for coverage broad enough to cover
these parties against liability as a “launching state” under international conventions.

_Market Access and Authorisations of Other National Authorities_

Legal and regulatory restrictions and requirements governing satellite service vary among countries. As

a provider of satellite services and capacity, SES is subject to the national communications, space and
broadcasting laws and other regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. Many countries have
liberalized their regulations to permit entities to provide voice, data or video services using non-domestic
satellites. This trend accelerated with the implementation of commitments made by many WTO members, in the
context of the 1997 WTO Agreement on Basic Telecommunications Services, to open their home satellite
markets to greater or full competition on defined schedules. For these countries, often no approval or licence is


-----

required or, alternatively, an approval or licence is required but typically granted to the satellite operator or its
customers.

Other countries require the satellite operator to obtain a licence to provide satellite services or capacity

within their national boundaries, or otherwise place legal or de facto restrictions on market access by a foreign
satellite operator. In such markets, the provision of service from foreign-licensed satellites may be complicated
or prohibited altogether.

Some of these countries require SES to obtain licences, authorisation or approval before SES may offer

satellite services or capacity in those countries. As SES launches or relocates satellites, it seeks the requisite
licences, authorisations or approvals. There is no guarantee that such licences, authorisations or approvals will
be timely or ever granted. This would delay or prevent market access by SES.

Sometimes the only means to access a market is by selling through a third-party provider in that

country. In order to provide its services and capacity in these countries, SES must negotiate sales of service or
capacity agreements with these third parties. Third party service providers using satellites operated by SES are
also required to obtain local approvals necessary to transmit to or receive from these satellites.

In addition, the laws, regulations and practices of some countries may make it harder to compete

against a domestic or regional satellite system operator from that country. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory
approvals involves significant time and expense.

_Antitrust and Competition Laws_

SES is subject to and must comply with applicable competition laws and regulations in the jurisdictions

in which it does business. Based on market conditions and SES’s commercial interests in a particular country,
these laws and regulations may limit SES’s ability to provide service in a country. In certain cases, SES may be
required to obtain approval from the relevant governmental authority in order to provide service or complete a
transaction, merger, joint venture or other activity in which it would have a controlling interest. Depending on
how any relevant market is defined, SES may be deemed to operate in a highly concentrated market and hold
strong market positions in several countries.

As a result, there is no guarantee that competition authority approval will be granted for such

transaction or activity. In some circumstances, competition authorities may allow a venture or activity to
proceed but would place limitations or conditions upon SES’s activities. SES may be required to forego
commercial opportunities should competition authorities not allow a transaction, merger, joint venture or other
activity to proceed or should the limitations imposed by that authority be determined to be overly burdensome.

In its SES/DPC merger control decision in December 2004, the German Competition Authority

(Bundeskartellamt) found that SES held a dominant position in the market for the provision of satellite capacity
for DTH services in Germany (or the German-speaking territory). The Bundeskartellamt concluded that SES’s
satellite transponder business in Germany must comply with special, more stringent competition rules for
dominant companies. In particular, the Group must not discriminate against business partners, refuse to supply
satellite capacity without objective reasons, enter into exclusive purchase agreements with or grant loyalty
rebates to customers, or tie the sale of satellite capacity and other services.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE ISSUER AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE**

**SES**

The corporate name of SES is SES and its business name is SES. SES was incorporated under the laws

of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg on 16 March 2001 as a public limited liability company (société anonyme)
and is registered with Luxembourg Trade and Company Register under number B 81.267. SES is governed by
Luxembourg law. SES’s registered address is Château de Betzdorf, L-6815 Betzdorf (Grand Duchy of
Luxembourg) and its telephone number is + 352 710 725-1. SES is incorporated for an unlimited term.

**Share Capital**

SES has issued two classes of shares: A Shares and B Shares. Although they constitute separate classes

of shares, A Shares and B Shares carry the same rights except that (i) the B Shares, held by the Grand Duchy of
Luxembourg and by two entities wholly-owned by the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, entitle their holders to
only 40 per cent. of the dividend, or in case SES is dissolved, to 40 per cent. of the net liquidation proceeds paid
to holders of A Shares and (ii) that the B Shares are entitled to a preferential subscription right for all capital
increases of SES. Each Share, whether of A or B, is entitled to one vote. For the number of issued shares of each
class as of 17 May 2021 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this Prospectus) see
“Principal Shareholders” below.

All the Shares issued by SES are fully paid and represent capital. SES has not issued convertible

securities exchangeable securities or securities with warrant.

Other than as set out in the Articles of Association there are no acquisition rights and or obligations

over authorised but unissued capital of SES or any undertaking to increase the capital.

**_Shares in SES held by or on behalf of SES itself_**

On 31 December 2020, SES held 4,559,818 FDRs, with no par value, and with a carrying value of €77

million.

**_History of the share capital of SES for the last 3 financial years_**

On 5 April 2018, the extraordinary shareholders’ meeting of SES set the authorised share capital of

SES including the issued share capital at €790,881,300 represented by 421,803,360 A-shares and 210,901,680
B-shares and as of 5 April 2018 the subscribed capital of SES was set at €718,983,000 consisting of
575,186,400 Shares with no par value, all of which are fully paid up and divided into two categories of Shares,
383,457,600 A Shares and 191,728,800 B Shares.

**_Dividend policy_**

The Board of SES proposed a dividend of EUR 0.40 for each A class share for 2020. This dividend,

which was approved at SES’s annual general meeting on 1 April 2021, was paid to shareholders on 22 April
2021. On 25 February 2021, SES announced that it intends to maintain a minimum base dividend of EUR 0.40.

**_Description of the rights preferences and restrictions attaching to each class of existing shares_**

A Shares and B Shares constitute two separate classes of shares in SES but rank _pari passu in all_

respects save as specifically provided herein.

The A Shares and the B Shares are freely transferable.

In case of an increase of the share capital of SES by a contribution that is either in kind or in cash, the

shareholders of B Shares have a preferential subscription right for additional B Shares in order for the
proportion of one issued B Share for two issued A Shares to be maintained at all times.

B Shares are issued each time for an issuing price equal to 40 per cent. of the issuing price of a share

of A.


-----

The economic rights of one B Share compared to one A Share are 40 per cent.

SES does not have any preferred shares (meaning shares which constitute capital without voting rights

and which confer a preferential right with respect to the reimbursement of contributions) of SES outstanding and
the Articles do not provide for the issuance of such shares by SES.

**_Actions necessary to change the rights of holders of the Shares_**

A change of the rights of the holders of the Shares requires an amendment of the Articles of

Association. Amendments of the Articles of Association require shareholder consent in accordance with the
Articles and article 450-3 and 450-4 of the Luxembourg Company Law.

**_Description of any provision of the Articles of Association, statutes, charter or bylaws that would have an_**
**_effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the issuer_**

No shareholder of class A may, directly or indirectly, hold or acquire by any means more than 20 per

cent., 33 per cent. or 50 per cent. of the Shares unless he has obtained prior approval from the General Meeting
of Shareholders. Such limit will be calculated by taking into account the Shares of all classes held by a
shareholder of class A Shares. It will not apply to the shareholders issuing fiduciary certificates in agreement
with SES.

Pursuant to the Articles of Association, a shareholder or a potential shareholder who plans to acquire

by whatever means, directly or indirectly, more than 20 per cent., 33 per cent. or 50 per cent. of the Shares must
inform the Chairperson of the Board of Directors of such intention.

The Chairperson of the Board of Directors will then inform the government of the Grand Duchy of

Luxembourg of the planned acquisition, which may only be opposed by the government within three months of
receiving such information, should it determine that such an acquisition is against the general public interest.

If the government of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has not raised any opposition to the acquisition

by a shareholder or a potential shareholder of more than 20 per cent., 33 per cent. or 50 per cent. of the Shares,
the Board of Directors shall convene an extraordinary meeting of Shareholders, which may decide at a majority
provided for in article 450-3 of the Luxembourg law of 10 August 1915, as amended, regarding commercial
companies (the **_Luxembourg Company Law), to authorise the shareholder or potential shareholder to acquire_**
more than 20 per cent., 33 per cent. or 50 per cent. of the Shares. If the demanding party is a shareholder of SES,
it may attend the General Meeting of Shareholders and will be included in the count for the quorum but may not
take part in the vote.

In the event of a breach of such ownership threshold or restrictions by a person or a group of persons

acting together or under the control of one person, the ownership of Shares above the thresholds or in breach of
the relevant restriction may not be enforced _vis-à-vis SES and the Board is authorised to suspend the voting_
rights and any rights to dividends and other distributions of the non-compliant shareholder. For the purposes of
this restriction, the method of acquisition of the Shares is irrelevant.

**_An indication of the articles of association, statutes, charter or bylaws provisions, if any, governing the_**
**_ownership threshold above which shareholder ownership must be disclosed_**

In accordance with article 8 of the Luxembourg law of 11 January 2008 as amended, on transparency

obligations for issuers of securities, any shareholder or FDR holder acquiring or disposing of shares or FDRs
respectively, is required to inform SES and the _Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier within four_
trading days of the proportion of voting rights held as a result of such acquisition or disposal where that
proportion reaches, exceeds or falls below the thresholds of 5 per cent., 10 per cent., 15 per cent., 20 per cent.,
25 per cent., 33 1/3 per cent. 50 per cent. or 66 2/3 per cent.

Pursuant to the Articles of Association, a shareholder or a potential shareholder who plans to acquire

by whatever means, directly or indirectly, more than 20 per cent., 33 per cent. or 50 per cent. of the Shares of
SES must inform the Chairperson of the Board of Directors of such intention.


-----

**_Description of the conditions imposed by the memorandum and articles of association statutes, charter or_**
**_bylaws governing changes in the capital, where such conditions are more stringent than is required by law_**

In case of an increase of the share capital of SES by a contribution that is either in kind or in cash, the

shareholders holding B Shares have a preferential subscription right for additional B Shares in order for the
proportion of one issued B Share for two issued A Shares to be maintained at all times.

**Objects and Purposes**

According to Article 2 of the Articles of Association, SES’s objects and purposes are to take generally

any interest whatsoever in electronic media and to be active, more particularly, in the area of communications
via satellite. In this context, SES’s purpose is the holding of participations, in any form whatsoever, in
Luxembourg companies and foreign companies, and any other form of investment, the acquisition by purchase,
subscription, or in any other manner as well as the transfer by sale, exchange or otherwise of securities of any
kind, and the administration, control and development of its portfolio. In addition, SES may conduct all kinds of
commercial, industrial and financial business, with movable as well as with immovable assets, which it may
deem useful in the accomplishment of its purpose. SES may also hold any kind of interest, in any form, by way
of participations, guarantees or otherwise, in any Luxembourg or foreign enterprise, company or association
likely to further SES’s purpose to the best use.

**General Meetings**

Under Luxembourg Company Law, SES’s annual and/or extraordinary general meetings of

Shareholders represent the entire body of shareholders of SES. They have the widest powers, and resolutions
passed by such meetings are binding upon all shareholders, whether absent, abstaining from voting or voting
against the resolutions.

The meetings are presided over by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or, in his absence, by one of

the Vice Chairmen of the Board of Directors or, in their absence, by any other person hereto appointed by the
meeting. Any shareholder who is recorded in SES’s shareholders’ register on the 14[th] day before the meeting at
24 hours (Luxembourg time) is authorised to attend and to vote at the meeting. A shareholder may act at any
meeting by appointing a proxy who does not need to be a shareholder.

Each registered shareholder receives written notice of a General Meeting of Shareholders, including the

time of the meeting, the agenda and the draft resolutions, at least 30 days prior to the meeting. Holders of FDRs
are represented at the meeting by Banque et Caisse d’Epargne de l’Etat, Luxembourg, acting as Fiduciary. Each
FDR represents one A Share. If a holder of FDRs wants to attend the General Meeting of Shareholders in
person, that shareholder needs to convert at least one FDR into an A Share. In order to facilitate the attendance
of the meeting by FDR holders, SES pays the applicable charge for a conversion of up to 10,000 FDRs for a
short period prior to the annual general meeting for any FDR holder who is not yet a shareholder of SES.

Notice of the meeting and of the proposed agenda is published in the press. The Fiduciary circulates the

draft resolutions to both international clearing systems, Euroclear and Clearstream, allowing FDR holders to
give their voting instructions to the Fiduciary in time for the meeting. At the same time, the draft resolutions are
made available on SES’s website. Unless the Fiduciary has received specific instructions from the FDR holder,
the Fiduciary must vote in favour of the proposals submitted by the Board of Directors. One or more
shareholders owning together at least 5 per cent. of the shares of SES have the right to request to add items on
the agenda of the General Meeting of Shareholders and may deposit draft resolutions regarding items listed in
the agenda or proposed to be added to the agenda. This request will need to be made in writing (via mail or email) and received no later than the twenty–second day preceding the General Meeting of Shareholders and will
need to include a justification or draft resolution to be adopted at the General Meeting of Shareholders. The
written request must include a contact address to which SES can confirm receipt within 48 hours from the
receipt of the request. SES will then, at the latest fifteen days preceding the General Meeting of Shareholders
publish a revised agenda.

The meeting may deliberate validly only if at least half of the A Shares and at least half of the B Shares

are represented. In the event that the required quorum is not reached, the meeting must be reconvened in
accordance with the form prescribed by the Articles of Association. It may then validly deliberate without
consideration of the number of represented shares.


-----

The proceedings are held in French, but an English translation is provided by SES. A French version of

the General Meeting of Shareholders minutes and the results of the shareholders’ votes are published on SES’s
website within 15 days after the General Meeting of Shareholders. With the exception of the procedure
described above (in respect of a shareholder intending to hold more than 20 per cent., 33 per cent. or 50 per
cent., respectively, of the shares of SES), all the resolutions of the meeting are adopted by a simple majority
vote except if otherwise provided for by Luxembourg Company Law.

**_Extraordinary General Meetings_**

If the government of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has not raised any opposition to the acquisition

by a shareholder of more than 20 per cent., 33 per cent. or 50 per cent. of the Shares, the Board of Directors
shall convene an extraordinary meeting of Shareholders which may decide at a two-thirds majority as provided
for in article 450-3 of the Luxembourg Company Law, to authorise a shareholder or a potential shareholder to
acquire more than 20 per cent., 33 per cent. or 50 per cent. of the Shares.

Without prejudice to the quorum requirements, the Articles of Association may be amended with a

two-thirds majority in accordance with article 450-3 of the Luxembourg Company Law.

**_Annual General Meetings_**

The annual general meeting is held on the first Thursday in April of each year at 10.30 a.m., or if such

day is a legal holiday, on the preceding business day.

**Board of Directors**

The Board of Directors is responsible for defining SES’s strategic objectives as well as its overall

corporate plan. The Board of Directors approves, upon proposal from the Executive Committee, the annual
consolidated accounts of SES and the appropriation of results, the Group’s medium-term business plan, the
consolidated annual budget of SES and the management report to be submitted to the General Meeting of
Shareholders. It also approves major investments and is responsible _vis-à-vis shareholders and third parties for_
the management of SES, which it delegates to the Executive Committee.

Following a decision taken by the shareholders at the annual general meeting in April 2021, the Board

of Directors is composed of 11 non-executive directors. In accordance with the Articles of Association, twothirds of the Board of Directors members represent holders of A Shares and one-third of the Board of Directors
members represent holders of B Shares. The mandates of the current Board of Directors members will expire at
the annual General Meeting of Shareholders in April 2022, 2023 and 2024 respectively.

On 1 April 2021, Mr. Frank Esser was re-elected by the Board of Directors to the position of Chairman

of the Board of Directors for one year. Mr. Esser is currently assisted by two Vice Chairpersons, Ms. Tsega
Gebreyes and Ms. Anne-Catherine Ries, each of whom were also re-elected for one year.

In the event of a vacancy on the Board of Directors, the remaining Board of Directors members may,

upon a proposal from the Nomination Committee and on a temporary basis, fill such a vacancy by a majority
vote. In this case, the next General Meeting of Shareholders will definitively elect the new Director who will
complete the term of the Director whose seat became vacant.

In accordance with internal regulations, (amended in September 2019), the maximum tenure for any

member of the Board of Directors is fixed at 12 years. Furthermore, at least one-third of the Board of Directors
members must be independent Directors. A Board of Directors member is considered independent if he or she
has no relationship of any kind with SES or management which may impact his or her judgment. Independence
for these purposes is defined as:

- not having been an employee or officer of SES over the previous five years;

- not having had a material business relationship with SES over the last three years; and

- not representing a significant shareholder holding directly or indirectly more than 5 per cent. of SES’s
voting shares.


-----

Seven of the current Board members are considered independent: Mrs. Tsega Gebreyes, Mrs. Katrin

Wehr-Seiter, Mrs. Béatrice De Clermont-Tonnerre, Mr. Peter Van Bommel, Mr. Frank Esser, Mr. Ramu
Potarazu and Mr. Kaj-Erik Relander.

Five of the currently elected non-executive directors are female.

The following table sets forth the name, position and term of mandate of each member of the Board of

Directors as of 1 April 2021.

Betzdorf, (Grand Duchy of Luxembourg) and its telephone number is + 352 710 725-1.

**Board Practices**

According to Article 9 of the SES’s Articles of Association, SES is managed by the Board of Directors.

The General Meeting of Shareholders elects the Board of Directors and determines the number of members on
the Board of Directors, their remuneration and the term of office (which may not exceed six years). The
members of the Board of Directors shall be natural persons but need not be shareholders.

The Board of Directors is composed of a number of directors, based on a list of candidates submitted

by the Nomination Committee and representing the holders of B Shares, that is equal to one third of the total
number of members of the Board of Directors and a number of Directors, based on a list of candidates submitted
by the Nomination Committee and representing the holders of A Shares, that is equal to the difference between
the total number of Board of Directors members and the number of Board of Directors members representing


-----

the shareholders of B Shares. The shareholders may submit to the Nomination Committee a number of
candidates at least equal to the number of posts to be filled for each of their classes.

The members of the Board of Directors shall be elected among the candidates on the list presented by

the Nomination Committee and shall be appointed and may be removed at any time with or without cause by a
simple majority vote of the Shares present or represented at the General Meeting of Shareholders, without
considering abstentions.

According to Article 10 of the Articles of Association, the Board of Directors may grant special powers

and delegate the daily management of SES, as well as the representation of SES in relation to this management,
to one or several Directors, managers or other agents, shareholders or not, acting alone, jointly or in a
committee. The Board of Directors may create from time to time, one or several committees pursuant to article
441-6 of the Luxembourg Company Law composed of Board of Directors members and/or external persons and
to which it may delegate powers and roles as appropriate. On that basis, the Board of Directors shall create an
Executive Committee, a Nomination Committee, a Remuneration Committee and an Audit and Risk Committee.

According to Article 11 of the Articles of Association, the Board of Directors elects from among its

members a Chairperson. The Board of Directors shall further choose two vice-chairpersons of the Board of
Directors, one of whom shall be chosen from among the Directors nominated by the holders of A Shares, and
one from among the Directors nominated by the holders of B Shares.

Pursuant to Article 12 of the Articles of Association, the Board of Directors shall meet every time when

required by SES’s business, but generally once in a quarter. The Board of Directors shall further meet upon the
written demand of two Directors. The Board of Directors may deliberate or act validly only if a majority of the
Directors are present or represented. If such quorum is not achieved at a first meeting, the Board of Directors
may validly deliberate at a second meeting convened in accordance with the above formalities, whatever the
number of Directors present or represented.

Pursuant to Article 13 of the Articles of Association, the resolutions of the Board of Directors are

passed by a simple majority of votes of the voting Directors present or represented, without considering
abstentions. In the case of a tie, the Chairperson has no casting vote. In addition, any material contract that is
proposed to be signed by SES or any of its wholly controlled operating subsidiaries with a shareholder owning,
directly or indirectly, at least 5 per cent. of the shares of SES is subject to a prior authorisation by the Board of
Directors. It is specified that, each Director who has a direct or indirect financial interest contrary to SES’s
interest in a matter submitted to the approval of the Board of Directors, must inform the Board of Directors.
Such Director may not deliberate or vote on this matter.

SES has issued two classes of shares: A Shares and B shares.

As of 17 May 2021, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg held a direct 11.58 per cent. voting interest in

SES and two indirect interests, both of 10.88 per cent., through two state owned banks, Banque et Caisse
d’Epargne de l’Etat, Luxembourg, and Société Nationale de Crédit et d’Investissement. These shares constitute

per cent. of the net liquidation proceeds paid to shareholders of A and (ii) that the B Shares are entitled to a
preferential subscription right for all capital increases of SES. B Shares are not listed on a regulated market.
Each Share, whether of A or B, is entitled to one vote. In accordance with the Articles of Association, no
shareholder of A Shares may hold, directly or indirectly, more than 20 per cent. (twenty per cent.), 33 per cent.
(thirty-three per cent.) or 50 per cent. (fifty per cent.) of SES’s Shares unless he has obtained prior approval
from the General Meeting of Shareholders. Such limit will be calculated by taking into account the Shares of all
classes held by a shareholder of A Shares. It will not apply to the shareholders issuing fiduciary certificates in
agreement with SES.

**TAXATION**

**LUXEMBOURG TAXATION**

The following is a general description of certain tax considerations, under the existing laws of Luxembourg as
currently applied by the Luxembourg tax authorities, relating to a holding of the Securities and is included
herein solely for preliminary information purposes. It does not purport to be a complete analysis of all tax
considerations relating to the Securities. It is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or tax
advice. Prospective purchasers of the Securities should consult their tax advisers as to the consequences under
the tax laws of the country of which they are resident for tax purposes and the tax laws of any other jurisdiction
of acquiring, holding, redeeming and disposing of the Securities receiving payments and/or other amounts
thereunder. This summary is based upon the laws in force in Luxembourg on the date hereof and is subject to
any change in law that may take effect after such date.

Prospective purchasers of the Securities should be aware that the residence concept used below applies for
Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes only. Any reference in this section to a tax, duty, levy impost or
other charge or withholding of a similar nature refers to Luxembourg tax law and/or concepts only. A reference
to Luxembourg income tax generally encompasses corporate income tax (impôt sur le revenu des collectivités),
municipal business tax (impôt commercial communal), a solidarity surcharge (contribution au fonds pour
_l’emploi), as well as personal income tax (impôt sur le revenu_ _des personnes physiques)._

Corporate holders of the Securities may also be subject to net wealth tax (impôt sur la fortune) as well as other
duties, levies or taxes. Corporate income tax, municipal business tax as well as the solidarity surcharge
invariably apply to most corporate taxpayers resident in Luxembourg for tax purposes. Individual taxpayers are
generally subject to personal income tax and the solidarity surcharge. Under certain circumstances, where an
individual taxpayer acts in the course of the management of a professional or business undertaking, municipal
business tax may apply as well.

**_Luxembourg tax residency of the holders of the Securities_**

A holder of Securities will not become resident, nor be deemed to be resident, in Luxembourg by reason only of
the holding and/or disposing of the Securities or the execution, performance, delivery and/or enforcement of
his/her rights thereunder.

**_Withholding Tax_**

_Resident holders of the Securities_

Under the Luxembourg law dated 23 December 2005, as amended (the 2005 Law), a 20 per cent. Luxembourg
withholding tax is levied on interest or similar income payments made by Luxembourg paying agents to or for
the immediate benefit of an individual beneficial owner who is resident in Luxembourg. This withholding tax
also applies on accrued or capitalised interest received upon disposal, redemption or repurchase of the
Securities. Such withholding tax will be in full discharge of income tax if the beneficial owner is an individual
acting in the course of the management of his/her private wealth. Responsibility for the withholding tax is
assumed by the Luxembourg paying agent within the meaning of the 2005 Law.

Further, Luxembourg resident individuals acting in the course of their private wealth management, who are the
beneficial owners of interest payments and other similar income made by a paying agent established in a
European Union member state other than Luxembourg or the European Economic Area, may opt for a final 20
per cent. levy. In such case, the 20 per cent. levy is calculated on the basis of the same amounts as for the
payments made by Luxembourg paying agents. The option of the 20 per cent. final levy must cover all interest
payments made by such foreign paying agents to the beneficial owner over the full civil year. The Luxembourg
resident individual who is the beneficial owner of the interest is responsible for the declaration and the payment
of the 20 per cent. final levy.

_Non-resident holders of the Securities_

Under the Luxembourg tax laws currently in effect, there is no withholding tax on payments of interests
(including accrued but unpaid interest) made to a Luxembourg non-resident holder of Securities. There is also


-----

no Luxembourg withholding tax upon repayment of the principal, or upon redemption or exchange of the
Securities.

_Exchange of information_

Non-resident holders of the Securities should note that on 9 December 2014, the Council of the European Union
adopted Directive 2014/107/EU amending Directive 2011/16/EU of 15 February 2011 on administrative
cooperation in the field of taxation which now provides for an automatic exchange of financial account
information between EU Member States (the **_DAC Directive). The adoption of the aforementioned directive_**
implements the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Common Reporting
Standard (CRS) and generalizes the automatic exchange of information within the European Union as of 1
January 2016.

In addition, Luxembourg signed the OECD’s multilateral competent authority agreement (the **_Multilateral_**
**_Agreement) to automatically exchange information under the CRS. Under this Multilateral Agreement,_**
Luxembourg automatically exchanges financial account information with other participating jurisdictions as of 1
January 2016. The amended Luxembourg law dated 18 December 2015 (the **_CRS Law) implements this_**
Multilateral Agreement, together with the DAC Directive introducing the CRS, in Luxembourg.

**Income Taxation**

**_Taxation of Luxembourg non - residents_**

Holders of the Securities who are non-residents of Luxembourg and who do not have a permanent establishment
or a permanent representative in Luxembourg to which or whom the Securities are attributable are not liable to
any Luxembourg income tax, whether they receive payments of principal or interest (including accrued but
unpaid interest) or realise capital gains upon redemption, repurchase, sale or exchange, in any form whatsoever,
of any Securities.

Holders of the Securities who are non-residents of Luxembourg and who have a permanent establishment or a
permanent representative in Luxembourg to which or whom the Securities are attributable are liable to
Luxembourg income tax on any interest received or accrued, as well as any capital gain realised on the sale or
disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Securities and have to include this income in their taxable income for
Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes.

**_Taxation of Luxembourg residents_**

_Luxembourg resident individuals_

An individual holder of Securities acting in the course of the management of his/her private wealth, is subject to
Luxembourg income tax in respect of interest received, redemption premiums or issue discounts under the
Securities except if a final withholding tax has been levied on such payments in accordance with the 2005 Law.

Under Luxembourg domestic tax law, gains realised upon the sale, disposal or redemption, in any form
whatsoever, of the Securities by an individual holders of Securities who is a resident of Luxembourg for tax
purposes and who acts in the course of the management of his/her private wealth, are not subject to Luxembourg
income tax, provided this sale or disposal takes place more than six months after the acquisition of the
Securities.

An individual holder of Securities who acts in the course of the management of his/her private wealth and who
is a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes, has to include the portion of the gain corresponding to accrued but
unpaid income in respect of the Securities in his/her taxable income, insofar as the accrued but unpaid interest is
indicated separately in the agreement, except if a final withholding tax or levy has been levied in accordance
with the 2005 Law.

Luxembourg resident individual holders of the Securities acting in the course of the management of a
professional or business undertaking to which the Securities are attributable, have to include any interest
received or accrued, as well as any gain realised on the sale or disposal of the Securities, in any form
whatsoever, in their taxable income for Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes. Taxable gains are
determined as being the difference between the sale, repurchase or redemption price (including accrued but


-----

unpaid interest) and the lower of the cost or book value of the Securities sold or redeemed. If applicable, the 20
per cent. Luxembourg withholding tax levied in accordance with the 2005 Law will be credited against their
final income tax liability.

_Luxembourg corporate residents_

Luxembourg corporate holders of the Securities must include any interest received or accrued, as well as any
gain realised on the sale or disposal in any form whatsoever of the Securities in their taxable income for
Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes. Taxable gains are determined as being the difference between the
sale, repurchase or redemption price (including acquired but unpaid interest) and the lower of the cost or book
value of the Securities sold or redeemed.

_Luxembourg residents benefiting from a special tax regime_

Luxembourg holders of the Securities who benefit from a special tax regime, such as, (i) undertakings for
collective investment subject to the amended law of 17 December 2010, (ii) specialised investment funds
subject to the amended law of 13 February 2007, (iii) reserved alternative investment funds (under certain
conditions) governed by the amended law of 23 July 2016, or (iv) family wealth management companies
governed by the amended law of 11 May 2007, are exempt from income taxes in Luxembourg and thus income
derived from the Securities as well as gains realised thereon, are not subject to income taxes.

**_Net Wealth Tax_**

Luxembourg resident holders of the Securities, and Luxembourg non-resident holders of the Securities who
have a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in Luxembourg to which or whom the Securities
are attributable, are subject to Luxembourg net wealth tax on such Securities, except if the holder of Securities is
(i) a resident or non-resident individual taxpayer, (ii) an undertaking for collective investment subject to the
amended law of 17 December 2010, (iii) a securitisation company governed by the amended law of 22 March
2004 on securitisation, (iv) a company governed by the amended law of 15 June 2004 on venture capital
vehicles or (v) a specialised investment fund governed by the amended law of 13 February 2007, (vi) a reserved
alternative investment fund vehicle governed by the amended law of 23 July 2016, (vii) a family wealth
management company governed by the amended law of 11 May 2007 or (viii) a professional pension institution

**_Other Taxes_**

There is no Luxembourg registration tax, stamp duty or any other similar tax or duty payable in Luxembourg by
the holders of the Securities as a consequence of the issuance of the Securities nor will any of these taxes be
payable as a consequence of a subsequent transfer of redemption or repurchase of the Securities (except in cases
of voluntary registration in Luxembourg or attachment to a document that requires mandatory registration in
Luxembourg).

Under Luxembourg tax law, where an individual holder of the Securities is a resident of Luxembourg for
inheritance tax purposes at the time of his/her death, the Securities are included in his/her taxable base for
inheritance tax purposes. On the contrary, no estate or inheritance taxes are levied on the transfer of the
Securities upon death of an individual holder of Securities in cases where the deceased was not a resident of
Luxembourg for inheritance tax purposes at the time of his/her death.

Luxembourg gift tax may be due on a gift or donation of Securities if the gift is recorded in a deed passed in
front of a Luxembourg notary or otherwise registered in Luxembourg.

There is no Luxembourg value added tax payable in respect of payments in consideration for the issuance of the
Securities or in respect of the payment of interest or principal under the Securities or the transfer of the
Securities.


-----

**UNITED STATES TAXATION**

The following is a summary based on present law of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations for
prospective purchasers of the Securities. It addresses only Non-U.S. Holders (as defined below) that purchase
Securities in the offering. This discussion addresses only certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relating
to circumstances where SES Global Americas Holdings GP makes guarantee payments under the Guarantee to
Non-U.S. Holders and does not address any other tax considerations that may be relevant to a Non U.S. Holder
relating to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Securities by a Non U.S. Holder. The discussion is
not a substitute for tax advice. It does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to a Non U.S.
Holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including tax consequences that may be applicable to
persons subject to special rules, such as banks, certain other financial institutions, securities dealers, insurance
companies, certain U.S. expatriates or persons holding the Securities as part of or in connection with a fixed
base or permanent establishment outside the United States.

In this discussion, a Non-U.S. Holder is a beneficial owner of a Security that is not for U.S. federal income tax
purposes (i) a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a partnership or other entity or arrangement treated as
a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (iii) a corporation or other entity treated as a corporation
organised in or under the laws of the United States or its political subdivisions, (iv) a trust subject to the control
of a United States person and the primary supervision of a U.S. court or (v) an estate the income of which is
subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source.

**_Withholding Tax on Guarantee Payments under the Guarantee_**

Guarantee payments made by SES Global Americas Holdings GP to a Non-U.S. Holder under the Guarantee on
a Security issued by SES are generally expected to constitute income from sources without the United States and
therefore should not be subject to U.S. withholding tax. However, no rulings have been, or will be, sought from
the Internal Revenue Service (the **_IRS) regarding the source of payments made by SES Global Americas_**
Holdings GP under the Guarantee and no assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court
would not uphold, the position that payments under the Guarantee are from a U.S. source. In general, if
payments by SES Global Americas Holdings GP under the Guarantee were treated as being from a U.S. source,
U.S. withholding tax would apply to such payments at a rate of 30 per cent. unless reduced by an applicable
income tax treaty or a specific U.S. withholding tax exemption. Prospective purchasers are urged to consult their
tax advisors about the proper source of payments received under the Guarantee from SES Global Americas
Holdings and the consequences to them if payments under the Guarantee are treated as being from a U.S.
source.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

Guarantee payments made by SES Global Americas Holdings GP in respect of interest and principal due on the
Securities that are made to an account within the United States or by a U.S. paying agent or other U.S.
intermediaries to a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to backup withholding and certain information reporting
requirements if appropriate certification (IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E or other appropriate form) is
provided by the Non-U.S. Holder to the payor and the payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know
that the certificate is false. Any backup withholding tax may be credited against a holder’s U.S. federal income
tax liability or refunded to the extent it exceeds the holder’s liability.

**THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY OF CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME**
**TAX CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN THE SECURITIES. IT DOES NOT**
**COVER ALL TAX MATTERS THAT MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR INVESTOR.**
**EACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR IS URGED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR ABOUT**
**THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO IT OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE SECURITIES IN LIGHT OF**
**THE INVESTOR’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to the Conditions, all payments of principal, premium and interest by
or on behalf of the Guarantor under the Guarantee shall be made free and clear of, and without withholding or
deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of
whatever nature imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by or within the United States or any political
subdivision or any authority thereof or therein having power to tax, unless such withholding or deduction is
required by law. In that event, the Guarantor would, pursuant to Condition 15, be obliged to pay such additional
amounts as would result in receipt by the Holders of such amounts as would have been received by them had no


-----

such withholding or deduction been required, although this is subject to certain exceptions set out in the
Conditions.

**THE PROPOSED FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS TAX (FTT)**

On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the **_Commission’s Proposal) for a_**
Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia
and Slovakia (the participating Member States); in December 2015 Estonia withdrew from the group of states
willing to introduce the FTT.

The Commission’s Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in
Securities (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. The issuance and subscription of
Securities should, however, be exempt.

Under the Commission’s Proposal, the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and
outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Securities where
at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State.
A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a participating Member State in a broad
range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or
(b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating Member State.

However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member States, and the
scope of any such tax remains uncertain. Additional European Union Member States may decide to participate.

Prospective holders of the Securities are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

**GLOSSARY**

**_Analogue_**

Transmission method for conveying voice, data, images or video information using a continuous signal.

**_Bandwidth_**

Part of the electromagnetic frequency spectrum used for radio frequency transmission.

**_Beam_**

Term used to describe the radiation pattern of a satellite antenna. The intersection of a satellite beam with the
surface of the Earth is called the footprint (of the beam).

**_C-band_**

Frequency range assigned to satellite communications systems, approximately 4 GHz for the downlink and
6 GHz for the uplink. The associated transmission power is relatively low in comparison with Ku-band, for
example. Larger antennae are therefore required for C-band operation. Considered to be the frequency range
least susceptible to transmission impairments such as rain.

**_Capacity_**

Quantity of information transmitted. By analogy, there is often reference to spectrum width and to the associated
power needed to transmit this quantity of information.

**_Contract backlog_**

The minimum future revenue due to the Group under its existing customer contracts. In relation to contracts
where customers have discretionary termination rights, the minimum future revenue represents the revenue up to
the earliest termination point as well as the applicable termination fee (if any).

**_Digital_**

Format for recording, processing, transmitting and broadcasting data via a digital binary code signal (and not by
the modulation of a continuous signal as in analogue transmission).

**_Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)_**

A technology enabling the use of the copper lines connecting customers of a switched telephone network for
purposes of digital broadband connectivity.

**_Direct-to-Cable (DTC)_**

A method of transmission that transmits satellite programmes directly to cable networks.

**_Direct-to-home (DTH)_**

A method of transmission that transmits satellite programmes directly to customers’ homes.


-----

**_Downlink_**

Transmission path for data or other signals from a communications satellite to an earth station.

**_Earth station_**

Installation required in order to receive a signal from a satellite and/or transmit a signal to a satellite. The facility
consists of an antenna and communications equipment on the ground and is also known as a ground station.

**_Fixed Satellite Service (FSS)_**

Geostationary communications satellites between earth stations located at fixed points used for broadcast feeds
for television stations, radio stations and broadcast networks, as well as for telephony, telecommunications and
data communications.

**_Frequency_**

Number of vibrations produced by unit of time during a given period. Frequency relates to the rate of variation
per second of the carrier wave or modulating signal. Satellite transmissions are generally in GHz (see “C-band,”
“Ka-band” and “Ku-band”).

**_Geostationary orbit (GEO)_**

The orbit whose altitude above the equator is 36,000 km, where a satellite travels at the same angular speed as
the rotating earth. Objects situated in this orbit appear motionless from a ground observer.

**_High definition television (HDTV)_**

Television that offers a clearer and more detailed picture and requires two or three times more bandwidth than
standard definition channels.

**_HD+_**

Proprietary access system developed by SES to enable the reception of encrypted Free-To-Air High Definition
TV signals.

**_High Throughput Satellite (HTS)_**

A satellite whose payload is configured to re-use frequency spectrum available at a given orbital position, with
the objective of increasing the maximum bandwidth available and delivering it at lower unit cost.

**_Hosted payloads_**

Payloads carried on a satellite for third parties, which are additional to the primary mission of the satellite.

**_IPTV_**

Internet Protocol Television. Television signals delivered via IP technology.


-----

**_Ka-band_**

A frequency range assigned to satellite communications systems, approximately 20 GHz for the downlink and
30 GHz for the uplink. These frequencies have the shortest wavelength of the three principal frequency bands
used by geostationary satellites. Small antennae can be used, but Ka-band requires the use of high-power beams
that are tightly concentrated over fairly small geographical areas. The Ka-band is optimized for applications
such as broadband services. Considered to be less reliable due to risk of weather-related transmission
impairments.

**_Ka-band (GovSat-1)_**

A part of the Ka-band spectrum reserved by the ITU for governmental use.

**_Ku-band_**

A frequency range assigned to satellite communications systems, approximately 14 GHz for the uplink and 11
GHz for the downlink. Used for radio and television, this band is the most widespread in Europe as a result of
the small size of the antennae needed for reception. Generally highly reliable and seldom affected by weatherrelated impairments.

**_L-band_**

The frequency range between 1 and 2 GHz. Mainly used for maritime mobile satellite services.

**_Low Earth Orbit (LEO)_**

Describing the orbit below about 2,000 km altitude.

**_Medium Earth Orbit (MEO)_**

Describing the orbit between LEO (~2,000 km) and GEO (~36,000km).

**_MNO_**

Mobile Network Operator.

**_Mobile backhaul_**

The transmission of mobile cellular traffic using satellite to connect cells which do not have terrestrial linkage.

**_Payload_**

Set of satellite equipment used for reception, frequency conversion, processing and retransmission of the
communications signals after they have been amplified, but excluding add-on equipment such as the platform
(physical structure and subsystems such as electrical, thermal and altitude control etc.).

**_Radio frequency_**

Electromagnetic frequency generally higher than 20 kHz, used to transmit information.


-----

**_Redundancy_**

Integral satellite design feature involving the use of several identical components, each able to replace any of the
others in the event of failure.

**_Steerable beam_**

Beam of a satellite antenna that can be directed onto a particular geographical region using ground-based
controls.

**_Telemetry, tracking and control (TT&C)_**

System that provides an important communication link between the satellite and the earth station. It enables an
uplink for command and a downlink for monitoring the health of satellite components, as well as providing
tracking information for monitoring the satellite’s position in orbit.

**_Transponder_**

Name given to the retransmitter on board a satellite whose function is to retransmit the signals received from the
earth uplink station into the designated geographic coverage area of the satellite.

**_Ultra-High Definition Television (UHDTV)_**

A further enhancement of video display quality, delivering about four times the resolution of HD and requiring
correspondingly greater amounts of bandwidth to transmit. UHDTV significantly enhances the colour range,
contrast and audio quality of the broadcast beyond that delivered by HD TV.

**_Uplink_**

Transmission of data or other signals from an earth station to a communications satellite.

**_Very small aperture terminal (VSAT)_**

A station, located on Earth, used in satellite communications of data, voice and video signals. Typically part of a
network, the antenna size can range from 80 cm to 2 m.

**_X-band_**

Frequency range from approximately 8 – 12 GHz, reserved for governmental use.
