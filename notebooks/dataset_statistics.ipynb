      "Subsection Text: _We have taken on significant debt, which may adversely affect our business._ We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of March 31, 2021, after giving effect to the offering of the Notes offered hereby, the issuance and sale of the Existing Secured Notes, in each case the use of proceeds therefrom, and the creation of the New Revolving Credit Facility, our total consolidated indebtedness would have been approximately $5.4 billion, all of which we will need to refinance or repay. We would also have had $0.7 billion of secured borrowings drawn under our revolving credit facilities. There can be no assurances we will be able to refinance our indebtedness in the future (1) on commercially reasonable terms, (2) on terms, including with respect to interest rates, as favorable as our current debt or (3) at all. Our debt burden could have important consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund our operations, growth strategy, working capital, capital expenditures, future business opportunities and other general corporate purposes; exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates with respect to any borrowings that are at variable rates of interest; restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions; and placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors who are less highly leveraged. In addition, a significant portion of our cash and investments are held outside the United States, and we may not be able to service our debt without undergoing the costs of repatriating those funds. _The instruments that govern, or will govern, our debt contain, or will contain, various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business._ Instruments that govern, or will govern, our indebtedness, including the Existing Credit Agreement, the indenture governing the Existing Unsecured Notes (the “Unsecured Notes Indenture”), the indenture governing the Existing Secured Notes (the “Secured Notes Indenture”) and the Indenture, impose or will impose operating and financial restrictions on our activities. These restrictions limit or prohibit our ability and the ability of us and our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: - incur indebtedness or grant liens on our property to secure indebtedness; - dispose of assets or equity; - make acquisitions or investments; - make dividends, distributions or other restricted payments; - effect affiliate transactions; - enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and - enter into mergers, consolidations or sales of substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries. In addition, the Existing Credit Agreement includes a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a total net leverage ratio (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) equal to or less than certain levels set forth in the Existing Credit Agreement. These restrictions on our ability to operate our business could seriously harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities. Further, various risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our financing agreements could result in an event of default under those agreements and under any other agreements containing cross-default provisions. Such an event of default, if not waived or cured, would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to 19 ----- foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt (including the Collateral securing the Notes offered hereby, the Existing Secured Notes and the Existing Credit Facilities). Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations, including our obligations under the Existing Credit Agreement. the Unsecured Notes Indenture, the Secured Notes Indenture and the Indenture. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all. _If we default on our obligations under our other indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on the Notes._ Any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under the Indenture, the Existing Credit Agreement, the Unsecured Notes Indenture or the Secured Notes Indenture that is not waived by the required percentage of noteholders or lenders, as applicable, could impede our ability to pay principal and premium amounts, if any, and interest on the Notes and substantially decrease the market value of the Notes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the agreements governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such a default, the holders of such indebtedness in the applicable required percentage could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, lenders under our revolving credit facilities in the applicable required percentage could elect to terminate their commitments and lenders under the Existing Credit Facilities and the holders of the Notes offered hereby and the Existing Notes in the applicable required percentage could institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets that constitute the Collateral, and we may seek protection under the bankruptcy code. If we breach our covenants under the Indenture, the Existing Credit Agreement, the Unsecured Notes Indenture, the Secured Notes Indenture or under any agreements governing future senior credit facilities or other indebtedness, we may need to request waivers from the required percentage of lenders or required percentage of noteholders to avoid being in default. If we are unable to obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, we would be in default under the instrument governing that indebtedness, the lenders or noteholders could exercise their rights as described above, and we may seek protection under the bankruptcy code. _Our ability to service and repay the Notes will be dependent on the cash flow generated by our subsidiaries and events beyond our control._ The Issuer’s only material asset is its interest in its subsidiaries. The Issuer conducts its operations through, and most of its assets are owned by, its subsidiaries, and its operating income and cash flow are generated by its subsidiaries. As a result, repayment of the Notes will depend on our subsidiaries’ generation of cash flow, which will, in turn, depend principally upon future operating performance, and our subsidiaries’ ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. If our operating subsidiaries experience sufficiently adverse changes in its financial position or results of operations, or we otherwise become unable to pay our debts as they become due and obtain further credit, this could result in the commencement of insolvency proceedings. Any such proceedings would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, will affect our ability to make payments on our debt. In particular, due to the seasonal nature of the beauty industry, with the highest levels of consumer demand generally occurring during the holiday buying season in our second fiscal quarter, our subsidiaries’ cash flow in the second half of the fiscal year may be less than in the first half of the fiscal year, which may affect our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations, including to service the Notes offered hereby. In addition, we earn a significant amount of our operating income, and hold a significant portion of our cash and investments, in our foreign subsidiaries outside the United States. As of March 31, 2021, the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the United States by our foreign subsidiaries was $258.3 million. If our U.S. subsidiaries are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, including to service the Notes offered hereby, we may need to repatriate additional earnings and we may be subject to a higher effective tax rate. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, including payments on the Notes, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. Our ability to restructure or refinance 20 ----- our debt will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could result in higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of the Indenture, the Existing Credit Agreement, the Unsecured Notes Indenture, the Secured Notes Indenture or any existing debt instruments or future debt instruments that we may enter into may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. The inability of our subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, including the inability to service the Notes offered hereby, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows or liquidity financial and may impact our ability to satisfy our obligations in respect of the Notes. _We may incur substantially more debt, including secured debt, or take other actions that may affect our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Notes._ Although the terms of the Indenture will restrict, and the terms of the Existing Credit Agreement, the Unsecured Notes Indenture and Secured Notes Indenture restrict, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens securing indebtedness, such restrictions are subject to several exceptions and qualifications. Accordingly, we will be able to incur additional indebtedness, including secured debt, as permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Existing Credit Agreement, the Unsecured Notes Indenture and the Secured Notes Indenture. Such additional indebtedness may be substantial. Our ability to recapitalize, incur additional debt and take a number of other actions that are not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture, the Existing Credit Agreement, the Unsecured Notes Indenture and the Secured Notes Indenture could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the Notes when due, and may also require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our other indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of cash flow to fund our operations, working capital and capital expenditures. In addition, if we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks pari passu in right of payment to the Notes, the holders of that debt will be able to share ratably with the holders of such series of the Notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of us. If our subsidiaries that are not guaranteeing the Notes incur any indebtedness, all of such debt will be structurally senior to the Notes, and the holders of that debt will benefit prior to the holders of the Notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of any such entity. _Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase._ Borrowings under our Existing Credit Facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. As of March 31, 2021, after giving effect to the offering of the Notes offered hereby, the issuance and sale of the Existing Secured Notes, in each case the use of proceeds therefrom and the creation of the New Revolving Credit Facility, $1.0 billion, or approximately 18% of our total debt, would have been at variable rates of interest. We would also have had $2.1 billion of secured borrowings available under our revolving credit facilities. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness referred to above would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. For every 10% increase or decrease in our interest rates, our (Loss) income before income taxes for the twelve month period ended March 31, 2021 would have changed by approximately $3.4 million, assuming that all other variables stayed the same. We are currently party to, and in the future, we may enter into additional, interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments, in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. _Our credit ratings may not reflect the risks of investing in the Notes._ Our credit ratings are an assessment by rating agencies of our ability to pay our debts when due and include many subjective factors. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the value of the Notes. Also, these credit ratings may not reflect the potential impact of risks relating to structure or marketing of the Notes. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating. There can be no assurance that our credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency, if, in that rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant. There can also be no assurance that our credit ratings will reflect all of the factors that would be important to holders of the Notes. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any 21 ----- announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could affect the value of the Notes, may increase our borrowing costs and may negatively impact our ability to incur additional debt. The reports of the rating agencies do not form a part of, and are not incorporated by reference into, this offering memorandum. _Redemption may adversely affect your return on the Notes._ The Notes are redeemable at our option, and therefore we may choose to redeem the Notes at times when prevailing interest rates are relatively low. As a result, you may not be able to reinvest the proceeds you receive from the redemption in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on your Notes being redeemed. _We may not be able to purchase the Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event, which would result in a default under the Indenture and would adversely affect our business and financial condition._ Upon the occurrence of a “Change of Control Triggering Event” within the meaning of the Indenture with respect to the Notes, we will be required to repurchase all or any part of such holder’s Notes of such series at 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the purchase date. We may not have sufficient funds available to make any required repurchases of the Notes, and we may be unable to receive distributions or advances from our subsidiaries in the future sufficient to meet such repurchase obligation. In addition, a change of control triggering event may also accelerate obligations to repurchase amounts outstanding under our and our subsidiaries’ indebtedness and require us (or our subsidiaries), among other things, to make similar offerings in respect of our and their outstanding indebtedness. In addition, restrictions under future debt instruments may not permit us to repurchase the Notes. If we fail to repurchase the Notes in that circumstance, we will be in default under the Indenture. If, due to a default, the repayment of related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay such indebtedness or the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Repurchase of Notes Upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.” _Some significant restructuring transactions may not constitute a change of control triggering event, in which case we would not be obligated to offer to purchase the affected Notes._ Upon the occurrence of a “Change of Control Triggering Event” within the meaning of the Indenture with respect to the Notes, holders of the Notes have the right to require us to purchase their Notes. However, the “Change of Control Triggering Event” provisions will not afford protection to holders of Notes in the event of certain transactions. For example, transactions such as leveraged recapitalizations, refinancings, restructurings or acquisitions initiated by us may not constitute a “Change of Control Triggering Event” requiring us to purchase the Notes. Further, various transactions might not constitute a “Change of Control Triggering Event” under the Notes but could constitute a change of control triggering event as defined under our other debt. In the event of any such transaction, the holders would not have the right to require us to purchase the Notes, even though such transaction could increase the amount of our indebtedness, or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure or any credit ratings, thereby adversely affecting the holders of Notes. _The ability of holders of the Notes to require us to repurchase the Notes as a result of a disposition of “substantially all” assets may be uncertain._ The definition of “Change of Control Triggering Event” in the Indenture will include a phrase relating to sale, lease, transfer or other conveyance, in one or a series of related transactions, of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of the Notes to require us to repurchase such Notes as a result of a sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries taken as a whole to another person or group may be uncertain. _Many of the covenants in the Indenture will not apply to us if the Notes have investment grade ratings from at least two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch and no default has occurred and is continuing._ Many of the covenants in the Indenture will not apply to us if the Notes have investment grade ratings from at least two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch and no default has occurred and is continuing. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever be rated investment grade, or that if they are rated investment grade, that the Notes will maintain 22 ----- these ratings. However, suspension of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in effect. To the extent the covenants are subsequently reinstated, any such actions taken while the covenants were suspended would not result in an event of default under the Indenture. See “Description of Notes—Covenant Suspension.” _A trading market for the Notes may not develop._ The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. In addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” We intend to apply for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of TISE. However, we cannot guarantee that the application to list the Notes on the Official List of TISE will be approved as of the issue date or any date thereafter, that the permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that the listing of the Notes will be maintained, and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing. TISE is not a regulated market for the purposes of MiFID II. The initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. They are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes and any market-making may be discontinued at any time at their sole discretion. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the development or liquidity of any market for the Notes. If a market develops, the Notes could trade at prices that may be lower than the initial offering price of the Notes. Further, if an active market does not develop or is not maintained, the price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. Historically, debt markets have been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The market, if any, for the Notes may not be free from similar disruptions, and any such disruptions may adversely affect the prices at which holders of the Notes may sell their Notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the Notes may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our performance and other factors. _Not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes, and your right to receive payment on the Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries._ Not all of our subsidiaries will be required to guarantee the Notes. The Notes will be guaranteed by the Issuer and the Guarantors, which do not include foreign subsidiaries and certain U.S. subsidiaries excepted from providing guarantees under the terms of the Existing Credit Agreement. Creditors of our non-guarantor subsidiaries will generally be entitled to payment from the assets of those subsidiaries before those assets can be distributed for the benefit of noteholders. As a result, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to the prior payment of all of the existing and future debt and other liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to the Issuer or the Guarantors of the Notes. Our guarantor subsidiaries, under our Existing Credit Agreement, include our United States subsidiaries other than Younique, LLC (sold in August 2019) and King Kylie, LLC (acquired in January 2020). For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 and nine months ended March 31, 2021, the U.S. Subsidiaries had net revenues to third parties from continuing operations of $1,234 million and $1,069 million, respectively. In addition, as of June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2021, the U.S. Subsidiaries had Long-lived Assets of $3,118 million and $2,979 million, respectively. Long-lived Assets include property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets. Unless they are Guarantors, our subsidiaries will not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions or debt repayments to enable us to make payments in respect of the Notes. Each such subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and may be subject to legal or contractual restrictions that, under certain circumstances, may limit our ability to obtain cash from them. In the event that we do not receive sufficient cash from our subsidiaries, we will be unable to make required principal, premium, if any, and interest payments on the Notes. _There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the Notes. In addition, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to registration rights, and we do not currently intend to register the Notes under applicable securities laws._ The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to exemptions from registration under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the Notes in the United States only in a transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time. You may 23 ----- not offer or sell the Notes except under an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and we do not intend to register the Notes for resale or to offer to exchange the Notes for registered notes under the Securities Act. By purchasing the Notes, you will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgements, representations and agreements as set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.” _Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to avoid the Notes and the guarantees, to require holders of the Notes to return payments received from us or the Guarantors, and to take other actions detrimental to the holders of the Notes._ Federal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes may apply to the issuance of the Notes, the delivery of any guarantees of the Notes, including the guarantees by the Guarantors entered into upon issuance of the Notes, and any subsidiary guarantees that may be entered into thereafter under the terms of the Indenture. Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the issuance of the Notes and the delivery of guarantees could be avoided (that is, canceled) as fraudulent transfers or conveyances if a court determined that we, at the time we issued the Notes, or any of the Guarantors, at the time it delivered the applicable guarantee (or, in some jurisdictions, at the time payment became due under the Notes or a guarantee), (I) issued the Notes or provided the applicable guarantee, as the case may be, with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding any present or future creditor; or (II) (A) received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for issuing the Notes or providing such guarantee, as the case may be, and (B) (1) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such issuance or provision, (2) was engaged in a business or transaction for which the Issuer’s or such Guarantor’s remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital, or (3) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they matured. A court would likely find that the Issuer or a Guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the Notes or the applicable guarantee if the Issuer or such Guarantor did not benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes or such guarantee. As a general matter, subject to the standards noted above, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or an antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. If the Notes or guarantees are avoided or limited under fraudulent transfer or other laws, any claim you may make against the Issuer or the Guarantors for amounts payable on the Notes or guarantees, as the case may be, will be unenforceable to the extent of such avoidance or limitation. We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether the Issuer or a Guarantor was solvent at the relevant time that, if applicable in a particular jurisdiction, may be when payment became due under the Notes or a guarantee. Regardless of the actual standard applied by the court, we cannot be certain that the issuance of the Notes or a guarantee would not be avoided. The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, the Issuer or a Guarantor would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the value of its property, at a fair valuation; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. To the extent that a court avoids or otherwise finds the Notes or a guarantee unenforceable for any other reason, your claims against the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor would be eliminated or limited. In addition, the court might 24 ----- direct you to repay any amounts already received from the Issuer or such Guarantor. Further, the avoidance of the Notes or a related guarantee could result in an event of default with respect to our other debt that, in turn, could result in acceleration of such debt. In certain circumstances, a court may subordinate claims in respect of the Notes or a guarantee to all other debts of an Issuer or a Guarantor, or take other actions detrimental to the noteholders, based on equitable or other grounds. We cannot be certain as to the standards that a court might apply and whether it might find such subordination or other actions appropriate. If a guarantee were legally challenged, such guarantee could also be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the Guarantor, the obligations of the Guarantor were incurred for less than fair consideration. A court could thus avoid the obligations under the guarantee. Although each guarantee will contain a provision intended to limit that Guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer, that provision may not be effective to protect those guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce that Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless. Even if the guarantees of the Notes remain in force, the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantee may not be sufficient to pay the Notes in full when due. _Because each Guarantor’s liability under its guarantees may be reduced to zero, avoided or released under certain circumstances, you may not receive any payments from some or all of the Guarantors._ You have the benefit of the guarantees of the Guarantors. However, the guarantees by the Guarantors are limited to the maximum amount that the Guarantors are permitted to guarantee under applicable law. As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be reduced to zero, depending on the amount of other obligations of such Guarantor. Further, under the circumstances discussed more fully above, a court under Federal or state fraudulent conveyance and transfer statutes could void the obligations under a guarantee or further subordinate it to all other obligations of the Guarantor. In addition, you will lose the benefit of a particular guarantee if it is released under certain circumstances described under “Description of Notes—Guarantees.” _Holders of the Notes may be subject to the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as possible exchange controls, relating to the U.S. dollar and the euro._ The initial investors in the Notes will be required to pay for the Notes in euro. Neither we nor the initial purchasers will be obligated to assist the initial investors in obtaining euro or in converting other currencies into euro to facilitate the payment of the purchase price for the Notes. An investment in any security denominated in, and all payments with respect to which are to be made in, a currency other than the currency of the country in which an investor in the Notes resides or the currency in which an investor conducts its business or activities (the “investor’s home currency”), entails significant risks not associated with a similar investment in a security denominated in the investor’s home currency. In the case of the Notes offered hereby, these risks may include the possibility of: - significant changes in rates of exchange between the euro and the investor’s home currency; and - the imposition or modification of foreign exchange controls with respect to the euro or the investor’s home currency. We have no control over a number of factors affecting the Notes offered hereby and foreign exchange rates, including economic, financial and political events that are important in determining the existence, magnitude and longevity of these risks and their effects. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates between two currencies result from the interaction over time of many factors directly or indirectly affecting economic and political conditions in the countries issuing such currencies, and economic and political developments globally and in other relevant countries. Foreign currency exchange rates may be affected by, among other factors, existing and expected rates of inflation, existing and expected interest rate levels, the balance of payments between countries, and the extent of the governmental surpluses or deficits in various countries. All of these factors are, in turn, sensitive to the monetary, fiscal and trade policies pursued by the governments of various countries important to international trade and finance. Moreover, the recent global economic volatility and the actions taken or to be taken by various national governments 25 ----- in response to the volatility could significantly affect the exchange rates between the euro and the investor’s home currency. The exchange rate of an investor’s home currency for euro and the fluctuations in the exchange rate that have occurred in the past are not necessarily indicative of the exchange rates or the fluctuations therein that may occur in the future. Depreciation of the euro against the investor’s home currency would result in a decrease in the investor’s home currency equivalent yield on a Note, in the investor’s home currency equivalent of the principal payable at the maturity of that Note and generally in the investor’s home currency equivalent market value of that Note. Appreciation of the euro in relation to the investor’s home currency would have the opposite effects. The European Union or one or more of its member states may, in the future, impose exchange controls and modify any exchange controls imposed, which controls could affect exchange rates, as well as the availability of the euro at the time of payment of principal of, interest on, or any redemption or additional amounts with respect to, the Notes. This description of foreign exchange risks does not describe all the risks of an investment in securities, including, in particular, the Notes, that are denominated or payable in a currency other than an investor’s home currency. You should consult your own financial and legal advisors as to the risks involved in an investment in the Notes. _Trading in the clearing system is subject to minimum denomination requirements._ The Notes will be issued with a minimum denomination of €100,000 and multiple of €1,000 in excess of €100,000. It is possible that the clearing systems may process trades that could result in amounts being held in denominations smaller than the minimum denominations. If definitive Notes are required to be issued in relation to such Notes in accordance with the provisions of the relevant global notes, a holder who does not have the minimum denomination or a multiple of €1,000 in excess of €100,000, as applicable, in its account with the relevant clearing stem at the relevant time may not receive all of its entitlement in the form of definitive Notes unless and until such time as its holding satisfies the minimum denomination requirement. _In a lawsuit for payment on the Notes, an investor may bear currency exchange risk._ The Notes will be governed by New York law. Under New York law, a New York state court rendering a judgment on the Notes would be required to render the judgment in euro. However, the judgment would be converted into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of entry of the judgment. Consequently, in a lawsuit for payment on the Notes, investors would bear currency exchange risk until a New York state court judgment is entered, which could be a long time from the date the judgment is rendered. In courts outside of New York, investors may not be able to obtain a judgment in a currency other than U.S. dollars. For example, a judgment for money in an action based on the Notes in many other U.S. federal or state courts ordinarily would be enforced in the United States only in U.S. dollars. The date used to determine the rate of conversion of euro into U.S. dollars will depend upon various factors, including which court renders the judgment. _The Notes permit us to make payments in U.S. dollars if we are unable to obtain euro._ We will pay the principal of and interest on each Note to the registered holder in euro in immediately available funds, provided that, if on or after the issuance of the Notes, the euro is unavailable to us due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or if the euro is no longer being used by the then-member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, then all payments in respect of the Notes will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to us or so used. In such circumstances, the amount payable on any date in euro will be converted into U.S. dollars at the rate mandated by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board as the close of business on the second business day prior to the relevant payment date or, in the event of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board has not mandated a rate of conversion, on the basis of the then-most recent U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate available on or prior to the second business day prior to the relevant payment date as determined by us in our sole discretion. Any payment in respect of the Notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default under the Notes or the Indenture. See “Description of Notes—Terms of the Notes.” This exchange rate may be materially less favorable than the rate in effect at the time the Notes were issued or as would be determined by applicable law. Such developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could materially adversely affect the value of the Notes and you may lose a significant amount of your investment in the Notes. 26 ----- _Certain considerations relating to book-entry interests._ The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and Clearstream. Interests in the Global Notes (as such term is defined in “Book-Entry, Settlement and Clearance”) will trade in bookentry form only. Unless and until the Notes in definitive registered form are issued in exchange for book-entry interests, owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of the Notes. The common depositary (or its nominee) for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream will be the registered holder of the Global Notes. Payments in respect of the Global Notes representing the Notes (including principal, premium, interest and additional amounts, if any) will be made to the paying agent. The paying agent will then make such payments to the common depositary (or its nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream. The common depositary (or its nominee) will in turn distribute such payments to participants in accordance with its procedures. After payment to the common depositary (or its nominee), we, the Trustee and the paying agent will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and if you are not a participant in Euroclear or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of notes under the Indenture. See “Book-Entry, Settlement and Clearance.” Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream or, if applicable, a participant. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any request actions on a timely basis. Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until notes in definitive registered form are issued in respect of all book entry interests, if you own a book entry interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear or Clearstream. We, the Trustee and the paying agent cannot assure you that the procedures to be implemented through Euroclear or Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes. See “Book-Entry, Settlement and Clearance.”\n",
      "Prompt: Please analyze the following subsection:\n",
      "Title: nan\n",
      "Text: _We have taken on significant debt, which may adversely affect our business._ We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of March 31, 2021, after giving effect to the offering of the Notes offered hereby, the issuance and sale of the Existing Secured Notes, in each case the use of proceeds therefrom, and the creation of the New Revolving Credit Facility, our total consolidated indebtedness would have been approximately $5.4 billion, all of which we will need to refinance or repay. We would also have had $0.7 billion of secured borrowings drawn under our revolving credit facilities. There can be no assurances we will be able to refinance our indebtedness in the future (1) on commercially reasonable terms, (2) on terms, including with respect to interest rates, as favorable as our current debt or (3) at all. Our debt burden could have important consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund our operations, growth strategy, working capital, capital expenditures, future business opportunities and other general corporate purposes; exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates with respect to any borrowings that are at variable rates of interest; restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions; and placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors who are less highly leveraged. In addition, a significant portion of our cash and investments are held outside the United States, and we may not be able to service our debt without undergoing the costs of repatriating those funds. _The instruments that govern, or will govern, our debt contain, or will contain, various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business._ Instruments that govern, or will govern, our indebtedness, including the Existing Credit Agreement, the indenture governing the Existing Unsecured Notes (the “Unsecured Notes Indenture”), the indenture governing the Existing Secured Notes (the “Secured Notes Indenture”) and the Indenture, impose or will impose operating and financial restrictions on our activities. These restrictions limit or prohibit our ability and the ability of us and our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: - incur indebtedness or grant liens on our property to secure indebtedness; - dispose of assets or equity; - make acquisitions or investments; - make dividends, distributions or other restricted payments; - effect affiliate transactions; - enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and - enter into mergers, consolidations or sales of substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries. In addition, the Existing Credit Agreement includes a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a total net leverage ratio (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) equal to or less than certain levels set forth in the Existing Credit Agreement. These restrictions on our ability to operate our business could seriously harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities. Further, various risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our financing agreements could result in an event of default under those agreements and under any other agreements containing cross-default provisions. Such an event of default, if not waived or cured, would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to 19 ----- foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt (including the Collateral securing the Notes offered hereby, the Existing Secured Notes and the Existing Credit Facilities). Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations, including our obligations under the Existing Credit Agreement. the Unsecured Notes Indenture, the Secured Notes Indenture and the Indenture. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all. _If we default on our obligations under our other indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on the Notes._ Any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under the Indenture, the Existing Credit Agreement, the Unsecured Notes Indenture or the Secured Notes Indenture that is not waived by the required percentage of noteholders or lenders, as applicable, could impede our ability to pay principal and premium amounts, if any, and interest on the Notes and substantially decrease the market value of the Notes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the agreements governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such a default, the holders of such indebtedness in the applicable required percentage could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, lenders under our revolving credit facilities in the applicable required percentage could elect to terminate their commitments and lenders under the Existing Credit Facilities and the holders of the Notes offered hereby and the Existing Notes in the applicable required percentage could institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets that constitute the Collateral, and we may seek protection under the bankruptcy code. If we breach our covenants under the Indenture, the Existing Credit Agreement, the Unsecured Notes Indenture, the Secured Notes Indenture or under any agreements governing future senior credit facilities or other indebtedness, we may need to request waivers from the required percentage of lenders or required percentage of noteholders to avoid being in default. If we are unable to obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, we would be in default under the instrument governing that indebtedness, the lenders or noteholders could exercise their rights as described above, and we may seek protection under the bankruptcy code. _Our ability to service and repay the Notes will be dependent on the cash flow generated by our subsidiaries and events beyond our control._ The Issuer’s only material asset is its interest in its subsidiaries. The Issuer conducts its operations through, and most of its assets are owned by, its subsidiaries, and its operating income and cash flow are generated by its subsidiaries. As a result, repayment of the Notes will depend on our subsidiaries’ generation of cash flow, which will, in turn, depend principally upon future operating performance, and our subsidiaries’ ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. If our operating subsidiaries experience sufficiently adverse changes in its financial position or results of operations, or we otherwise become unable to pay our debts as they become due and obtain further credit, this could result in the commencement of insolvency proceedings. Any such proceedings would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, will affect our ability to make payments on our debt. In particular, due to the seasonal nature of the beauty industry, with the highest levels of consumer demand generally occurring during the holiday buying season in our second fiscal quarter, our subsidiaries’ cash flow in the second half of the fiscal year may be less than in the first half of the fiscal year, which may affect our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations, including to service the Notes offered hereby. In addition, we earn a significant amount of our operating income, and hold a significant portion of our cash and investments, in our foreign subsidiaries outside the United States. As of March 31, 2021, the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the United States by our foreign subsidiaries was $258.3 million. If our U.S. subsidiaries are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, including to service the Notes offered hereby, we may need to repatriate additional earnings and we may be subject to a higher effective tax rate. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, including payments on the Notes, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. Our ability to restructure or refinance 20 ----- our debt will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could result in higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of the Indenture, the Existing Credit Agreement, the Unsecured Notes Indenture, the Secured Notes Indenture or any existing debt instruments or future debt instruments that we may enter into may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. The inability of our subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, including the inability to service the Notes offered hereby, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows or liquidity financial and may impact our ability to satisfy our obligations in respect of the Notes. _We may incur substantially more debt, including secured debt, or take other actions that may affect our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Notes._ Although the terms of the Indenture will restrict, and the terms of the Existing Credit Agreement, the Unsecured Notes Indenture and Secured Notes Indenture restrict, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens securing indebtedness, such restrictions are subject to several exceptions and qualifications. Accordingly, we will be able to incur additional indebtedness, including secured debt, as permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Existing Credit Agreement, the Unsecured Notes Indenture and the Secured Notes Indenture. Such additional indebtedness may be substantial. Our ability to recapitalize, incur additional debt and take a number of other actions that are not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture, the Existing Credit Agreement, the Unsecured Notes Indenture and the Secured Notes Indenture could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the Notes when due, and may also require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our other indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of cash flow to fund our operations, working capital and capital expenditures. In addition, if we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks pari passu in right of payment to the Notes, the holders of that debt will be able to share ratably with the holders of such series of the Notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of us. If our subsidiaries that are not guaranteeing the Notes incur any indebtedness, all of such debt will be structurally senior to the Notes, and the holders of that debt will benefit prior to the holders of the Notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of any such entity. _Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase._ Borrowings under our Existing Credit Facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. As of March 31, 2021, after giving effect to the offering of the Notes offered hereby, the issuance and sale of the Existing Secured Notes, in each case the use of proceeds therefrom and the creation of the New Revolving Credit Facility, $1.0 billion, or approximately 18% of our total debt, would have been at variable rates of interest. We would also have had $2.1 billion of secured borrowings available under our revolving credit facilities. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness referred to above would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. For every 10% increase or decrease in our interest rates, our (Loss) income before income taxes for the twelve month period ended March 31, 2021 would have changed by approximately $3.4 million, assuming that all other variables stayed the same. We are currently party to, and in the future, we may enter into additional, interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments, in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. _Our credit ratings may not reflect the risks of investing in the Notes._ Our credit ratings are an assessment by rating agencies of our ability to pay our debts when due and include many subjective factors. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the value of the Notes. Also, these credit ratings may not reflect the potential impact of risks relating to structure or marketing of the Notes. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating. There can be no assurance that our credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency, if, in that rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant. There can also be no assurance that our credit ratings will reflect all of the factors that would be important to holders of the Notes. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any 21 ----- announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could affect the value of the Notes, may increase our borrowing costs and may negatively impact our ability to incur additional debt. The reports of the rating agencies do not form a part of, and are not incorporated by reference into, this offering memorandum. _Redemption may adversely affect your return on the Notes._ The Notes are redeemable at our option, and therefore we may choose to redeem the Notes at times when prevailing interest rates are relatively low. As a result, you may not be able to reinvest the proceeds you receive from the redemption in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on your Notes being redeemed. _We may not be able to purchase the Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event, which would result in a default under the Indenture and would adversely affect our business and financial condition._ Upon the occurrence of a “Change of Control Triggering Event” within the meaning of the Indenture with respect to the Notes, we will be required to repurchase all or any part of such holder’s Notes of such series at 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the purchase date. We may not have sufficient funds available to make any required repurchases of the Notes, and we may be unable to receive distributions or advances from our subsidiaries in the future sufficient to meet such repurchase obligation. In addition, a change of control triggering event may also accelerate obligations to repurchase amounts outstanding under our and our subsidiaries’ indebtedness and require us (or our subsidiaries), among other things, to make similar offerings in respect of our and their outstanding indebtedness. In addition, restrictions under future debt instruments may not permit us to repurchase the Notes. If we fail to repurchase the Notes in that circumstance, we will be in default under the Indenture. If, due to a default, the repayment of related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay such indebtedness or the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Repurchase of Notes Upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.” _Some significant restructuring transactions may not constitute a change of control triggering event, in which case we would not be obligated to offer to purchase the affected Notes._ Upon the occurrence of a “Change of Control Triggering Event” within the meaning of the Indenture with respect to the Notes, holders of the Notes have the right to require us to purchase their Notes. However, the “Change of Control Triggering Event” provisions will not afford protection to holders of Notes in the event of certain transactions. For example, transactions such as leveraged recapitalizations, refinancings, restructurings or acquisitions initiated by us may not constitute a “Change of Control Triggering Event” requiring us to purchase the Notes. Further, various transactions might not constitute a “Change of Control Triggering Event” under the Notes but could constitute a change of control triggering event as defined under our other debt. In the event of any such transaction, the holders would not have the right to require us to purchase the Notes, even though such transaction could increase the amount of our indebtedness, or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure or any credit ratings, thereby adversely affecting the holders of Notes. _The ability of holders of the Notes to require us to repurchase the Notes as a result of a disposition of “substantially all” assets may be uncertain._ The definition of “Change of Control Triggering Event” in the Indenture will include a phrase relating to sale, lease, transfer or other conveyance, in one or a series of related transactions, of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of the Notes to require us to repurchase such Notes as a result of a sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries taken as a whole to another person or group may be uncertain. _Many of the covenants in the Indenture will not apply to us if the Notes have investment grade ratings from at least two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch and no default has occurred and is continuing._ Many of the covenants in the Indenture will not apply to us if the Notes have investment grade ratings from at least two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch and no default has occurred and is continuing. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever be rated investment grade, or that if they are rated investment grade, that the Notes will maintain 22 ----- these ratings. However, suspension of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in effect. To the extent the covenants are subsequently reinstated, any such actions taken while the covenants were suspended would not result in an event of default under the Indenture. See “Description of Notes—Covenant Suspension.” _A trading market for the Notes may not develop._ The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. In addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” We intend to apply for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of TISE. However, we cannot guarantee that the application to list the Notes on the Official List of TISE will be approved as of the issue date or any date thereafter, that the permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that the listing of the Notes will be maintained, and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing. TISE is not a regulated market for the purposes of MiFID II. The initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. They are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes and any market-making may be discontinued at any time at their sole discretion. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the development or liquidity of any market for the Notes. If a market develops, the Notes could trade at prices that may be lower than the initial offering price of the Notes. Further, if an active market does not develop or is not maintained, the price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. Historically, debt markets have been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The market, if any, for the Notes may not be free from similar disruptions, and any such disruptions may adversely affect the prices at which holders of the Notes may sell their Notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the Notes may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our performance and other factors. _Not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes, and your right to receive payment on the Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries._ Not all of our subsidiaries will be required to guarantee the Notes. The Notes will be guaranteed by the Issuer and the Guarantors, which do not include foreign subsidiaries and certain U.S. subsidiaries excepted from providing guarantees under the terms of the Existing Credit Agreement. Creditors of our non-guarantor subsidiaries will generally be entitled to payment from the assets of those subsidiaries before those assets can be distributed for the benefit of noteholders. As a result, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to the prior payment of all of the existing and future debt and other liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of our non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to the Issuer or the Guarantors of the Notes. Our guarantor subsidiaries, under our Existing Credit Agreement, include our United States subsidiaries other than Younique, LLC (sold in August 2019) and King Kylie, LLC (acquired in January 2020). For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 and nine months ended March 31, 2021, the U.S. Subsidiaries had net revenues to third parties from continuing operations of $1,234 million and $1,069 million, respectively. In addition, as of June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2021, the U.S. Subsidiaries had Long-lived Assets of $3,118 million and $2,979 million, respectively. Long-lived Assets include property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets. Unless they are Guarantors, our subsidiaries will not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions or debt repayments to enable us to make payments in respect of the Notes. Each such subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and may be subject to legal or contractual restrictions that, under certain circumstances, may limit our ability to obtain cash from them. In the event that we do not receive sufficient cash from our subsidiaries, we will be unable to make required principal, premium, if any, and interest payments on the Notes. _There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the Notes. In addition, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to registration rights, and we do not currently intend to register the Notes under applicable securities laws._ The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to exemptions from registration under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the Notes in the United States only in a transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time. You may 23 ----- not offer or sell the Notes except under an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and we do not intend to register the Notes for resale or to offer to exchange the Notes for registered notes under the Securities Act. By purchasing the Notes, you will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgements, representations and agreements as set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.” _Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to avoid the Notes and the guarantees, to require holders of the Notes to return payments received from us or the Guarantors, and to take other actions detrimental to the holders of the Notes._ Federal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes may apply to the issuance of the Notes, the delivery of any guarantees of the Notes, including the guarantees by the Guarantors entered into upon issuance of the Notes, and any subsidiary guarantees that may be entered into thereafter under the terms of the Indenture. Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the issuance of the Notes and the delivery of guarantees could be avoided (that is, canceled) as fraudulent transfers or conveyances if a court determined that we, at the time we issued the Notes, or any of the Guarantors, at the time it delivered the applicable guarantee (or, in some jurisdictions, at the time payment became due under the Notes or a guarantee), (I) issued the Notes or provided the applicable guarantee, as the case may be, with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding any present or future creditor; or (II) (A) received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for issuing the Notes or providing such guarantee, as the case may be, and (B) (1) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such issuance or provision, (2) was engaged in a business or transaction for which the Issuer’s or such Guarantor’s remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital, or (3) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they matured. A court would likely find that the Issuer or a Guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the Notes or the applicable guarantee if the Issuer or such Guarantor did not benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes or such guarantee. As a general matter, subject to the standards noted above, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or an antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. If the Notes or guarantees are avoided or limited under fraudulent transfer or other laws, any claim you may make against the Issuer or the Guarantors for amounts payable on the Notes or guarantees, as the case may be, will be unenforceable to the extent of such avoidance or limitation. We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether the Issuer or a Guarantor was solvent at the relevant time that, if applicable in a particular jurisdiction, may be when payment became due under the Notes or a guarantee. Regardless of the actual standard applied by the court, we cannot be certain that the issuance of the Notes or a guarantee would not be avoided. The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, the Issuer or a Guarantor would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the value of its property, at a fair valuation; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. To the extent that a court avoids or otherwise finds the Notes or a guarantee unenforceable for any other reason, your claims against the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor would be eliminated or limited. In addition, the court might 24 ----- direct you to repay any amounts already received from the Issuer or such Guarantor. Further, the avoidance of the Notes or a related guarantee could result in an event of default with respect to our other debt that, in turn, could result in acceleration of such debt. In certain circumstances, a court may subordinate claims in respect of the Notes or a guarantee to all other debts of an Issuer or a Guarantor, or take other actions detrimental to the noteholders, based on equitable or other grounds. We cannot be certain as to the standards that a court might apply and whether it might find such subordination or other actions appropriate. If a guarantee were legally challenged, such guarantee could also be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the Guarantor, the obligations of the Guarantor were incurred for less than fair consideration. A court could thus avoid the obligations under the guarantee. Although each guarantee will contain a provision intended to limit that Guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer, that provision may not be effective to protect those guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce that Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless. Even if the guarantees of the Notes remain in force, the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantee may not be sufficient to pay the Notes in full when due. _Because each Guarantor’s liability under its guarantees may be reduced to zero, avoided or released under certain circumstances, you may not receive any payments from some or all of the Guarantors._ You have the benefit of the guarantees of the Guarantors. However, the guarantees by the Guarantors are limited to the maximum amount that the Guarantors are permitted to guarantee under applicable law. As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be reduced to zero, depending on the amount of other obligations of such Guarantor. Further, under the circumstances discussed more fully above, a court under Federal or state fraudulent conveyance and transfer statutes could void the obligations under a guarantee or further subordinate it to all other obligations of the Guarantor. In addition, you will lose the benefit of a particular guarantee if it is released under certain circumstances described under “Description of Notes—Guarantees.” _Holders of the Notes may be subject to the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as possible exchange controls, relating to the U.S. dollar and the euro._ The initial investors in the Notes will be required to pay for the Notes in euro. Neither we nor the initial purchasers will be obligated to assist the initial investors in obtaining euro or in converting other currencies into euro to facilitate the payment of the purchase price for the Notes. An investment in any security denominated in, and all payments with respect to which are to be made in, a currency other than the currency of the country in which an investor in the Notes resides or the currency in which an investor conducts its business or activities (the “investor’s home currency”), entails significant risks not associated with a similar investment in a security denominated in the investor’s home currency. In the case of the Notes offered hereby, these risks may include the possibility of: - significant changes in rates of exchange between the euro and the investor’s home currency; and - the imposition or modification of foreign exchange controls with respect to the euro or the investor’s home currency. We have no control over a number of factors affecting the Notes offered hereby and foreign exchange rates, including economic, financial and political events that are important in determining the existence, magnitude and longevity of these risks and their effects. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates between two currencies result from the interaction over time of many factors directly or indirectly affecting economic and political conditions in the countries issuing such currencies, and economic and political developments globally and in other relevant countries. Foreign currency exchange rates may be affected by, among other factors, existing and expected rates of inflation, existing and expected interest rate levels, the balance of payments between countries, and the extent of the governmental surpluses or deficits in various countries. All of these factors are, in turn, sensitive to the monetary, fiscal and trade policies pursued by the governments of various countries important to international trade and finance. Moreover, the recent global economic volatility and the actions taken or to be taken by various national governments 25 ----- in response to the volatility could significantly affect the exchange rates between the euro and the investor’s home currency. The exchange rate of an investor’s home currency for euro and the fluctuations in the exchange rate that have occurred in the past are not necessarily indicative of the exchange rates or the fluctuations therein that may occur in the future. Depreciation of the euro against the investor’s home currency would result in a decrease in the investor’s home currency equivalent yield on a Note, in the investor’s home currency equivalent of the principal payable at the maturity of that Note and generally in the investor’s home currency equivalent market value of that Note. Appreciation of the euro in relation to the investor’s home currency would have the opposite effects. The European Union or one or more of its member states may, in the future, impose exchange controls and modify any exchange controls imposed, which controls could affect exchange rates, as well as the availability of the euro at the time of payment of principal of, interest on, or any redemption or additional amounts with respect to, the Notes. This description of foreign exchange risks does not describe all the risks of an investment in securities, including, in particular, the Notes, that are denominated or payable in a currency other than an investor’s home currency. You should consult your own financial and legal advisors as to the risks involved in an investment in the Notes. _Trading in the clearing system is subject to minimum denomination requirements._ The Notes will be issued with a minimum denomination of €100,000 and multiple of €1,000 in excess of €100,000. It is possible that the clearing systems may process trades that could result in amounts being held in denominations smaller than the minimum denominations. If definitive Notes are required to be issued in relation to such Notes in accordance with the provisions of the relevant global notes, a holder who does not have the minimum denomination or a multiple of €1,000 in excess of €100,000, as applicable, in its account with the relevant clearing stem at the relevant time may not receive all of its entitlement in the form of definitive Notes unless and until such time as its holding satisfies the minimum denomination requirement. _In a lawsuit for payment on the Notes, an investor may bear currency exchange risk._ The Notes will be governed by New York law. Under New York law, a New York state court rendering a judgment on the Notes would be required to render the judgment in euro. However, the judgment would be converted into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of entry of the judgment. Consequently, in a lawsuit for payment on the Notes, investors would bear currency exchange risk until a New York state court judgment is entered, which could be a long time from the date the judgment is rendered. In courts outside of New York, investors may not be able to obtain a judgment in a currency other than U.S. dollars. For example, a judgment for money in an action based on the Notes in many other U.S. federal or state courts ordinarily would be enforced in the United States only in U.S. dollars. The date used to determine the rate of conversion of euro into U.S. dollars will depend upon various factors, including which court renders the judgment. _The Notes permit us to make payments in U.S. dollars if we are unable to obtain euro._ We will pay the principal of and interest on each Note to the registered holder in euro in immediately available funds, provided that, if on or after the issuance of the Notes, the euro is unavailable to us due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or if the euro is no longer being used by the then-member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, then all payments in respect of the Notes will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to us or so used. In such circumstances, the amount payable on any date in euro will be converted into U.S. dollars at the rate mandated by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board as the close of business on the second business day prior to the relevant payment date or, in the event of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board has not mandated a rate of conversion, on the basis of the then-most recent U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate available on or prior to the second business day prior to the relevant payment date as determined by us in our sole discretion. Any payment in respect of the Notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default under the Notes or the Indenture. See “Description of Notes—Terms of the Notes.” This exchange rate may be materially less favorable than the rate in effect at the time the Notes were issued or as would be determined by applicable law. Such developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could materially adversely affect the value of the Notes and you may lose a significant amount of your investment in the Notes. 26 ----- _Certain considerations relating to book-entry interests._ The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and Clearstream. Interests in the Global Notes (as such term is defined in “Book-Entry, Settlement and Clearance”) will trade in bookentry form only. Unless and until the Notes in definitive registered form are issued in exchange for book-entry interests, owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of the Notes. The common depositary (or its nominee) for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream will be the registered holder of the Global Notes. Payments in respect of the Global Notes representing the Notes (including principal, premium, interest and additional amounts, if any) will be made to the paying agent. The paying agent will then make such payments to the common depositary (or its nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream. The common depositary (or its nominee) will in turn distribute such payments to participants in accordance with its procedures. After payment to the common depositary (or its nominee), we, the Trustee and the paying agent will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and if you are not a participant in Euroclear or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of notes under the Indenture. See “Book-Entry, Settlement and Clearance.” Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream or, if applicable, a participant. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any request actions on a timely basis. Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until notes in definitive registered form are issued in respect of all book entry interests, if you own a book entry interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear or Clearstream. We, the Trustee and the paying agent cannot assure you that the procedures to be implemented through Euroclear or Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes. See “Book-Entry, Settlement and Clearance.”\n",
