**_Suitability of investment in the Bonds_**

_The Bonds may not be a suitable investment for all investors. Each potential investor in the Bonds must_
_determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular, each potential_
_investor should:_

_(a)_ _have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Bonds, the merits_
_and risks of investing in the Bonds and the information contained or incorporated by reference in_
_this Prospectus or any applicable supplement;_

_(b)_ _have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its_
_particular financial situation, an investment in the Bonds and the impact the Bonds will have on its_
_overall investment portfolio;_

_(c)_ _have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the Bonds,_
_including where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from the potential_
_investor's currency;_

_(d)_ _understand thoroughly the terms of the Bonds and be familiar with the behaviour of financial_
_markets;_

_(e)_ _be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for_
_economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the_
_applicable risks; and_

_(f)_ _consult their legal advisers in relation to possible legal, tax, accounting, regulatory and related_
_aspects of any investment in the Bonds._

**_Consideration on taxation and the Financial Transactions Tax (“FTT”)_**

_Potential purchasers and sellers of the Bonds should be aware that they may be required to pay taxes or_
_other documentary charges or duties in accordance with the laws and practices of the country where the_
_Bonds are transferred or other jurisdictions. In some jurisdictions, no official statements of the tax_
_authorities or court decisions may be available for financial instruments such as the Bonds. In particular,_
_potential investors are warned that the tax laws of the investor’s jurisdiction or of France (the Issuer’s_
_country of incorporation) might have an impact on the income received from the Bonds. Potential investors_
_are advised not to rely upon the tax summary contained in this Prospectus but to ask for their own tax_
_adviser’s advice on their individual taxation with respect to the acquisition, holding, sale and redemption of_
_the Bonds. Only these advisors are in a position to duly consider the specific situation of each potential_
_investor._

_A number of Member States of the European Union are currently negotiating to introduce a FTT in the_
_scope of which transactions in the Bonds may fall. The scope of any such tax is still uncertain as well as_
_any potential timing of implementation. If the currently discussed text or any similar tax is adopted,_
_transactions in the Bonds could be subject to higher costs, and the liquidity of the market for the Bonds_
_may be diminished. The Issuer or any Paying Agent will in any case not be required to pay or indemnify the_
_Bondholders for any cost incurred as the case may be in respect of the FTT._

**_See “Risk Factors” below for certain information relevant to an investment in the Bonds._**

_In this Prospectus, unless otherwise specified, references to a “Member State” are references to a Member_
_State of the European Economic Area, references to “EUR”, “Euro”, “euro” or “€” are to the single_
_currency introduced at the start of the third stage of European Economic and Monetary Union pursuant to_
_the Treaty establishing the European Community, as amended._

_In connection with the issue of the Bonds, Société Générale (the “Stabilising Manager”) may over-allot_
_Bonds or effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the Bonds at a level higher than_
_that which might otherwise prevail. However, stabilisation may not necessarily occur. Any stabilisation_
_action may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offer of the_
_Bonds is made and, if begun, may cease at any time, but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days_
_after the Issue Date and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Bonds. Any stabilisation action or_
_over-allotment must be conducted by the relevant Stabilising Manager in accordance with all applicable_
_laws and regulations._

**_Forward-Looking Statements_**

_This Prospectus contains certain statements that are forward-looking including statements with respect to_
_the Issuer’s and the Group's business strategies, expansion and growth of operations, trends in the_
_business, competitive advantage, and technological and regulatory changes, information on exchange rate_
_risk and generally includes all statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words “believe”,_
_“expect”, “project”, “anticipate”, “seek”, “estimate” or similar expressions. Such forward-looking_
_statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results_
_may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Potential_
_investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of_
_the date hereof._

**RISK FACTORS**

_The following are risk factors of the offering of the Bonds of which prospective investors should be_
_aware._

_The Issuer believes that the following factors may affect its ability to fulfil its obligations under the_
_Bonds. All of these factors are contingencies which may or may not occur. Factors which the Issuer_
_believes may be material for the purpose of assessing the market risks associated with Bonds are also_
_described below. The Issuer believes that the factors described below represent the principal risks_
_inherent in investing in Bonds, but the inability of the Issuer to pay interest, principal or other_
_amounts on or in connection with any Bonds may occur for other reasons. Prospective investors_
_should make their own independent evaluations of all risk factors and should also read the detailed_
_information set out elsewhere in this Prospectus (including any information incorporated by reference_
_therein) and reach their own views prior to making any investment decision. In each category below_
_the Issuer sets out first the most material risk, in its assessment, taking into account the expected_
_magnitude of their negative impact and the probability of their occurrence._

_The terms defined in “Terms and Conditions of the 2024 Bonds” and “Terms and Conditions of the_
_2028 Bonds” (together, the “Terms and Conditions of the Bonds”) shall have the same meaning_
_where used below._

**1. Risks related to the Issuer**

Risk factors relating to the Issuer and the Group are set out in pages 42 to 52 of the 2019 Universal
Registration Document (as defined in “Documents incorporated by reference”).

**2. Risks related to the Bonds**

**2.1 Risks relating to particular features of the Bonds**

**_2.1.1 The Bonds may be redeemed prior to maturity_**

The Issuer reserves the right to purchase Bonds in the open market or otherwise at any price in
accordance with applicable regulations. Such transactions shall have no impact on the normal
repayment schedule of outstanding Bonds, but they decrease the yield of the Bonds so purchased and
then redeemed by the Issuer prior to their stated maturity and potentially reduce the liquidity of the
Bonds. As a consequence, Bondholders may not be able to sell their Bonds and therefore lose part of
their investment in the Bonds.

In the event that the Issuer would be obliged to pay additional amounts payable in respect of any
Bonds due to any withholding as provided in each Condition 4(b), the Issuer may redeem all
outstanding Bonds in accordance with such Condition.

In addition, the Issuer has the option to redeem all (but not some only) of the Bonds (i) at any time
prior to 11 January 2024 in respect of the 2024 Bonds and 11 November 2027 in respect of the 2028
Bonds, at the relevant make-whole redemption amount, as provided in each Condition 4(c) and (ii)
from and including 11 January 2024 to but excluding the 2024 Maturity Date in respect of the 2024
Bonds and 11 November 2027 to but excluding the 2028 Maturity Date in respect of the 2028 Bonds,
at par plus their respective accrued interest, as provided in each Condition 4(e).

If 80 per cent. or more in principal amount of the 2024 Bonds or of the 2028 Bonds have been
redeemed or purchased and cancelled by the Issuer the Issuer will have the option to redeem all of
such remaining Bonds at their principal amount together with their respective accrued interest as
provided in each Condition 4(f). In particular, there is no obligation for the Issuer to inform investors
if and when this percentage has been reached or is about to be reached, and the Issuer’s right to

A43673267
8


-----

redeem will exist notwithstanding that immediately prior to the serving of a notice in respect of the
exercise of this option, the Bonds may have been trading significantly above par, thus potentially
resulting in a loss of capital invested.

If the market interest rates decrease, the risk to Bondholders that the Issuer will exercise its right of
early redemption increases. As a consequence, the yields received upon such early redemption may be
lower than expected, and the redeemed face amount of the Bonds may be lower than the purchase
price paid for such Bonds by the Bondholder where the purchase price was above par. Therefore, part
of the capital invested by the Bondholder may be lost, so that the Bondholder in such case would not
receive the total amount of the capital invested. However, the redeemed face amount of the Bonds
may not be below par.

In the event the Issuer redeems the Bonds as provided in each Condition 4, an investor generally
would not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds at an effective interest rate as high as the
interest rate on the Bonds being redeemed and may only be able to do so at a significantly lower rate.
Potential investors should consider reinvestment risk in light of other investments available at that
time.

**_2.1.2 Change of control put option_**

In accordance with each Condition 4(d), upon the occurrence of a Change of Control of the Issuer,
each Bondholder will have the right to request the Issuer to redeem or procure the purchase of all or
part of its Bonds at their principal amount together with any accrued interest.

Depending on the number of Bonds in respect of which such put option is exercised, any trading
market in respect of those Bonds in respect of which such put option is not exercised may become
illiquid. In addition, investors may not be able to reinvest the moneys they receive upon such early
redemption in securities with the same yield as the redeemed Bonds. Should the above risks ever
materialise, Bondholders could lose a significant part of their investment in the Bonds.

**_2.1.3 Interest rate risks_**

As provided for in Condition 3 of the Terms and Conditions of the 2024 Bonds, each 2024 Bond bears
interest from, and including, 11 February 2021 at the rate of 0.750 per cent. per annum and in
Condition 3 of the Terms and Conditions of the 2028 Bonds, each 2028 Bond bears interest from, and
including, 11 February 2021 at the rate of 1.875 per cent. per annum, which involves the risk that
subsequent changes in market interest rates may adversely affect the value of the Bonds. Generally,
prices of fixed interest rate notes tend to fall when market interest rates rise and accordingly are
subject to volatility. Therefore, the price of the Bonds at any particular time may be lower than the
purchase price for the Bonds paid by the Bondholders and may cause Bondholders to lose a portion of
the capital invested if they decide to sell their Bonds.

**2.2 Risks for the Bondholders as creditors of the Issuer**

**_2.2.1 French insolvency law_**

As a société anonyme incorporated in France, French insolvency laws shall apply to the Issuer.

Under French insolvency law, holders of debt securities are automatically grouped into a single
assembly of holders (the “Assembly”) in order to defend their common interests if a safeguard
procedure (procédure de sauvegarde), an accelerated safeguard procedure (procédure de sauvegarde
_accélérée), an accelerated financial safeguard procedure (procédure de sauvegarde financière_
_accélérée) is opened in France with respect to the Issuer or, if a reorganisation plan is contemplated,_
as part of a judicial reorganisation procedure (procédure de redressement judiciaire) opened in respect

A43673267
9


-----

thereof. The Assembly will comprise all holders of debt securities issued by the Issuer (including the
Bonds) regardless of their governing law.

The Assembly will deliberate on the proposed safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde),
proposed accelerated safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde accélérée), proposed accelerated
financial safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde financière accélérée) or proposed judicial
reorganisation plan (projet de plan de redressement) prepared in relation to the Issuer and may notably
agree to:

(g) increase the liabilities (dettes) of such holders of debt securities (including the Bondholders) by
rescheduling due payments and/or partially or totally writing off debts of the Issuer;

(h) establish a differentiated treatment between holders of debt securities (including the
Bondholders) only if the difference in situations so justifies; and/or

decide to convert debt securities (including the Bonds) into securities that give or may give right to
share capital.

Decisions of the Assembly will be taken by a two-third majority (calculated as a proportion of the
amount of debt securities held by the holders casting a vote at such Assembly). No quorum is required
to convoke the Assembly. The holders whose rights are not modified by the proposed plan do not
participate in the vote.

For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions relating to the Masse described in each Condition 8 will not
be applicable to the extent they are not in compliance with compulsory insolvency law provisions that
apply in these circumstances.

The procedures, as described above or as they will or may be amended, could have a material and
adverse impact on the Bondholders seeking repayment in the event that the Issuer or its subsidiaries
were to be subject to French insolvency proceedings. It should be noted that Directive (EU)
2019/1023 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on
measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge
of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 has been adopted on 20 June 2019. Once transposed
into French law (which should happen by 17 July 2021 at the latest), such directive should have a
material impact on French insolvency law, especially with regard to the process of adoption of
restructuring plans under insolvency proceedings.

In case of insolvency proceedings opened in respect of the Issuer and governed by French law, as
amended further to the transposition of the said directive by the French authorities, it cannot be
excluded that the Bondholders will no longer deliberate on the proposed restructuring plan in a
separate assembly, meaning that they will no longer benefit from a specific veto power on this plan.
Instead, as any other affected parties, the Bondholders may be grouped into one or several classes
(with potentially other types of creditors) and their dissenting vote may possibly be overridden by a
cross-class cram down, where applicable.

The commencement of insolvency proceedings against the Issuer could have a material adverse effect
on the market value of Bonds issued by the Issuer. Any decisions taken by the Assembly or a class of
affected parties, as the case may be, could negatively and significantly impact the Bondholders and
cause them to lose all or part of their investment in the Bonds, should they not be able to recover all or
part of the amounts due to them from the Issuer.

**_2.2.2 Modification of the Terms and Conditions of the Bonds and waivers_**

As provided by each Condition 8, there are provisions for calling meetings of Bondholders or
consulting Bondholders in writing to consider matters affecting their interests generally. These

A43673267

-----

provisions permit defined majorities to bind all Bondholders including Bondholders who did not
express a vote and Bondholders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority. If a decision is
adopted by a majority of Bondholders and such modifications were to impair or limit the rights of the
Bondholders, this may have an impact on the market value of the Bonds and hence Bondholders may
lose part of their investment in the Bonds.

**2.3 Risks relating to the market**

**_2.3.1 No active secondary or market trading for the Bonds_**

Application has been made for the Bonds to be admitted to trading on the official list of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange as from the Issue Date.

An investment in the Bonds should be considered primarily with a view to holding them until their
maturity. The Bonds may have no established trading market when issued, and one may never
develop. If an active trading market for the Bonds does not develop or is not maintained, the market or
trading price and liquidity of the Bonds may be significantly adversely affected. If a market does
develop, it may not be very liquid.

Therefore, investors may not be able to sell their Bonds in the secondary market in which case the
market or trading price and liquidity may be adversely affected or at prices that will provide them with
a yield comparable to similar investments that have a developed secondary market and Bondholders
could lose a significant part of their investments in the Bonds.

**_2.3.2 Market value of the Bonds_**

The market value of the Bonds will be affected by the creditworthiness of the Issuer and by a number
of additional factors related to economic and market conditions, including, but not limited to,
volatility of the market, interest rates, currency exchange rates and inflation rates and the time
remaining to the maturity date.

The value of the Bonds depends on a number of interrelated factors, including economic, financial and
political events in France or elsewhere, including factors affecting capital markets generally and the
stock exchanges on which the Bonds are traded. The price at which a holder of Bonds will be able to
sell the Bonds prior to maturity may be at a discount, which could be substantial, from the issue price
or the purchase price paid by such purchaser. There can be no assurance that events in France, in
Europe or elsewhere will not cause market volatility or that such volatility will not adversely affect
the price of the Bonds or that economic and market conditions will not have any other adverse effect.
Accordingly, all or part of the investment by the Bondholder in the Bonds may be lost upon any
transfer of the Bonds, so that the Bondholder in such case would receive significantly less than the
total amount of its investment.

**_2.3.3 Exchange rate risks and exchange controls_**

The Issuer will pay principal and interest on the Bonds in Euro in accordance with each Condition 3
and each Condition 5. This presents certain risks relating to currency conversions if an investor’s
financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or currency unit (the “Investor’s
**Currency”) other than Euro. These include the risk that exchange rates may change significantly**
(including changes due to devaluation of Euro or revaluation of the Investor’s Currency) and the risk
that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor’s Currency may impose or modify exchange
controls. An appreciation in the value of the Investor’s Currency relative to the Euro would decrease
(i) the Investor’s Currency-equivalent yield on the Bonds, (ii) the Investor’s Currency-equivalent
value of the principal payable on the Bonds and (iii) the Investor’s Currency-equivalent market value
of the Bonds, all of which could have a significant adverse effect on the return on the investment of
the investors.

A43673267
11


-----

Government and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls
that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate. As a result, investors may receive less interest
or principal than expected, or no interest or principal. This may result in a significant loss on any
capital invested from the perspective of a Bondholder whose domestic currency is not Euro.

**_2.3.4 Potential conflict of interest_**

Certain of the Joint Lead Managers (as defined in “Subscription and Sale” below) and, as the case
may be, the Calculation Agent and their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in
investment banking and/or commercial banking transactions with, and may perform services for, the
Issuer and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business. In particular, certain Joint Lead Managers
took part in the financing of the Acquisition (as defined in the section headed “Recent Developments”
below). In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Joint Lead Managers and
their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity
securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their
own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may
involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or Issuer’s affiliates. Certain of the Joint Lead
Managers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Issuer or other entities of the
Group routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer or, as the case may be, such other entities of
the Group consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Joint Lead
Managers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist
of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities, including
potentially the Bonds. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the
Bonds. The Joint Lead Managers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations
and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial
instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in
such securities and instruments.

Potential conflicts of interest may arise between the Calculation Agent, if any, and the Bondholders
(including where a Joint Lead Manager acts as Calculation Agent), including with respect to certain
discretionary determinations and judgements that such Calculation Agent may make pursuant to the
Terms and Conditions of the Bonds that may influence the amount receivable upon redemption of the
Bonds. In particular, whilst a Calculation Agent will, as the case may be, have information barriers
and procedures in place to manage conflicts of interest, it may in its other banking activities from time
to time be engaged in transactions involving an index or related derivatives which may affect amounts
receivable by Bondholders during the term and on the maturity of the Bonds or the market price,
liquidity or value of the Bonds and which could be deemed to be adverse to the interests of the
Bondholders.

**TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE 2024 BONDS**

_The terms and conditions of the 2024 Bonds will be as follows:_

The issue of €600,000,000 0.750 per cent. Bonds due 11 February 2024 (the “Bonds”) of Iliad (the
“Issuer”) has been authorised by resolutions of the Board of Directors (Conseil d’administration) of
the Issuer dated 9 December 2020 and 4 February 2021. The Issuer will enter into a fiscal agency
agreement (the “Fiscal Agency Agreement”) dated 9 February 2021 with Société Générale as fiscal
agent, principal paying agent and calculation agent. The fiscal agent, principal paying agent, the
calculation agent and paying agents for the time being are referred to in these Conditions as the
“Fiscal Agent”, the “Principal Paying Agent”, the “Calculation Agent” and the “Paying Agents”
(which expression shall include the Principal Paying Agent), each of which expression shall include
the successors from time to time of the relevant persons, in such capacities, under the Fiscal Agency
Agreement, and are collectively referred to as the “Agents”. References to “Conditions” are, unless
the context otherwise requires, to the numbered paragraphs below.

## 1 Form, Denomination and Title

The Bonds are issued on 11 February 2021 (the “Issue Date”) in dematerialised bearer form in the
denomination of €100,000. Title to the Bonds will be evidenced in accordance with Articles L.211-3
and R.211-1 of the French _Code monétaire et financier by book-entries (inscription en compte). No_
physical document of title (including _certificats représentatifs pursuant to Article R.211-7 of the_
French Code monétaire et financier) will be issued in respect of the Bonds.

The Bonds will, upon issue, be inscribed in the books of Euroclear France, which shall credit the
accounts of the Account Holders. For the purpose of these Conditions, “Account Holders” shall mean
any intermediary institution entitled to hold accounts, directly or indirectly, with Euroclear France,
and includes Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and the depositary bank for Clearstream Banking,
S.A. (“Clearstream”).

Title to the Bonds shall be evidenced by entries in the books of Account Holders and will pass upon,
and transfer of Bonds may only be effected through, registration of the transfer in such books.

## 2 Status and Negative Pledge

_(a)_ _Status of the Bonds_

The obligations of the Issuer in respect of the Bonds constitute direct, unconditional, unsecured
(subject to Condition 2(b)) and unsubordinated obligations and rank and will rank pari passu
and without any preference among themselves and (subject to such exceptions as are from time
to time mandatory under French law) equally and rateably with all other present or future
unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer.

_(b)_ _Negative Pledge_

So long as any of the Bonds remain outstanding (as defined below), the Issuer will not, and
will ensure that none of Free (as defined below) or Free Mobile (as defined below) will not,
create or permit to subsist any mortgage, lien (other than a lien arising by operation of law),
charge, pledge or other form of security interest (sûreté réelle) upon any of their respective
business, revenues, property or assets, present or future, to secure any Relevant Debt (as
defined below) unless at the same time or prior thereto, the Issuer’s obligations under the
Bonds are equally and rateably secured therewith.

A43673267
20


-----

For the purposes of these Conditions:

“Free Mobile” means Free Mobile, a company incorporated as a French _société par actions_
_simplifiée registered with the Registre du commerce et des sociétés_ of Paris under number
499 247 138.

“Free” means Free, a company incorporated as a French _société par actions simplifiée_
registered with the Registre du commerce et des sociétés of Paris under number 421 938 861.

“Group” means the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries.

“outstanding” means, in relation to the Bonds, all the Bonds issued other than: (a) those which
have been redeemed in accordance with the Conditions, (b) those in respect of which the date
for redemption in accordance with the Conditions has occurred and the redemption monies
(including all interest accrued on such Bonds to the date for such redemption and any interest
payable under Condition 3 after such date) have been duly paid to the Fiscal Agent and
(c) those which have been purchased and cancelled as provided in Condition 4.

“Relevant Debt” means any present or future indebtedness for borrowed money in the form of,
or represented by, bonds or notes (obligations) or other similar debt securities (titres de
_créance excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, titres de créance négociables) which are for the_
time being, or are capable of being, quoted, admitted to trading or ordinarily dealt in on any
stock exchange, over-the-counter market or other securities market.

## 3 Interest

The Bonds bear interest at the rate of 0.750 per cent. per annum, from and including 11 February 2021
(the “Interest Commencement Date”) payable annually in arrear on 11 February in each year (each
an “Interest Payment Date”), commencing on 11 February 2022. The period commencing on, and
including, the Interest Commencement Date and ending on, but excluding, the first Interest Payment
Date and each successive period commencing on, and including, an Interest Payment Date and ending
on, but excluding, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date is called an “Interest Period”.

Bonds will cease to bear interest from the date provided for their redemption, unless payment of the
full amount due in respect of the Bonds is improperly withheld or refused on said date. In such event,
the Bonds will continue to bear interest in accordance with this Condition (as well after as before
judgment) on the principal amount of such Bonds until whichever is the earlier of (i) the day on which
all sums due in respect of such Bonds up to that day are received by or on behalf of the relevant holder
and (ii) the day after the Fiscal Agent has notified the holders of the Bonds (the “Bondholders”) in
accordance with Condition 9 of receipt of all sums due in respect of all the Bonds up to that day.

Interest will be calculated on an Actual/Actual (ICMA) basis. If interest is required to be calculated
for a period of less than one year, it will be calculated on the basis of a day count fraction which will
be calculated by taking the number of days in the relevant period, from and including the date from
which interest begins to accrue to but excluding the date on which it falls due, divided by the number
of days in the Interest Period in which the relevant period falls (including the first such day but
excluding the last).

## 4 Redemption and Purchase

The Bonds may not be redeemed otherwise than in accordance with this Condition 4.

A43673267
21


-----

_(a)_ _Final Redemption_

Unless previously redeemed or purchased and cancelled as provided below, the Bonds will be
redeemed by the Issuer at their principal amount on 11 February 2024 (the “Maturity Date”).

_(b)_ _Redemption for Taxation Reasons_

(i) If, by reason of a change in French law or regulation, or any change in the official
application or interpretation of such law or regulation, becoming effective after the Issue Date,
the Issuer would on the occasion of the next payment due in respect of the Bonds, not be able
to make such payment without having to pay additional amounts as specified in Condition 6
below, the Issuer may on any Interest Payment Date, subject to having given not more than 45
nor less than 30 days’ prior notice to the Bondholders (which notice shall be irrevocable), in
accordance with Condition 9, redeem all, but not some only, of the outstanding Bonds at their
principal amount together, if applicable, with interest accrued to the date of such redemption,
provided that the due date for redemption of which notice hereunder may be given shall be no
earlier than the latest practicable Interest Payment Date on which the Issuer could make
payment of principal and interest without withholding for French taxes.

(ii) If the Issuer would on the occasion of the next payment in respect of the Bonds be
prevented by French law or regulation from making payment to the Bondholders of the full
amount then due and payable, notwithstanding the undertaking to pay additional amounts
contained in Condition 6 below, then the Issuer shall forthwith give notice of such fact to the
Fiscal Agent and the Issuer shall upon giving not less than seven days’ prior notice to the
Bondholders in accordance with Condition 9 redeem all, but not some only, of the Bonds then
outstanding at their principal amount plus any accrued interest on the latest practicable date on
which the Issuer could make payment of the full amount payable in respect of the Bonds
without withholding for French taxes, or, if such date is past, as soon as practicable thereafter.

_(c)_ _Redemption at the option of the Issuer_

The Issuer may, subject to compliance with all relevant laws, regulations and directives and to
having given not more than 30 nor less than 15 days' notice to the Bondholders (which notice
shall be irrevocable and shall specify the date fixed for redemption) in accordance with
Condition 9, redeem all (but not some only) of the Bonds at any time prior to 11 January 2024
(the “Make-Whole Redemption Date”) at an amount per Bond equal to the greater of:

(a) 100 per cent. of the principal amount of the Bonds; or

(b) as determined by the Calculation Agent (as defined below), the sum of the then current
values of (i) the of principal amount of the Bonds and (ii) the remaining scheduled payments of
interest from the Make-Whole Redemption Date to, and including, 11 January 2024
(determined on the basis of the interest applicable to such Bond, excluding any interest accrued
on the Bonds from and including the Issue Date or, as the case may be, the scheduled Interest
Payment Date immediately preceding such Make-Whole Redemption Date to, but excluding,
the Make-Whole Redemption Date) discounted to the Make-Whole Redemption Date on an
annual basis (based on the actual number of days elapsed divided by 365 or (in the case of a
leap year) by 366) at the Reference Dealer Rate (as defined below) plus 0.25 per cent.,

_(d)_ _Redemption at the option of Bondholders following a Change of Control_

If at any time while any Bond remains outstanding, there occurs a Change of Control (as
defined below), the holder of such Bond will have the option (the “Put Option”) within the
Put Option Period (as defined below) (unless, prior to the giving of the Put Event Notice, the
Issuer gives notice of its intention to redeem the Bonds under Conditions 4(b) (Redemption for
taxation reasons), 4(c) (Redemption at the option of the Issuer) or 4(e) (Residual Maturity Call

that Bond, on the Optional Redemption Date at its principal amount together with (or where
purchased, together with an amount equal to) interest accrued to, but excluding, the Optional
Redemption Date.

A “Change of Control” shall be deemed to have occurred each time that any person (or group
of persons acting in concert (having the meaning given in Article L.233-10 of the French Code
_de commerce)), other than Xavier Niel, together with his spouse or domestic partner, his_
descendants and/or any holding company controlled by any one or more or them, controls or

specifying the nature of the Change of Control, the circumstances giving rise to it, the Put

Paying Agent (a “Put Option Notice”) and in which the Bondholder may specify a bank
account to which payment is to be made under this Condition 4(d).

A Put Option Notice once given shall be irrevocable. The Issuer shall redeem or, at the option
of the Issuer procure the purchase of, the Bonds in respect of which the Put Option has been
validly exercised as provided above and subject to the transfer of such Bonds to the account of
the Fiscal Agent for the account of the Issuer, on the date which is the fifth business day
following the end of the Put Option Period (the “Optional Redemption Date”). Payment in
respect of such Bonds will be made in Euro on the Optional Redemption Date by transfer to
the bank account specified in the Put Option Notice and otherwise subject to the provisions of
Condition 5.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer shall have no responsibility for any cost or loss of
whatever kind which the Bondholder may incur as a result of or in connection with such
Bondholder’s exercise or purported exercise of, or otherwise in connection with, any Put
Option (whether as a result of any purchase or redemption arising there from or otherwise).

_(e)_ _Residual Maturity Call Option_

The Issuer may, subject to compliance with all relevant laws, regulations and directives and to
having given not more than 30 nor less than 15 days' irrevocable notice to the Bondholders
(which notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the date fixed for redemption) in
accordance with Condition 9, redeem all (but not some only) of the Bonds at par together with
interest accrued to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption at any time as from 11 January
2024.

_(f)_ _Clean-Up Call Option_

If 80 per cent. or more in principal amount of the Bonds have been redeemed or purchased and
cancelled by the Issuer, the Issuer may, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice to the
Bondholders, redeem on a date to be specified in such notice (the “Clean-Up Redemption
**Date”), at its option, all (but not some only) of the remaining Bonds at their principal amount,**
together with interest accrued to but excluding the Clean-Up Redemption Date.

_(g)_ _Purchases_

The Issuer may at any time purchase Bonds together with rights to interest relating thereto in

_(h)_ _Cancellation_

All Bonds which are redeemed or purchased by the Issuer for cancellation pursuant to this
Condition will forthwith be cancelled and accordingly may not be reissued or sold.

## 5 Payments

_(a)_ _Method of Payment_

Payments of principal and interest in respect of the Bonds will be made in Euro by credit or
transfer to a Euro-denominated account (or any other account to which Euro may be credited or
transferred) specified by the payee in a city in which banks have access to the TARGET
System. “TARGET System” means the Trans European Automated Real Time Gross
Settlement Express Transfer (known as TARGET2) System or any successor thereto.

Such payments shall be made for the benefit of the Bondholders to the Account Holders and all
payments validly made to such Account Holders in favour of the Bondholders will be an
effective discharge of the Issuer and the Paying Agents, as the case may be, in respect of such
payments.

Payments of principal and interest on the Bonds will, in all cases, be subject to any fiscal or
other laws and regulations applicable thereto in the place of payment, but without prejudice to
the provisions of Condition 6.

_(b)_ _Payments on Business Days_

If any due date for payment of principal or interest in respect of any Bond is not a Business
Day (as defined below), then the Bondholder thereof shall not be entitled to payment of the
amount due until the next following day which is a Business Day and the Bondholder shall not
be entitled to any interest or other sums in respect of such postponed payment.

In this Condition “Business Day” means any day, not being a Saturday or a Sunday on which
the TARGET System is operating and on which Euroclear France is open for general business.

No commission or expenses shall be charged to the Bondholders in respect of such payments.

The names of the initial Agents and their specified offices are set out below.

The Issuer reserves the right at any time to vary or terminate the appointment of the Fiscal
Agent, Paying Agent, Calculation Agent and/or appoint additional or other Paying Agents or
approve any change in the office through which any such Agent acts, provided that there will at
all times be a Fiscal Agent and a Principal Paying Agent having a specified office in a
European city. Notice of any such change or any change of specified office shall promptly be
given to the Bondholders in accordance with Condition 9.

## 6 Taxation

_(a)_ _Withholding Tax Exemption_

All payments of principal and interest by or on behalf of the Issuer in respect of the Bonds

assessments or other governmental charges of whatever nature imposed, levied, collected,

A43673267

withheld or assessed by or within France or any authority therein or thereof having power to
tax, unless such withholding or deduction is required by law.

_(b)_ _Additional Amounts_

If, pursuant to French laws or regulations, payments of principal or interest in respect of any
Bond are subject to deduction or withholding in respect of any present or future taxes, duties,
assessments or other governmental charges of whatever nature imposed, levied, collected,
withheld or assessed by or within France or any authority therein or thereof having power to
tax, the Issuer shall, to the fullest extent then permitted by law, pay such additional amounts as
may be necessary in order that the holder of each Bond, after such deduction or withholding,
will receive the full amount then due and payable thereon in the absence of such deduction or
withholding; provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be liable to pay any such additional
amounts in respect of any Bond to, or to a third party on behalf of, a Bondholder who is liable
to such taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges in respect of such Bond by
reason of his having some connection with France other than the mere holding of such Bond.

Any references to these Conditions to principal and interest shall be deemed also to refer to any
additional amounts which may be payable under the provisions of this Condition 6.

## 7 Events of Default

the provisions of Condition 6.

_(b)_ _Payments on Business Days_

If any due date for payment of principal or interest in respect of any Bond is not a Business
Day (as defined below), then the Bondholder thereof shall not be entitled to payment of the
amount due until the next following day which is a Business Day and the Bondholder shall not
be entitled to any interest or other sums in respect of such postponed payment.

Bond are subject to deduction or withholding in respect of any present or future taxes, duties,
assessments or other governmental charges of whatever nature imposed, levied, collected,
withheld or assessed by or within France or any authority therein or thereof having power to
tax, the Issuer shall, to the fullest extent then permitted by law, pay such additional amounts as
may be necessary in order that the holder of each Bond, after such deduction or withholding,
will receive the full amount then due and payable thereon in the absence of such deduction or
withholding; provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be liable to pay any such additional
amounts in respect of any Bond to, or to a third party on behalf of, a Bondholder who is liable
to such taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges in respect of such Bond by
reason of his having some connection with France other than the mere holding of such Bond.

**Press releases**

Press release dated 21 January 2021

**The iliad Group makes 10 pledges to achieve carbon neutrality (net zero emissions) by 2035**

  - Today the iliad Group is publishing its Climate Strategy – the product of two years of collective
work.

  - We have set ourselves ambitious objectives for achieving carbon neutrality in France and Italy,
with three milestones: 2021, 2035 and 2050.

  - We’re making 10 pledges today and plan to invest 1 billion euros over the next 15 years to achieve
carbon neutrality.

Today the iliad Group is publishing its climate strategy. This is the product of two years’ work, which
mobilized 80 Group employees and is rooted in our fundamental values of transparency, efficiency and
solidarity.

The Group has been taking action to limit the impact of its business on the environment for almost ten
years now. However, in view of the climate emergency the planet is currently facing, we firmly believe we
now need to go even further and intend to invest €1 billion over the coming 15 years to achieve carbon
neutrality in France and Italy. As we only acquired the Polish mobile operator, Play, in late 2020, this
strategy does not yet apply to Poland, but work is already underway to include it in the Group’s carbon
assessment process.

**A strategy with 3 milestones**

We’ve set ourselves ambitious objectives to achieve carbon neutrality in France and Italy, with 3
milestones:

  - **By 2021: for 100% of our electricity supplies to come from renewable sources**

Press release dated 18 November 2020

**The EIB and iliad sign a new €300 million loan agreement to finance 4G and 5G network rollouts**

The iliad Group and the European Investment Bank (EIB) have set up a new €300 million loan to help the
Group finance its mobile network rollouts in France, particularly to densify its 4G network and deploy its
5G network.

Having helped to finance iliad’s fixed network rollouts for over ten years now, the EIB is once again
partnering the Group by providing financial support for rolling out its latest-generation mobile networks.
This new loan brings iliad’s total amount of EIB financing to over €1.1 billion since 2009.

At iliad, network rollouts remain an absolute priority. On average, the Group invests almost 30% of its
revenues in its rollouts every year, making a total of nearly €7.5 billion over the last five years. iliad’s
large-scale rollout drive illustrates how deeply committed it is to the objective of giving the whole of
France digital coverage, including in the most rural areas. This commitment can be clearly seen in the
Group’s involvement in the French government’s “New Deal for Mobile” program.

Thanks to its investments, the Group now has more than 18,800 mobile sites across Metropolitan France
and offers 4G coverage to 97.8% of the French population.

“We’re delighted with this partnership with the EIB, which will enable us to actively pursue the rollout and
_densification of our mobile networks. Providing the best connectivity to everyone, nationwide, is what_
_we’re working together to achieve at iliad. We intend to pursue our rollouts at a brisk pace, particularly in_
_view of the upcoming launch of our 5G offers and entry into the B2B market”,_ **said Thomas Reynaud,**
**Chief Executive Officer of the iliad Group.**

“Supporting innovation and the deployment of new technologies is a priority for the European Investment
_Bank. That is why I’m delighted to announce this new loan granted to the iliad Group”,_ **said Ambroise**
**Fayolle, Vice-President of the EIB, adding “In the current health crisis, it is more important than ever for**
_everyone, everywhere, to have access to reliable and high-quality connectivity. By granting this loan to_
_iliad we are supporting the development and appeal of France’s regions, particularly for rural and isolated_
_areas.”_

Thanks to the EIB’s triple-A rating, the loan’s underlying financial terms are very attractive. It also has a
long maturity of up to eight years, which is particularly suited to the type and duration of the Group’s
capital expenditure.

Press release dated 17 November 2020

**Innovation, commercial wins, massive rollouts, and business growth in France: iliad reaffirms its**
**fundamentals in Q3 2020**

The iliad Group reaffirmed its fundamentals in the third quarter of 2020: innovation, with the success of the

large number of subscribers in under three months – as well as renewed demand for the Freebox
Delta.

- **Record high net adds for Fiber, with 299,000 new subscribers in third-quarter 2020 and a Fiber**
subscriber base that has now topped 2.5 million.

**The Group's robust third-quarter performance confirms its structural return to growth in France.**

The solid financial performance in the third quarter of 2020 directly reflects the Group's commercial
success during the period.

- Consolidated revenues rose 6.3% year on year.

- In **France, the Group’s revenues came to €1,252 million, up 1.9% despite a sharp drop in roaming**
revenues during the quarter. In Italy, revenues totaled €171 million, up 56.3% thanks to growth in the
subscriber base.

**The Group’s Fixed and Mobile network rollouts continued at a brisk pace during the quarter.**

- In **France, iliad deployed over 550 new mobile sites and equipped nearly 1,300 sites for 700 MHz.**
The Group now has 18,800 mobile sites across Metropolitan France and offers 4G coverage to 97.8%
of the French population. It is the operator that has rolled out the largest number of new 4G sites in
Metropolitan France since the start of 2020.

- In Italy, iliad deployed some 770 mobile sites in third-quarter 2020, and by October 31 it had reached
its year-end objective of having over 5,000 active sites.

_Freebox Pop and the Free-Ligue 1 Uber Eats app; commercial wins in France and Italy; a fast pace of_
_network rollouts; and growth, with the acquisition of Play. The iliad Group also continues to be a dynamic_

**Consolidated revenues**

The Group’s consolidated revenues rose 6.6% year on year in the first nine months of 2020, led by (i)
ongoing strong sales momentum in Italy (€483 million in revenues for the nine-month period) and (ii) a
1.8% increase in services revenues in France, which offset (iii) a 14.2% decrease in sales of devices.

The table below shows the breakdown of consolidated revenues by category for the nine-month and threemonth periods ended September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019.

**_France_**

The Group’s revenues in France increased 1.9% in the third quarter of 2020 to €1,252 million, with services
revenues rising 2.0% (4.5% excluding the impact of e-books).

_Fixed services revenues_

Services revenues for the Fixed business climbed 1.7% to €673 million in third-quarter 2020. The main
factors underlying this performance were as follows:

   - **A record showing for Fiber, with 299,000 net adds during the quarter. The Group had over**
2.5 million Fiber subscribers and 18.2 million connectible sockets at end-September. The Fiber takeup rate among the Group’s subscriber base is now almost 38%, up by more than 14 points in the
space of 12 months.

A43673267
51


-----

- **Best Fixed net-adds performance since the fourth quarter of 2012, with 99,000 new subscribers in**
third-quarter 2020, thanks to:

`o` **Fiber acting as a tool for winning new subscribers. Over half of those signing up to Free**
Fiber are completely new subscribers (i.e., not switching from other plans), and our new
subscribers in non-densely populated areas have reached a record high, demonstrating the
success of our local communication campaigns.

`o` **An increase in gross sales, reflecting the successful launch of the Freebox Pop and renewed**
demand for the Freebox Delta.

- **A 70-euro-cent year-on year decrease in ARPU to €31.8. Unlike in the third quarter of 2019,**
ARPU was not lifted by the inclusion of the e-book offering. Excluding the impact of e-books,
ARPU rose 0.6%, reflecting the improved customer mix and the effect of subscribers switching to
plans that are not part of promotional deals, the accretive effect of which was partly offset by the
rise in gross sales.

- An 8.1% overall revenue increase for the **B2B segment, representing slower growth than in**
previous quarters. Jaguar Networks' growth accelerated during the period, with revenues up 16.2%,
but this positive effect was partly offset by an unfavorable basis of comparison for Scaleway’s B2B
activities.

_Mobile services revenues_

Following a second quarter that was adversely impacted by the Covid-19 crisis, Mobile services revenues
picked up in the third quarter, rising 2.4% to €537 million. This increase was fueled by a re-acceleration in
growth for revenues invoiced to subscribers, which were up 4% to €439 million. The main factors affecting
Mobile services revenues in third-quarter 2020 were as follows:

- **120,000 net adds for the Group's 4G plans – our best quarterly performance in the past 12 months**
– which pushed up our total 4G subscriber base to more than 8.5 million at end-September. The
Group continued to improve its subscriber mix during the period, and its total mobile subscriber
base increased by a net 70,000 subscribers. At September 30, 2020, the Group had a total of 13.48
million mobile subscribers in France.

- **A robust increase in revenues invoiced to subscribers, which rose almost 4% to €439 million**
(7.2% excluding the impact of e-books), despite a 55% decrease in roaming revenues. This good
performance reflects (i) the Group’s successful strategy of switching subscribers on the voice-based
plan to the Free Mobile Unlimited 4G Plan (50/100 GB for non-Freebox subscribers), (ii) the fact
that a high number of Série Free Plan subscribers are being automatically switched to the Free
Mobile Unlimited 4G Plan after 12 months, and (iii) the lower churn rate. All of these factors drove
a 2.8% increase in ARPU to €10.9 (5.8% increase excluding the impact of e-books).

- A 4.1% **decrease in Other Mobile revenues to €97 million,** **after two quarters of growth.**
Primarily stemming from interconnections between operators for voice and text message services,
these revenues generate low margins and have been adversely affected from a structural standpoint
by a decreasing use of text messages as mobile data usage rises. However, this structural revenue
decrease was halted in the first two quarters of the year due to the higher number of voice calls and
text messages during the national lockdown in France.

- **Ongoing brisk pace of rollouts. During the third quarter, Free deployed over 550 new mobile sites**
and equipped nearly 1,300 sites for 700 MHz. At end-September, the Group had almost 18,800 sites
in Metropolitan France, of which some 17,700 are 4G, with 96% of its 4G sites equipped for 700
MHz. At the same date, the Group’s mobile network covered more than 98.4% of the French
population for 3G and 97.8% for 4G.

A43673267
52


-----

_Revenues from devices_

Sales of devices contracted 2.7% in third-quarter 2020 to €44 million, primarily reflecting an unfavorable
basis of comparison with third-quarter 2019, when the figure was boosted by sales of the Freebox Delta
Player.

**_Italy_**

Revenues generated by the Group in Italy totaled €171 million in third-quarter 2020, up 56% year on year.
The operating context remained difficult during the quarter, despite Italy coming out of lockdown, with the
mobile market still weighed down by the Covid-19 crisis. The main factors underlying performance in Italy
during the third quarter were as follows:

- iliad Italia recorded a very high number of net adds despite ongoing targeted and very aggressivelypriced offerings launched by competitors and the market’s lower churn rate since late February,
when the government introduced its initial restrictions to curb the spread of Covid-19. With 580,000
net adds in the third quarter of 2020, the Group had over 6.8 million subscribers in Italy at endSeptember 2020. Since launching its mobile operations in Italy in late May 2018, the Group has won
**almost 9% of the Italian market.**

- The Group continued to roll out its mobile network during the quarter, deploying some 770 new
sites and reaching a total of nearly 4,780 active sites and 6,640 equipped sites at September 30. At
end-October, iliad Italia had already met its objective of having over 5,000 active sites by the end of
2020.

**_Acquisition of Play_**

On September 21, 2020, the Strategy Committee of HoldCo and the Board of Directors of iliad approved
the launch of a public tender offer for all of the shares making up the capital of the Polish telecom operator,
Play, for a cash amount of PLN 39 per share (representing a total of c. €2.2 billion for 100% of the share
capital and an enterprise value of c €3.5 billion). In parallel, iliad has signed a binding agreement to
purchase a 40% controlling interest from Play’s two reference shareholders for the same unit price (i.e.,
PLN 39 per share), which will give iliad the majority of seats on Play’s Board of Directors.

**_5G frequencies_**

On October 1, 2020, following the end of the principal phase of the 5G spectrum auction carried out in
France, the Group was allocated two blocks of 10 MHz for a total price of €252 million, to be paid over
four years. This is in addition to the 50 MHz block obtained by the Group after making the commitments
specified by ARCEP, in return for a payment of €350 million spread over 15 years. Moreover, from 2021,
the Group will extend its spectrum in the 900 MHz frequency band (+2.6 MHz symmetrical) and in the 2.1
GHz frequency band (+9.8 MHz symmetrical).

**Group objectives**

As well as the human impact, the coronavirus pandemic has generated an economic slowdown in certain
regions. The social and financial impacts for the Group are currently limited but the pandemic could affect
iliad and its objectives, as is the case for all companies in the telecommunications sector. Possible impacts
include the shortage of certain electronic components and a slower rollout of the Group's Fixed and Mobile
networks.

Press release dated 23 October 2020

**The iliad Group (France and Italy) and Cellnex extend their strategic partnership to Poland**

**A move that will finance the rollout of play’s fixed network in Poland and accelerate the rollouts of**
**its 4G/Gg networks**

**Play expected to receive €804 million***

The iliad Group ("iliad") has extended its strategic partnership with Cellnex to cover Play’s mobile
telecommunications passive infrastructure in Poland. This partnership fits seamlessly with the passive
infrastructure sale process announced by Play’s management team and its current shareholders.

iliad has entered into an agreement with Cellnex to sell 60% of the company that will manage Play’s
mobile telecommunications passive infrastructure, covering some 7,000 sites. The agreement will be
transferred to Play when iliad acquires control of Play. The amount expected to be received by Play is
around €804 million[].

The strategic interest of the partnership is twofold. First, it will strengthen the investment capacity of Play,
which is entering a new business development cycle, with (i) the deployment and purchase of
5G frequencies, (ii) the densification of its mobile network to accompany growth in usages, and (iii) a
planned entry into the fixed market.

Second, the partnership will enable Play to keep full control of its network while facilitating a smooth
infrastructure rollout. Consequently, it meets the following two goals:

- Ensuring that Play retains its independence for managing the active components of its networks.

- Increasing the sharing of passive infrastructure between telecommunications operators at a time
when a balance has to be struck between the need for denser infrastructure and controlling the
environmental footprint of networks.

As a future new shareholder of Play, iliad intends to launch a program to build around 5,000 sites in order
to meet the growing need for connectivity for individuals and businesses in Poland. As part of the program
agreements, the Group would undertake to build at least 1,500 of those sites in partnership with Cellnex,
representing approximately €400 million* over the next ten years.

In the same way as iliad’s takeover of Play, the partnership agreement is subject to the standard regulatory
conditions for this type of transaction (i.e. clearance from the relevant anti-trust authorities). The deal could
close during the first half of 2021 once this clearance has been obtained.

Press release dated 1 October 2020

**5G: iliad awarded 70 MHz of spectrum in the 3.4 - 3.8 GHz band**

The iliad Group is about to increase its spectrum portfolio, having been awarded 70 MHz of 3.4 - 3.8 GHz
frequencies, i.e. 23% of the spectrum available in the auction that ended today.

The Group has been awarded two blocks of 10 MHz for a total price of €252 million, to be paid over four
years. This is in addition to the 50 MHz block obtained by the Group after making the commitments
specified by ARCEP, in return for a payment of €350 million spread over 15 years.

This investment, made possible by the iliad Group’s solid financial position, will enable the Group to
maintain its growth in the French mobile market by launching soon 5G services for its 13.4 million
subscribers in the near future.

In addition, from 2021, the Group reminds that it will extend its spectrum in the 900 MHz frequency band
(+2.6 MHz symmetrical) and in the 2.1 GHz frequency band (+9.8 MHz symmetrical).

Press release dated 21 September 2020

**iliad announces its intention to acquire the Polish telecom operator, Play**

**• Launch of a public tender offer for Play – the leader in the Polish mobile market, with 15 million**
**subscribers – and purchase secured of a 40% controlling interest from Play’s two reference**
**shareholders.**

**• iliad and Play share a similar success story as the most recent entrants in the mobile market in three**
**major European countries. Together, they have 41 million subscribers in France, Poland and Italy.**
**iliad will be the best industrial partner to accompany Play’s growth in the mobile market and**
**optimize its entry into the fixed market.**

**• A business combination that is in the best interests of iliad’s shareholders: a unique opportunity to**
**enter a major market that is still growing while generating an accretive effect on the Group’s EPS**
**and FCF per share as from the very first year.**

**• The acquisition will be financed by debt and cash. The transaction is underpinned by iliad’s**
**financial strength and will reinforce its growth profile and cash-flow generation.**

**1. Launch of a public tender offer for Play and purchase secured of a 40% controlling interest from**
**Play’s two reference shareholders**

The Strategy Committee of HoldCo and the Board of Directors of iliad have approved the launch of a
public tender offer for all of the shares making up the capital of the Polish telecom operator, Play, for a cash
amount of PLN 39 per share (representing a total of c. €2.2 billion for 100% of the share capital and an
enterprise value of c. €3.5 billion). iliad has signed a binding agreement to purchase a 40% controlling
interest from Play’s two reference shareholders for the same unit price (i.e. PLN 39 per share), which will
give iliad the majority of seats on Play’s Board of Directors.

-----

At PLN 39 per share, the offer represents:

- A premium of 38.8% over the most recent closing share price

- A premium of 44.7% over the volume-weighted average share price for the last 7 days

- A premium of 32.9% over the volume-weighted average share price for the last 30 days

The deal remains subject to obtaining clearance from the relevant regulatory authorities and notification of
the planned acquisition will be submitted to the European Commission.

**Draft timeline for the public tender offer**

Filing of the offer: September 21, 2020

Start of subscription period: October 19, 2020

End of subscription period: November 17, 2020

Settlement – delivery date: November 25, 2020

**2. Play – a growing, innovative and profitable telco that is a perfect strategic fit with iliad**

- Like iliad, Play has seen exceptional growth over the past 15 years. It is the most recent entrant in the
Polish mobile telephony market, having entered in 2007, and today it has 15 million subscribers and a 29%
market share, making it the leading mobile telephony operator in Poland. Play currently employs some
2,800 people.

- Our two groups have a lot in common: we have both been game-changers in our markets and have
opened up mobile usages by proposing offerings accessible to everyone. Over the years, iliad and Play have
developed the same culture of growth and agility. Both groups now have powerful brands that are highly
respected in their countries and convey the values of innovation, simplicity and value for money.

- Play, a profitable player on a growth trajectory. Over the last 12 months, Play generated €1.6 billion in
revenues (up 2.0% year on year at constant exchange rates), €523 million in EBITDAaL (32.1% margin),
€359 million in OpFCF (22.0% margin) and €269 million in FCF (before its dividend payment).

- iliad – an industrial partner to help drive Play’s growth. iliad’s expertise and experience will help Play
grow in the mobile market and facilitate its entry into the fixed market. iliad will also help accelerate the
digital distribution of Play’s offerings. All of these developments will be carried out drawing on the skills of
Play’s management teams.

**3. A business combination that is in the best interests of both iliad’s and Play’s shareholders**

**_For iliad’s shareholders_**

- For iliad, the acquisition represents a unique opportunity for growth and for entering the Polish telecom
market. With 38 million inhabitants, Poland is central Europe’s largest market. It is the sixth-largest
economy in the European Union and has seen steady growth for 28 years; per capita GDP has risen 6% on
average per year over the last twenty years.

- Through this acquisition, iliad will cement its position as a pan-European telecom player, operating in
three of Europe’s largest telecom markets: France, Italy, and now Poland. All three of these countries are in
distinct stages of expansion and have clear growth prospects.

- The acquisition will be accretive for iliad’s shareholders in terms of both EPS and FCF per share as from
the very first year.

-----

**_For Play’s shareholders_**

- The tender offer will give Play’s shareholders the opportunity of receiving PLN 39 per share, representing
a 38.8% premium over Play’s most recent closing share price and a 32.9% premium over the volumeweighted average share price for the last thirty days. This premium is notably justified by Play’s intrinsic
quality and the value of its mobile passive infrastructure.

- The offer gives Play enterprise value multiples (on a last-twelve-months basis) of 6.8x EBITDAaL and
9.9x OpFCF before taking into account the synergies generated by integrating Play into the iliad Group.

**4. iliad and Play – two groups with solid financials**

This growth transaction is underpinned by the iliad Group’s financial strength. iliad’s leverage ratio would
increase from 2.2x at end-June 2020 to 3.2.x on a pro forma basis, but the Group intends to gradually
deleverage following the acquisition. In addition, iliad will continue the process launched by Play’s existing
management and shareholders of spinning off and selling its passive infrastructure.

iliad’s projected acquisition of Play will be financed by debt and available cash, with acquisition financing
already secured with a pool of international banks.

In view of Play’s profitability and the financing conditions underlying the acquisition, the deal will be
accretive for iliad’s EPS and FCF per share as from the first year. It will therefore enable iliad to maintain
its financial and strategic flexibility, a reasonable leverage ratio and its dividend policy.

**Thomas Reynaud, iliad’s Chief Executive Officer, said: “This excellent alliance constitutes a new**
growth driver for the iliad Group and gives it access to one of Europe’s high-potential telecom markets.
Pooling the expertise of Play’s and iliad’s teams will reinforce the iliad Group’s fundamentals through a
combination of growth and innovation. The transaction will make iliad the sixth-largest telecom operator in
Europe. Fully committed to implementing its Odyssey 2024 Plan, iliad is a solid group that is pursuing its
expansion with confidence.”

**Jean-Marc Harion, the Chairman of Play’s Management Board, said: “This alliance with the iliad**
Group marks an important chapter in Play’s history, as it will accelerate its business development in fixed
services. Play and iliad share the same values and overall corporate vision. Our Board of Directors has
unanimously approved the deal, firmly convinced of its strategic fit and value creation potential for Play’s
shareholders.”
