The maximum aggregate nominal amount of all Notes from time to time outstanding will not exceed

Dealers and the Issue Dealers are herein together referred to as the "Dealers" and references to a
"Dealer" are to a Programme Dealer or, as the case may be, an Issue Dealer. References to the "relevant
**Dealer" are references to the Dealer or Dealers with whom the Issuer has agreed or proposes to agree**
the terms of an issue of Notes under the Programme.

An investment in Notes issued under the Programme involves certain risks. For a discussion of these
risks see "Risk Factors" below.

This Offering Circular has been approved as a base prospectus by the Central Bank as competent
authority under the Prospectus Regulation. The Central Bank only approves this Offering Circular as
meeting the standards of completeness, comprehensibility and consistency imposed by the Prospectus
Regulation. Approval by the Central Bank should not be considered as an endorsement of the Issuer or
of the quality of the Notes. Investors should make their own assessment as to the suitability of investing
in the Notes.

Such approval relates only to Notes which are to be admitted to trading on the regulated market of the
Irish Stock Exchange plc (the "Euronext Dublin Regulated Market"), trading as Euronext Dublin
("Euronext Dublin") or on another regulated market for the purposes of Directive 2014/65/EU (as
amended, "MiFID II") and/or that are to be offered to the public in any member state of the EEA
(which, until the end of the transition period under the UK-EU Withdrawal Agreement (as defined
below), for these purposes, shall include the United Kingdom) in circumstances that require the
publication of a prospectus.

Application has been made to Euronext Dublin for Notes issued under the Programme to be admitted
to its Official List (the "Official List") and trading on the Euronext Dublin Regulated Market. The
Issuer may also issue unlisted Notes and/or Notes not admitted to trading on any market or admitted to
trading on any other market which is not a regulated market for the purposes of MiFID II.

This Offering Circular (as supplemented as at the relevant time, if applicable) is valid for 12 months
from its date in relation to Notes which are to be admitted to trading on a regulated market in the
European Economic Area and/or offered to the public in the EEA other than in circumstances where an
exemption is available under Article 1(4) and/or 3(2) of the Prospectus Regulation. Until the end of the
transition period under the UK-EU Withdrawal Agreement, for these purposes, references to the EEA
shall include the United Kingdom. The obligation to supplement this Offering Circular in the event of
a significant new factor, material mistake or material inaccuracy does not apply when this Offering
Circular is no longer valid.

giving information with regard to the issue of Notes having a maturity of less than 365 days as
commercial paper under the Programme during the period of 12 months after the date hereof.

**REGULATION TO PUBLISH A PROSPECTUS**

**Restrictions on Public Offers of Notes in relevant Member States of the EEA and the United**
**Kingdom where there is no exemption from the obligation under the Prospectus Regulation to**
**publish a prospectus**

Certain Tranches of Notes with a denomination of less than EUR 100,000 (or its equivalent in any other
currency) may be offered in circumstances where there is no exemption from the obligation under the
Prospectus Regulation to publish a prospectus. Any such offer is referred to as a "Public Offer". This
Offering Circular has been prepared on a basis that permits Public Offers of Notes in each State in
relation to which the Issuer has given its consent (from amongst Member States and the United
Kingdom), as specified in the applicable Final Terms (each specified State a "Public Offer
**Jurisdiction" and together the "Public Offer Jurisdictions"). Any person making or intending to make**
a Public Offer of Notes on the basis of this Offering Circular must do so only with the Issuer's consent
to the use of this Offering Circular as provided under "Consent given in accordance with Article 5(1)
_of the Prospectus Regulation" below and provided such person complies with the conditions attached_
to that consent.

Save as provided above, the Issuer and the Dealers have not authorised, nor do they authorise, the
making of any Public Offer of Notes in circumstances in which an obligation arises for the Issuer or
any Dealer to publish or supplement a prospectus for such offer.

**Consent given in accordance with Article 5(1) of the Prospectus Regulation**

In the context of a Public Offer of such Notes, the Issuer accepts responsibility, in each of the Public
Offer Jurisdictions, for the content of this Offering Circular in relation to any person (an "Investor" or
collectively the "Investors") who purchases any Notes in a Public Offer made by a Dealer or an
Authorised Offeror (as defined below), where that offer is made during the Offer Period specified in
the applicable Final Terms and provided that the conditions attached to that giving of consent for the
use of this Offering Circular are complied with. The consent and conditions attached to it are set out
under "Consent" and "Common Conditions to Consent" below.

Neither the Issuer nor any Dealer makes any representation as to the compliance by an Authorised
Offeror with any applicable conduct of business rules or other applicable regulatory or securities law

requirements in relation to any Public Offer and neither the Issuer nor any Dealer has any responsibility
or liability for the actions of that Authorised Offeror.

**Except in the circumstances set out in the following paragraphs, the Issuer has not authorised the**
**making of any Public Offer by any offeror and the Issuer has not consented to the use of this**
**Offering Circular by any other person in connection with any Public Offer of Notes. Any Public**
**Offer made without the consent of the Issuer is unauthorised and the Issuer and, for the avoidance**
**of doubt, the Dealers do not accept any responsibility or liability in relation to such offer or for**
**the actions of the persons making any such unauthorised offer.**

If, in the context of a Public Offer, an Investor is offered Notes by a person which is not an Authorised
Offeror, the Investor should check with that person whether anyone is responsible for this Offering
Circular for the purposes of the Public Offer and, if so, who that person is. If the Investor is in any doubt
about whether it can rely on this Offering Circular and/or who is responsible for its contents it should
take legal advice.

who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a
customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor
as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key information document required by
Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 (as amended, the "PRIIPs Regulation") for offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or in the UK (as the case may
be) has been or will be prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them
available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the UK (as the case may be) may be unlawful under the
PRIIPs Regulation.

_Under the terms of the ratified EU-UK article 50 withdrawal agreement (the "UK-EU Withdrawal_
**_Agreement"), a transition period has now commenced which will last until 31 December 2020. During_**
_this period, most EU rules and regulations will continue to apply to and in the UK and negotiations in_
_relation to a free trade agreement will be ongoing. Under the UK-EU Withdrawal Agreement, the_
_transition period may, before 1 July 2020, be extended once by up to two years._

**MIFID II PRODUCT GOVERNANCE / TARGET MARKET - The Final Terms in respect of any**
Notes will include a legend entitled "MiFID II product governance" which will outline the target market
assessment in respect of the Notes and which channels for distribution of the Notes are appropriate.
Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a "distributor") should take
into consideration the target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting
or refining the target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

A determination will be made in relation to each issue about whether, for the purpose of the Product
Governance rules under Commission Delegated Directive 2017/593 (the "MiFID Product
**Governance Rules"), any Dealer subscribing for any Notes is a manufacturer in respect of such Notes,**
but otherwise neither UBS Europe SE as arranger (the "Arranger") nor the Dealers nor any of their
respective affiliates will be a manufacturer for the purpose of the MIFID Product Governance Rules.

jurisdiction. The distribution of this Offering Circular and the offer or sale of Notes may be restricted
by law in certain jurisdictions. Neither the Issuer nor the Dealers represent that this Offering Circular

applicable registration or other requirements in any such jurisdiction, or pursuant to an exemption
available thereunder, or assume any responsibility for facilitating any such distribution or offering. In
particular, unless specifically indicated to the contrary in the applicable Final Terms, no action has been
taken by the Issuer or the Dealers which is intended to permit a public offering of any Notes or
distribution of this Offering Circular in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required.
Accordingly, no Notes may be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Circular
nor any advertisement or other offering material may be distributed or published in any jurisdiction,
except under circumstances that will result in compliance with any applicable laws and regulations.
Each Dealer has represented or, as the case may be, will be required to represent that all offers and sales
by it will be made on the terms indicated above. Persons into whose possession this Offering Circular
or any Notes may come must inform themselves about, and observe, any such restrictions on the

restrictions on the distribution of this Offering Circular and the offer or sale of Notes in the United
States, the United Kingdom, the EEA (including Portugal, the Republic of Italy and France) and Japan,
see "Subscription and Sale and Transfer Restrictions" below.

The Notes may not be a suitable investment for all prospective Investors. Each potential Investor in the
Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular,
each potential Investor may wish to consider, either on its own or with the help of its financial and other
professional advisers, whether it:

(a) has sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Notes, the
merits and risks of investing in the Notes and the information contained or incorporated by
reference in this Offering Circular or any applicable supplement;

(b) has access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its
particular financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact the Notes will have on
its overall investment portfolio;

(c) has sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the
Notes, including Notes where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from
the potential Investor's currency;

(d) understands thoroughly the terms of the Notes and is familiar with the behaviour of financial
markets; and

(e) is able to evaluate possible scenarios for economic, interest rate and other factors that may
affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks.

Legal investment considerations may restrict certain investments. The investment activities of certain
Investors are subject to investment laws and regulations, or review or regulation by certain authorities.
Each potential Investor should consult its legal advisers to determine whether and to what extent (i)
Notes are legal investments for it, (ii) Notes can be used as collateral for various types of borrowing
and (iii) other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of any Notes. Financial institutions should

under any applicable risk-based capital or similar rules.

exceptions, Notes may not be offered, sold or delivered within the United States or to, or for the account
or benefit of, U.S. persons, as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act, unless an exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act is available and in accordance with all
applicable securities law of any state of the United States and any other jurisdiction (see "Subscription
_and Sale and Transfer Restrictions" below)._

**Manager(s)") (or persons acting on behalf of any Stabilisation Manager(s)) may over-allot Notes or**
effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the Notes at a level higher than that
which might otherwise prevail. However, stabilisation may not necessarily occur. Any stabilisation

"should" and any similar expressions generally identify forward looking statements. These forward
looking statements are contained in the sections entitled "Risk Factors" and "Description of the Business

which the Issuer has otherwise identified in this Offering Circular, or if any of the Issuer's underlying
assumptions prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, the Issuer's actual results of operation may vary from
those expected, estimated or predicted.

The risks and uncertainties referred to above include:

- the Issuer's ability to achieve and manage the growth of its business;

- the performance of the markets in Portugal and the wider region in which the Issuer operates;

- the Issuer's ability to realise the benefits it expects from existing and future projects and
investments it is undertaking or plans to or may undertake;

- the Issuer's ability to obtain external financing or maintain sufficient capital to fund its existing
and future investments and projects;

- changes in political, social, legal or economic conditions in the markets in which the Issuer and
its customers operate; and

- actions taken by the Issuer's joint venture partners that may not be in accordance with its
policies and objectives.

Any forward looking statements contained in this Offering Circular speak only as at the date of this
Offering Circular. Without prejudice to the Issuer's obligations under applicable laws and regulations
in relation to disclosure and ongoing information, the Issuer expressly disclaims any obligation or
undertaking to disseminate after the date of this Offering Circular any updates or revisions to any
forward looking statements contained in it to reflect any change in expectations or any change in events,
conditions or circumstances on which any such forward looking statement is based.

**Risk Factors:** There are certain factors that may affect the Issuer's ability to
fulfil its obligations under the Notes issued under the
Programme, including, _inter alia, those set out under Risk_
_Factors below. In addition, there are risk factors which are_
material for the purpose of assessing the other risks associated
with Notes issued under the Programme. These are also set out
in detail under _Risk Factors_ below and include, inter alia, the
dynamics of the legal and regulatory requirements and the risks
related to the structure of a particular issue of Notes.

**Distribution:** Notes may be distributed by way of private placement or public

organisation.

**Use of Proceeds:** Proceeds from the issue of Notes will be used by the Issuer for
its general corporate purposes or as otherwise set out in the
applicable Final Terms.

**Status and Subordination:** The Issuer may issue Senior Notes, Senior Non-Preferred Notes
or the Subordinated Notes under the Programme.

Senior Notes constitute direct, unconditional, unsubordinated
and (subject to certain provisions of negative pledge to the extent
specified as applicable to such Senior Notes in the applicable
Final Terms) unsecured obligations of the Issuer and will rank
_pari passu among themselves and (save for certain obligations_
required to be preferred by law) equally with all other unsecured
and unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer which do not qualify
as Statutory Senior Non-Preferred Obligations, from time to time
outstanding.

Senior Non-Preferred Notes constitute direct, unsubordinated
and unsecured obligations of the Issuer and (save for certain
obligations required to be preferred by law) will rank (i) _pari_
_passu among themselves and with all other obligations of the_
Issuer qualifying as Statutory Senior Non-Preferred Obligations,
(ii) in the event of the bankruptcy of the Issuer, junior to any
unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer which do
not qualify as Statutory Senior Non-Preferred Obligations, and
(iii) senior to any Junior Obligations.

Payments in respect of any Subordinated Notes constitute direct,
unconditional and unsecured obligations of the Issuer, save that
the claims of the holders of the Notes in respect of payments
pursuant thereto will, in the event of the winding-up of the Issuer
(to the extent permitted by Portuguese Law), be wholly
subordinated to the claims of all Senior Creditors of the Issuer.


**Terms and Conditions of the**
**Notes:**


Final Terms will be prepared in respect of each Tranche of Notes,
completing the Terms and Conditions of the Notes set out in
_Terms and Conditions of the Notes._


**Clearing System:** Interbolsa. See Clearing and Settlement. Without prejudice to
the foregoing, investors will be able to hold an interest in the

Clearstream Banking S.A. ("Clearstream, Luxembourg"), who
are clients of an Interbolsa Participant for these purposes.

**Form of the Notes:** The Notes will be in book-entry form (forma escritural) and are
_nominativas (i.e. Interbolsa, at the Issuer's request, can ask the_
Interbolsa Participants information regarding the identity of the
holders of Notes and transmit such information to the Issuer) and

20

and the applicable CMVM regulations. No physical document
of title will be issued in respect of the Notes. See Clearing and
_Settlement._

**Transfer of Notes:** The Notes may be transferred in accordance with the provisions
of Interbolsa. The transferability of the Notes is not restricted.

**Maturities:** The Notes will have such maturities as may be agreed between
the Issuer and the relevant Dealer(s) and as set out in the

the relevant central bank (or equivalent body) or any laws or
regulations applicable to the Issuer or the relevant Specified
Currency.

**Issue Price:** The Notes may be issued on a fully-paid basis and at an issue
price which is at par or at a discount to, or premium over, par, as
specified in the applicable Final Terms.

**Cross Default:** Senior Notes main contain a cross default provision if so
specified in the applicable Final Terms and as further described
below and in Condition 9(a) (Event of Default relating to certain
_Senior Notes)._

**Events of Default:** If the Notes are specified as Senior Notes in the applicable Final
Terms and Condition 9(a) (Events of Default relating to certain
_Senior Notes) is specified as being "Applicable", the terms of_
such Senior Notes will contain, amongst others, the following
events of default:

(a) default in payment of any principal or interest due in
respect of the Notes, continuing for a specified period of
time;

(b) non-performance or non-observance by the Issuer of any
of its other obligations (i.e. under the conditions of the
Notes), in certain cases continuing for a specified period
of time;

(c) acceleration by reason of default of the repayment of any
indebtedness or default in any payment of any
indebtedness or in the honouring of any guarantee or
indemnity in respect of any indebtedness by the Issuer,
in any case so long as any such indebtedness exceeds the
specified threshold; and

(d) events relating to the winding-up or dissolution of the
Issuer.

The terms of the Subordinated Notes, the Senior Non-Preferred
Notes and (where the Notes are specified as Senior Notes in the

21


-----

applicable Final Terms and Condition 9(b) (Events of Default
_and Enforcement relating to Subordinated Notes, Senior Non-_
_Preferred Notes and certain Senior Notes) is specified as being_
"Applicable") certain of the Senior Notes will contain the
following events of default:

(a) failure by the Issuer to make payments in respect of the
Notes, continuing for a specified period of time, giving
rise to the right of Noteholders to institute proceedings
for the winding-up of the Issuer; and

(b) events relating to the winding-up or dissolution of the
Issuer.

No acceleration may occur until a winding-up or dissolution of
the Issuer.

**Negative Pledge:** In the case of Senior Notes where the applicable Final Terms
specify that Condition 3 ("Negative Pledge") is "Applicable", the
terms of such Senior Notes will contain a negative pledge
provision, as further described in such Condition.

The terms of the Subordinated Notes, the Senior Non-Preferred
Notes and, where the applicable Final Terms specify that
Condition 3 ("Negative Pledge") is "Not Applicable", the Senior
Notes will not contain a negative pledge provision.

**Fixed Rate Notes:** Fixed interest will be payable on such date or dates as may be
agreed between the Issuer and the relevant Dealer(s) and on
redemption and will be calculated on the basis of such Day Count
Fraction as may be agreed between the Issuer and the relevant
Dealer(s) (as set out in the applicable Final Terms).

**Reset Rate Notes:** Reset Rate Notes will initially bear interest at the Initial Rate of
Interest until (but excluding) the First Reset Date. On the First
Reset Date, the Second Reset Date (if applicable) and each
Subsequent Reset Date (if any) thereafter, the interest rate will be
reset to the sum of the applicable Mid-Swap Rate and the Reset
Margin as determined by the Calculation Agent on the relevant
Reset Determination Date (each such interest rate, a
"Subsequent Reset Rate"), all as further described in Condition
4(b).

**Floating Rate Notes:** Floating Rate Notes will bear interest determined separately for
each Series as follows:

                 - on the same basis as the floating rate under a notional
interest rate swap transaction in the relevant Specified
Currency governed by an agreement incorporating the
2006 ISDA Definitions (as published by the

International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc.
("ISDA") and as amended and updated as at the Issue

22


-----

Date of the first Tranche of Notes of the relevant Series);
or

                 - on the basis of a reference rate appearing on the agreed
screen page of a commercial quotation service.

The margin (if any) relating to such floating rate will be agreed
between the Issuer and the relevant Dealer(s) for each Series of
Floating Rate Notes. Interest periods will be specified in the
applicable Final Terms.

In the event a Benchmark Event occurs (a) a Successor Rate or,
failing which, an Alternative Reference Rate, and (b) in either
case, an Adjustment Spread may be used for the purposes of
determining the Rate of Interest.

**Zero Coupon Notes:** Zero Coupon Notes may be offered and sold at a discount to their
nominal amount unless otherwise specified in the applicable
Final Terms.

**Redemption:** The terms under which Notes may be redeemed (including the
maturity date and the price at which they will be redeemed on the
maturity date as well as any provisions relating to early
redemption) will be agreed between the Issuer and the relevant
Dealer at the time of issue of the relevant Notes.

The Issuer has the right to redeem Notes (i) upon certain taxation
events, (ii) in the case of Subordinated Notes, Senior NonPreferred Notes and certain Senior Notes upon a change in
regulatory classification of the Notes and (iii) if so specified in
the applicable Final Terms, at its option.

**Substitution and Variation:** If, in the case of any Series of Subordinated Notes, Condition
6(m) ("Substitution and Variation of Subordinated Notes") is
specified as being "Applicable" in the relevant Final Terms and
a capital event or tax event giving rise to a right by the Issuer to
call the Notes has occurred and is continuing, or in order to
ensure the effectiveness and enforceability of Condition 16(d),
then the Issuer may, subject to certain conditions, substitute all
(but not some only) of such Series of Subordinated Notes for, or
vary the terms of such Series of Subordinated Notes (including
changing the governing law of Condition 16(d) from English law
to Portuguese law or any other European law that, after
consultation with the regulator, the Issuer considers allows the
Subordinated Notes to be tier 2 compliant notes) so that the Notes
remain or become tier 2 compliant notes.

If in the case of Senior Notes or Senior Non-Preferred Notes,
Condition 6(n) ("Substitution and Variation of Senior Non_Preferred Notes and Senior Notes") is specified as being_
"Applicable" in the relevant Final Terms, and an MREL
disqualification event or tax event giving rise to a right by the
Issuer to call the Notes has occurred or in order to ensure the

23


-----

effectiveness and enforceability of Condition 16(d), then the
Issuer may, subject to certain conditions, substitute all (but not
some only) of such Series of Notes for, or vary the terms of such
Series of Notes (including changing the governing law of
Condition 16(d) from English law to Portuguese law or any other
European law that, after consultation with the regulator, the
Issuer considers allows the Notes to be MREL compliant notes)
so that the Notes remain or become MREL compliant notes.

**Denomination of Notes:** The Notes will be issued in such denominations as may be agreed
between the Issuer and the relevant Dealer save that the minimum
denomination of each Note will be such amount as may be
allowed or required from time to time by the relevant central bank
(or equivalent body) or any laws or regulations applicable to the
relevant Specified Currency and save that the minimum
denomination of each Note will be EUR 1,000 (or, if the Notes
are denominated in a currency other than euro, the equivalent
amount in such currency).

Each Series will have Notes of one denomination only.

**Taxation of the Notes:** All payments in respect of the Notes will be made without
deduction for or on account of any withholding taxes imposed by
Portugal unless such deduction or withholding is required by law.
In the event that any such deduction is made, the Issuer will, save
in certain limited circumstances, be required to pay additional
amounts to cover the amounts so deducted. In the case of
Subordinated Notes and, where Condition 7(b) is specified as
"Applicable" in the applicable Final Terms, Senior Notes and
Senior Non-Preferred Notes, the requirement of the Issuer to pay
additional amounts will be limited to payments of interest.

**Governing Law:** English law, except that in relation to the status of Subordinated
Notes and Senior Non-Preferred Notes and the form and transfer
of Notes, the creation of security over Notes and the Interbolsa
procedures for the exercise of rights under Notes will be
governed by Portuguese law.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a degree of risk. Prospective investors should carefully consider_
_the risks set forth below and the other information contained in this Offering Circular prior to making_
_any investment decision with respect to the Notes. The risks described below could have a material_
_adverse effect on BCP's business, financial condition and results of operations or the value of the Notes._
_Additional risks and uncertainties, including those of which the BCP Group's management is not_
_currently aware or deems immaterial, may also potentially have an adverse effect on the BCP Group's_
_business, results of operations, financial condition or future prospects or may result in other events that_
_could cause investors to lose all or part of their investment._

**INTRODUCTION**

The risk factors described below are those that the Issuer believes are material and specific to the Issuer
and that may affect the Issuer's ability to fulfil each of its obligations under the Notes. The risk factors
have been organised into the following categories:

1. Risks relating to the Issuer

1.1 Risks relating to the Economic and Financial Environment

1.2 Legal and Regulatory Risks

1.3 Risks relating to Acquisitions

1.4 Risks relating to the Bank's Business

2. Risks relating to Notes issued under the Programme

2.1 Risks relating to the Structure of a particular issue of Notes

2.2 Risks relating to Notes generally

2.3 Risks relating to the Market generally

Within each category, the most material risks, in the assessment of the Issuer, are set out first. The Issuer
has assessed the relative materiality of the risk factors based on the probability of their occurrence and
the expected magnitude of their negative impact. The order of the categories does not imply that any
category of risk is more material than any other category.

**1.** **RISKS RELATING TO THE ISSUER**

**1.1** **Risks relating to the Economic and Financial Environment**

**Portuguese economy**

The COVID-19 pandemic is inflicting high and rising human costs worldwide, and the necessary
protection measures are severely impacting economic activity, as protecting lives and allowing health
care systems to cope have required isolation, lockdowns, and widespread closures to slow the spread of
the virus. As a result, the global economy is projected to contract sharply by -3% in 2020 according to
the International Monetary Fund ("IMF").

Against this background the outlook for the Portuguese economy has undergone a sudden and marked
deterioration. In 2020, the IMF foresees that the Portuguese economy will drop by 8% as a result of

25


-----

the economic impact of the pandemic. In 2021, the Portuguese economy should return to growth rates
around 5%, assuming that economic policies work out as planned at the global level, meaning that the
world economy starts recovering once the acute phase of the pandemic is passed, which will favour the
recovery of the Portuguese economy.

On the financial front, the forceful intervention of the European Central Bank (the "ECB") has been so
far crucial to preclude any meaningful deterioration in risk-aversion thereby contributing to keep
financial costs and yields at relatively low levels. When the economy returns to normality, the risk
premia in the long-term debt securities of domestic issuers is likely to start to narrow gradually.

_Global health crisis_

The uncertainty around the pandemic itself is considered to remain elevated until a vaccine and/or
therapies to counter the disease are in place. In this context, despite the Portuguese authorities' success
in bringing down the spread of the disease in the domestic community, Portugal remains vulnerable to
renewed infection outbreaks. If the pandemic proves more persistent, the effects on the economic
activity and financial markets could turn out to be stronger and longer lasting, testing the limits of
central banks to backstop the financial system and further raising the fiscal burden of the shock.

The uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the pandemic crisis in Portugal are affecting, and
will continue to affect, the behaviour and financial position of the Bank's customers and, therefore, the
supply and demand of the products and services offered by the Bank and its cost of risk.

_Dramatic tightening in global financial market conditions_

Despite the broad-based monetary stimulus and the available liquidity facilities there are risks of
significant additional tightening of financial conditions, which could further dampen economic activity
in the near term, adding to the direct macroeconomic fallout of the health crisis. The possibility of
aggravation or persistence of adverse financing conditions could further weigh on economic conditions,
hindering the evolution of banking business and, consequently, its profitability.

_Risks of a protracted recession of the Portuguese economy and/or a slow recovery_

The IMF projects a partial recovery of Portuguese economy in 2021, with the level of GDP remaining
below the pre-virus trend. However, if the pandemic and containment measures last longer, the
economy could remain in recession in 2021 and/or recover at a slower pace.

Any limitation to the growth of the Portuguese economy would predictably imply a fall of demand for
credit, the cost of funding could rise and the credit quality of the loans' portfolio and other segments of
the asset side of the Bank's balance sheet would deteriorate.

_The Portuguese economy presents specific vulnerabilities to the economic shock associated to the_
_pandemic crisis_

Despite the significant structural changes implemented since 2011, the budget surplus recorded in 2019,
the reduction of public and private debt and a growth trend above the potential GDP in the last years,
the Portuguese economy presents specific vulnerabilities to the current shock:

i) The importance of the tourism sector for economic activity entails a high exposure to the
expected reduction in global demand for this type of service, which will be very substantial.

ii) The Portuguese corporate sector presents currently a still relatively fragile financial situation.

26


-----

iii) The high percentage of households close to or below the poverty line in Portugal means that
there is only a small margin to absorb the expected shock to income. In a context of a still
elevated private debt, any deterioration in households' and companies' financial condition could
lead to a fall in the demand for credit, and to a deterioration of the credit quality of the loans'
portfolio and other segments of the asset side of the Bank's balance sheet.

iv) The high level of Portuguese government debt could lead to relevant limitations on the ability
of the Portuguese government to stimulate growth in response to a downturn as severe as the
one likely to follow the current economic shock. The high public-sector indebtedness is
therefore an important factor of vulnerability, as any change in investors' perception of
Portuguese debt sustainability may contribute to raise the Bank's cost of funding and to weaken
the performance of the financial assets seating on the Bank's portfolio – in particular, the
Portuguese public debt securities.

_Domestic political risks_

The 2019 parliamentary elections in Portugal have not conferred an absolute majority to the party that
formed the government. Against the backdrop of current health and economic crisis any risks of
political instability could undermine confidence and hamper the political actions needed to tackle both
crises, and thereby impact adversely on economic activity and the Portuguese Republic's credit profile.
Any of these could have a material adverse effect on the Bank's business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

_Risks related to European Union_

The pandemic crisis underlines the need to strengthen coordination and cooperation at the European
level, notably in economic terms. In this context, relevant divergences between the European Union
(EU) Member States in adopting solidarity measures and shared economic policy actions to stimulate
the economic recovery could rise fears regarding the integrity of the EU.

Any change in EU or in European Monetary Union may affect the Portuguese sovereign credit profile,
which may lead to concerns relating to the capacity of the Portuguese Republic to meet its funding
needs. Any deterioration could have a direct impact on the value of the Bank's portfolio of public debt.
Any permanent reduction of the value of public debt would be reflected in the Bank's equity position.

_Monetary policy risks_

The Bank is exposed to risks associated with any disruption to the ECB's monetary and liquidity
facilities introduced to avoid systemic stress in the financial system and to lift confidence and to prevent
an even deeper contraction of economic activity. Any sudden change in monetary policy could have a
substantial downward impact on the valuation of the Portuguese government's debt directly, or
indirectly via contagion through the loss in value of the public debt securities of other EMU countries,
which would in turn hurt the Bank directly through the investment book and indirectly by affecting the
price and availability of the Bank's funding in the market and also by potentially lowering the demand
for loans from households and corporations. In addition, any further substantial decline of ECB's
reference interest rates and/or the maintenance of negative interest rates for a protracted period would
affect negatively the Bank's ability to generate net interest margin.

_Risks to the real estate market_

The current economic shock increases the risk of a significant devaluation of Portuguese real estate
prices, including, without limitation, through a fall of demand by non-residents and the drop of tourism
demand, which may lead to an increase in impairment losses in the assets held directly by the Bank as

27


-----

well as in the participating units of the restructuring funds held by the Bank, and to increased exposure
in counterparty risk for loans guaranteed by real estate collateral and in pension fund assets retained by
the Bank.

_External-trade channel risk_

The expected deterioration of economic activity in the main trading partners of Portugal (as at December
2019 and according to Portugal's National Statistics Institute, in decreasing order: Spain, France,
Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Angola and
Norway), along with global supply disruptions, the risk of protectionist policies and the possible
behavioural changes in Portuguese trading partners could impact negatively the performance of the
Portuguese economy and lead to economic and financial difficulties, which could have a material
adverse effect on the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations or its prospects.

_Geopolitical risks_

The pandemic and the economic crisis could intensify geopolitical risks worldwide. The risks may be
derived, among other adverse factors, from the escalation of protectionism and trade wars among the
major world economic blocs and/or the intensification of actual or potential military conflicts. Any of
these could have a material adverse effect on the Bank's business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

_Risks related to Brexit_

The United Kingdom formally left the EU on 31 January 2020, but the terms of the new relationship
are still undefined and are expected to be negotiated until the end of December 2020. The turmoil caused
by the pandemic could lead to protracted negotiations therefore contributing to an increased uncertainty
around the new relationship of the United Kingdom with the EU countries, notably regarding a new
free trade agreement. As the United Kingdom is one of the main Portuguese trading partners (both in
terms of goods and services), any uncertainty relating to such future trade conditions could impact
negatively the performance of the Portuguese exports, which could have an adverse effect on the Bank's
business.

**_Other economies where the Bank operates_**

_Poland_

- Risks related to the economic conditions

The government measures at limiting the spread of epidemic are likely to lead to a significant drop of
economic activity in Poland. Consequently, a deterioration of the labour market and a fall of disposable
income for households can be expected. Along with the drop of domestic demand the external demand
should also plummet, negatively impacting exports and manufacturing activities.

The deterioration of economic conditions in Poland and the instability in financial markets may
constrain economic activity and cause greater volatility of the Polish zloty ("PLN") exchange rate and,
consequently, affect the Bank's results directly through financial operations and indirectly through
repercussions on the clients' financial situation.

- Domestic political risks

Political and legal tensions with the European Union, particularly considering that the European
Commission decided on 10 October 2019 to refer Poland to the Court of Justice of the EU regarding
the new disciplinary regime for Polish judges, could adversely affect political and social stability in

28


-----

Poland and consequently its economic and financial situation, which would negatively impact Bank's
activity and results.

- Risks related to banking system policy

Risks related to the implementation of economic policy decisions, namely on the tax front, targeting the
banking system by Polish authorities, could negatively affect investors' confidence and the economic
activity and, consequently, negatively impact the profitability of the Polish banking sector.

_Mozambique_

- Commodity prices risks

Mozambique is an important exporter of aluminium and coal and has also important projects in progress
related to natural gas. As weaker global demand drives down commodity prices, the Mozambican
economy could face significant pressure on its public finances, on real economic activity and on its
exchange rate, which could negatively impact the reform efforts that Mozambican authorities have been
implementing in the last years in order to address the sovereign debt crisis. Any deterioration of
economic and financial conditions could result in additional negotiations with the IMF and international
creditors. In such circumstances, the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects could be negatively affected.

- Domestic political risks

i) Any deterioration of the economic and financial situation may contribute to the rise of
political tensions (Frelimo and Renamo, the two main political parties in Mozambique,
have been holding start-stop talks aimed at ending a military conflict that was resumed
in 2013), which could negatively affect the Bank's business, financial condition, results
of operations and prospects.

ii) The natural gas industry in Mozambique has been crucial to both the expansion of
economic growth and social change. In this context, if the scale and frequency of
attacks in gas-rich Cabo Delgado Province intensifies it could hinder the natural gas
industry activity and thereby the expansion of economic activity and social progress.
Any of these factors could negatively affect the Bank's business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects.

_Angola_

- Commodity prices risks

Given the reliance of Angolan economy on oil exports, the recent implosion of crude prices, if sustained,
could create significant pressure on Angola's public finances, on the real economic activity and on its
exchange rate, which could negatively impact the reform efforts that Angolan authorities have been
implementing in the last years in order to address economic and structural imbalances. In such
circumstances, the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be
negatively affected.

**1.2** **Legal and Regulatory Risks**

**_The Bank is subject to complex regulation that could increase regulatory and capital requirements._**

The Bank conducts its business in accordance with applicable regulations and is subject to related
regulatory risks, including the effects of amendments to laws, regulations and policies applicable in

29


-----

Portugal and in other countries where the Bank operates. Portuguese and international regulatory
entities, including the European Central Bank ("ECB"), Banco de Portugal and the European Banking
Authority ("EBA"), have implemented significant changes to the Bank's regulatory framework,
particularly in relation to capital and liquidity adequacy and the scope of the Bank's operations. These
changes are continuously being updated and revised, adjusting to past experience or to new business
trends and other changes may be implemented in the future. Consequently, the Bank could face more
intense regulation that could adversely and significantly impact the results of its operations.

Most recently, in May 2019, the Council adopted a comprehensive legislative package (the "banking
**package") implementing material elements of the Basel III framework ("Basel III") at the European**
level by way of amendments to Regulation No. 575/2013/EU of the European Parliament and of the
Council, of 26 June 2013, as amended (the "Capital Requirements Regulation" or "CRR") and Directive
2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 26 June 2013, as amended (the "Capital
**Requirements Directive" or "CRD IV"), and on the framework for the recovery and resolution of**
banks in difficulty, notably Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 15
May 2014, as amended (the "Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive" or "BRRD") and Regulation
No. 806/2014/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 15 July 2014 (the "SRM
**Regulation"). Some of these changes have already been enacted while others will enter into force in**
the coming years together with changes stemming from the adoption of the Basel III reforms, some of
which are still being assessed by the European Commission.

Changes to risk weighted assets ("RWA") could also come from adjustments on internal models, such
as those associated with better calibration or further to supervisory requirements.

The implementation of new regulations may increase capital requirements and could result in additional
preparatory work, disclosure needs, restrictions on certain types of transactions, limitations to the Bank's
strategy, the need to take strategic actions, which may include raising additional capital, and/or
limitations to, or modification of, the Bank's earnings derived from margin, fees, capital gains or other
sources of income. Any of the above may reduce the business volume and the yield of the Bank's
investments, assets or holdings, which could have a material adverse effect on the Bank's business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects. For further details on banking regulation please
see "Description of the Business of the Group – Recent developments on the banking regulation".

Furthermore, a global systemically important institution ("G-SII") could face additional requirements.
Although it is currently not anticipated that Portuguese banks may be classified as G-SIIs, there is no
assurance that this will not change in the future. The Bank is currently classified as an "other
systemically important institution" ("O-SII"), and as such it is subject to concurrent additional capital
requirements, which could increase and lead to lower returns on equity.

**_The Banking Union may impose additional regulatory requirements that may impact the Bank's_**
**_results._**

The European Commission established a new common regulation (the Single Rule Book) and
supervisory architecture. The Banking Union comprises the Single Supervisory Mechanism ("SSM"),
the Single Resolution Mechanism ("SRM") and the European Deposits Insurance Scheme ("EDIS").
The regulatory framework under the Banking Union and future modifications to it may result in, or
require changes to, the strategic positioning of financial institutions, including their business model and
risk exposure, and could result in additional costs in order to ensure compliance with the new
requirements and may potentially restrict the Bank's ability to comply with its financial undertakings
regarding debt and equity instruments. See further "Description of the Business of the Group – Recent
_developments on the banking regulation"._

30


-----

_Single Supervisory Mechanism_

The Banking Union assigned the role of direct banking supervisor to the ECB to ensure that the largest
banks in Europe, including the Bank, are independently supervised under common rules. The Bank is
currently in compliance with SREP requirements. If the Bank's capital ratios fall below the thresholds
specified or guided by the relevant regulatory entities (including pursuant to the Supervisory Review
and Evaluation Process ("SREP")) the Bank may need to adopt additional measures to strengthen its
capital ratios (including at unfavourable terms), such as an acceleration of deleveraging, the reduction
of RWA, divestments and other measures that may include rights issues. Furthermore, any additional
capital adequacy requirements imposed on the Bank may result in the need to increase its capital buffers
in order to fulfil more demanding capital ratio requirements, thereby increasing the costs to the Bank
and reducing the return on equity. Any of the aforementioned situations could have a material adverse
effect on the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

During the SREP, the supervisor not only defines banks’ capital requirements (e.g. Pillar 2 capital
requirements ("P2R") and Pillar 2 capital guidance ("P2G")), but may also decide to impose additional
measures on banks, including liquidity and qualitative measures. See further "Description of the
_Business of the Group – Recent developments on the banking regulation"._

A change in the prudential supervision framework may:

- impose additional capitalisation demands on the Bank, in particular if the ECB requires the
reclassification of assets and/or a revision of coverage levels for impairment, which could result
in the Bank being subject to additional capital requirements, or to any future stress tests;

- given the classification of the Bank as an O-SII, lead to higher combined capital buffer
requirements;

- lead to a higher countercyclical capital buffer and capital conservation buffer.

If, following a capital requirement exercise, such as a stress test, capital quality or risk management
assurance exercise or equivalent exercise, a capital deficit is identified, it could adversely affect the cost
of funding for the Bank and have a materially adverse impact on its business, financial condition, results
of operations and prospects.

The Bank is also currently compliant with the CRD IV required liquidity related ratios, i.e., the liquidity
coverage ratio ("LCR") which requires banks to hold sufficient unencumbered high quality liquid assets
to withstand a 30-day stressed funding scenario, and the net stable funding ratio ("NSFR") reflecting
the amount available of stable funding to its amount of required stable funding.

These requirements may change in the future which could have an impact on the Bank's capital and
liquidity needs and adversely affect the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects. For more information on the topics above see further "The results of additional stress tests
_could result in a need to increase capital or a loss of public confidence in the Group" and "Description_
_of the Business of the Group – Recent developments on the banking regulation"._

_Single Resolution Mechanism_

The BRRD (which implementation into Portuguese law was completed by Law No. 23-A/2015, of 26
March, as amended, encompassing several changes to Decree-Law No. 298/92, of 31 December (as
amended from time to time, the "Banking Law")) establishes a framework for the recovery and
resolution of credit institutions and investment companies which contemplates that capital instruments
(such as the Subordinated Notes) may be subject to non-viability loss absorption, in addition to the

31


-----

application of the general bail-in tool (which may apply to any of the Notes). As such, the use of
resolution tools and powers provided for by the Banking Union may disrupt the rights of shareholders
and creditors. In particular, the power of the authorities to transfer the shares or all or part of the assets
of an institution to a private purchaser without the consent of shareholders affects the property rights of
shareholders. In addition, the power to decide which liabilities to transfer out of a failing institution
based upon the objectives of ensuring the continuity of services and avoiding adverse effects on
financial stability may affect the equal treatment of creditors. For further details please see "Description
_of the Business of the Group – Recent developments on the banking regulation"._

To avoid having institutions structuring their liabilities in a way that impedes the effectiveness of the
bail-in or other resolution tools and to avoid the risk of contagion or a bank run, the BRRD requires that
institutions meet a robust minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities ("MREL") at all
times. In order to meet MREL requirements, the Bank may need to issue MREL-eligible instruments,
impacting its funding structure and financing costs. Such mechanisms and procedures, besides having
the capacity to restrain the Bank's strategy, could increase the average cost of the Bank's liabilities, in
particular, without limitation, the cost of Additional Tier 1, Tier 2 instruments and other MREL eligible
instruments and thus negatively affect the Bank's earnings. These instruments may also result in a
potential dilution of the percentage of ownership of existing shareholders, given their potential
convertibility features under application of a resolution or other measure or in accordance with their
terms. The aforementioned instruments might be viewed by investors as riskier than other debt
instruments, primarily due to the risk of capital losses, missed coupon payments, insufficient maximum
distributable amount buffer, conversion into capital instruments and lack of available distributable
items. As a result, investor appetite for these instruments may decline in the future, which could render
the Bank unable to place them in the market. In this case, the Bank would have to issue Common Equity
Tier 1 ("CET1") capital to meet the mentioned regulatory requirements or issue Additional Tier 1, Tier
2 or other regulatory eligible instruments that would entail an associated coupon expense which may
have a material adverse effect on the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects. See "Description of the Business of the Group – Trends Information" for more information
on MREL requirements applicable to the Issuer.

Decree-Law No. 31-A/2012, of 10 February, which amended the Banking Law, also introduced the
creation of the privileges accorded to claims associated with loans backed-up by deposits under the
Deposit Guarantee Fund ("DGF"), as well as credit secured by the DGF, the Integrated Mutual
Agricultural Scheme (which, in Portugal, is formed by the Central Mutual Agricultural Bank (Caixa
_Central de Crédito Agrícola Mútua) and its associated banks) or the Portuguese Resolution Fund_
(Fundo de Resolução) (the "Resolution Fund"), arising from the potential financial support that these
institutions might give in the context of the implementation of resolution measures, in each case within
the limits of the applicable laws.

The financial resources of the Resolution Fund result essentially from the initial and periodical
contributions paid by member institutions, the proceeds from the bank levy, created by Law no. 55A/2010, of 31 December, and the returns on the investment of its financial means.

Under Article 153-O of the Banking Law, the Resolution Fund may be required to finance the
implementation of the resolution measures applied by Banco de Portugal and the resulting general and
administrative expenses. At the present date, there is no reliable estimate of the potential losses to be
incurred by the Resolution Fund, notably those that have been publicly mentioned as potentially
applicable arising from (i) the sale of Novo Banco, S.A. ("Novo Banco") (including, without limitation,
the contingent capitalisation mechanism), (ii) the litigation relating to the Banco Espírito Santo, S.A.
("BES") resolution process including in respect of the so-called "lesados do BES" proceedings and the
attempts to find a solution for such proceedings, (iii) the resolution process of Banco Internacional do
Funchal, S.A. ("BANIF") and related expenses, and (iv) the amount and timing of the Bank's
contributions to the Resolution Fund and the reimbursement of the loans granted by the Bank to the

32


-----

Resolution Fund. Thus, the impact of the BES and BANIF resolution processes on the Bank, which
participates in the Resolution Fund, could depend on external factors not controlled by the Bank,
including the proceeds from the Resolution Fund assets, the future funding needs and contingent
liabilities of the Resolution Fund including, without limitation, those related to the sale of Novo Banco
to Lone Star. For further details on the Resolution Fund and related contributions of the Bank see
"Description of the Business of the Group – Recent developments on the banking regulation".

In the event of a shortage of funds, a negative financial impact, of an uncertain nature, on the Resolution
Fund and, indirectly, on the Portuguese banking sector, could occur. The definition of the financing
structure of a possible shortage (in terms of type of contribution, its distribution in time and any recourse
to temporary loans) will depend on the amount of such hypothetical shortage. See "Description of the
_Business of the Group – Recent developments on the banking regulation"._

The amount of the periodical contribution for the Resolution Fund is calculated every year pursuant to
Regulation 1/2013 of Banco de Portugal, as amended by Regulations 8/2014 and 14/2014, using a base
rate which is published by Banco de Portugal. There can be no assurance that in the future Banco de
Portugal will maintain the current base rate. Increases in the base rate in future years may reduce the
Bank's profitability. See "Description of the Business of the Group – Recent developments on the
_banking regulation"._

This situation has been disclosed in the financial statements of the Bank as a contingent liability, with
no impacts recorded on the financials or capital ratios of the Bank. There can be no assurance that such
accounting treatment will be maintained in the future, and as such there is no guarantee that the Bank's
business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and capital ratios will not be affected by
the factors described above.

The impact of the above is uncertain and the Bank can give no assurance that the current
understanding/framework/accounting treatment and related contributions will not be changed in the
future (including that recourse to special contributions may occur) thus negatively impacting BCP's
financial condition, including a negative impact on net income, capital ratios, earnings and long-term
targets.

_European Deposit Insurance Scheme_

The establishment of EDIS is contingent on certain political decisions, in particular as to whether it
should be a system based on the reinsurance between the several national deposit guarantee funds or a
mutualisation mechanism at the European level. The decision and implementation processes of the
guarantee scheme may have material adverse effects on the Bank's business activity, liquidity, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.

The harmonisation of the deposit guarantee system, through Directive 2014/49/EU of the European
Parliament and of the Council, of 16 April 2014, concerning the deposit guarantee systems, resulted in
some significant changes to the systems currently in force in each of the Member States, including
Portugal. The changes contemplate the introduction of size and risk based contributions by entity and
harmonisation of products and depositors covered, maintaining, however, the principle of a harmonised
limit per depositor and not per deposit.

According to the BRRD, and consequently the Banking Law, as amended, including, without limitation,
the amendments of Law No.23-A/2015, of 26 March, banks must ensure that by 3 July 2024, the
financial resources available to a deposit guarantee scheme ("DGS") amount to a target-level of 0.8%
of the amount of DGF-covered deposits.

33


-----

If, after this target level is reached for the first time, the available financial resources come to be less
than two thirds of the target level, Banco de Portugal will set the periodic contributions at a level that
allows the target level to be reached within six years. If the available financial resources are not
sufficient to reimburse the depositors, in the event of unavailability of deposits, DGS members must
pay ex-post contributions not exceeding 0.5% of the DGF-covered deposits for the exercise period of
the DGF. In exceptional circumstances, the DGS can request a higher amount of contribution with the
approval of Banco de Portugal.

The exemption from the immediate payment of ex-ante contributions shall not exceed 30% of the total
amount of contributions raised. This possibility depends on the credit institutions undertaking
irrevocable payment commitments, to pay part of or the whole amount of the contribution which has
not been paid in cash to the DGF, that are fully backed by collateral composed of low-risk assets
unencumbered by any third-party rights and partly or wholly pledged in favour of the DGF at the DGF's
request.

The additional indirect costs of the deposit guarantee systems may be significant and can consist of
costs associated with the provision of detailed information to clients about products, costs of compliance
with specific regulations on advertising for deposits or other products similar to deposits. They can
therefore affect the activity of the relevant banks and consequently their business activities, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects. As a result of these developments, the Bank may incur
additional costs and liabilities which may adversely affect the Bank's business, operating results,
financial condition and prospects.

**_The resolutions adopted by the European Commission regarding financial services and products in_**
**_the context of disclosure compliance and investor protection, changes in consumer protection laws_**
**_and the legal changes regarding the temporary framework relating to COVID-19 may limit the_**
**_business approach and fees that the Bank can charge in certain banking transactions._**

Several European Commission regulatory initiatives regarding financial services and products have
been transposed/implemented in the past few years, including:

1. The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, Directive 2014/65/EU of the European
Parliament and of the Council, of 15 May 2014, as amended ("MiFID II"), which has been
transposed into the national legal framework by Law No. 35/2018, of 20 July 2018, and is
already in force with some additional related regulations pending, and the Markets in Financial
Instruments Regulation, Regulation (EU) No. 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the
Council, of 15 May 2014, as amended ("MiFIR");

2. Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 26
November 2014, as amended, relating to packaged retail and insurance-based investment
products ("PRIIPs"), complemented by Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 653/2017 of the
Commission, of 8 March 2017, as amended, which applies from 1 January 2018. On 4 January
2018, the CMVM issued a "Circular" regarding PRIIPs subject to the CMVM's supervision,
outlining further applicable requirements and Law 35/2018, of 20 July 2018 introduced the
legal framework for PRIIPs in Portugal; and

3. The European Market Infrastructure Regulation, Regulation (EU) No. 648/2012 of the
European Parliament and of the Council, of 4 July 2012, as amended ("EMIR"), which sets out
procedures regarding over-the-counter ("OTC") markets and derivatives, namely on clearing.

Also, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, approved by the Regulation (EU)
2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 27 April of 2016, as amended ("GDPR"),
replaces the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and was designed to harmonise data privacy laws

34


-----

across Europe, to protect and empower all European Union citizens' data privacy and to reshape the
way organisations across the region approach data privacy.

Furthermore, Decree-Law No. 107/2017, of 30 August 2017, lays down the rules on switching of
payment accounts, the comparability of commissions, as well as the access to payment accounts with
basic features, transposing Directive 2014/92/EU. Changes in consumer protection laws in Portugal
and other jurisdictions where the Bank has operations could limit the fees that banks may charge for
certain products and services, such as mortgages, unsecured loans, credit cards and fund transfers and
remittances. See "Description of the Business of the Group – Recent developments on the banking
_regulation"._

Compliance with these obligations entails increased operational and financial costs for the Bank and
may also affect the provision of financial services to customers, and therefore impact on the Bank's
overall results. Furthermore, some of them are being revised or their full implementation is only
foreseen in the coming years.

The implementation of these legal initiatives could affect the regular functioning of the market and
significantly impact the Bank's business, financial condition, net income and prospects.

**_Temporary framework relating to COVID-19_**

_Changes in Portuguese legislation regarding banking commissions_

Decree-law No. 10-H/2020, of 26 March 2020, establishes exceptional and temporary measures to
promote the acceptance of card-based payments in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It
establishes the suspension of commissions on payment operations: (i) the collection of the fixed
component of any commission, for card payment transactions at automatic payment terminals; (ii)
payment service providers are prohibited from making increases in the variable components of fees per
transaction, as well as other fixed fees which are due for the use of automatic payment terminals in card
payment transactions and (iii) payment service providers cannot include in their pricing the possibility
to charge for new fixed or variable fees relating to the acceptance of card payment transactions made at
automatic payment terminals.

Law no. 7/2020 of 10 April 2020, establishes exceptional and temporary measures in the context of the
COVID-19 pandemic including the suspension, under certain circumstances, of the commission
charged in payments made through digital platforms.

Apart the temporary framework relating to COVID-19 pandemics, other laws may be implemented in
order to limit or suspend other type of commissions.

Further limitations or reductions of commissions charged by banks in Portugal may adversely affect the
business and performance of the Issuer.

_Moratoria on loan repayments_

Decree-Law No. 10-J/2020, of 26 March 2020, as amended, establishes extraordinary measures for debt
protection in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, to which a range of borrowers may adhere.
Moratoria measures include: (i) prohibition of revocation of contracted credit lines and granted loans;
(ii) extension of contracts with capital payment at the end of the contract; (iii) suspension of payments
in respect of claims which are to be repaid in instalments or in respect of other instalments (and
adjustment of the instalments calendar accordingly) and (iv) suspension of interest due during the
extension period which will be capitalised into the value of the loan. The moratoria will be in force

35

until 30 September. See also below "The Bank is exposed to the consequences of the COVID-19
_pandemic"._

The implementation of these legal initiatives or other similar/broader initiatives that may arise in the
future, and which content is unknown, could impact the Bank's business, financial condition, net
income, capital, RWA and prospects namely after the end of moratoria when firms need to revert to
usual payment of instalments and the prudential temporary framework will likely not apply. Some of
the supervisory measures applied by the ECB to banks are temporary in nature, i.e., until further notice,
creating further uncertainty. The ECB has acknowledged that it will monitor the situation and review
this stance when the economic and financial distress related to COVID-19 fades. Similarly, Banco de
Portugal has highlighted the heightened uncertainty about the magnitude and duration of the outbreak.

**_The Bank is subject to compliance risk, which may lead to claims of non-compliance with regulations_**
**_and lawsuits by public agencies, regulatory agencies and other parties._**

Furthermore, as the Bank operates in a highly regulated industry, it may be subject to claims of noncompliance with regulations and lawsuits by public agencies, regulatory agencies and other parties. The
Bank's regulators frequently conduct inspections and request information in respect of the Bank's or its
clients' activities and transactions. Any inspections or other proceedings that are unfavourable to the
Bank may result in sanctions, limitations on its business opportunities, or a reduction of its growth
potential, and may have an adverse effect on the Bank's ability to comply with certain contractual
obligations or retain certain commercial relationships.

Among other's the Bank is subject:

to provisioning requirements, minimum cash level, credit qualification, record-keeping, privacy,
liquidity, permitted investments, contingency, and other prudential and behavioural requirements which
have associated costs; any increase or change in the criteria of these requirements could have an impact
on the Bank's operations and results;

to rules and regulations related to the prevention of money laundering, bribery and terrorism financing.
Compliance with anti-money laundering, anti-bribery and counter-terrorist financing rules entails
significant cost and effort. Non-compliance with these rules may have serious consequences, including
adverse legal and reputational consequences and consequences in the Bank's relationship with its
clients, partners, service providers and other third parties. Although the Bank believes that its current
anti-money laundering, anti-bribery and counter-terrorism financing policies and procedures are
adequate to ensure compliance with applicable legislation, the Bank cannot guarantee that it has in the
past or will comply, at all times, with all applicable rules or that its regulations for fighting money
laundering, bribery and terrorism financing as extended to the whole Group are applied by its employees
under all circumstances; and

to competition regulations. In particular, the Bank is subject to laws prohibiting the abuse of a dominant
market position and prohibiting agreements and/or concerted practices between business entities that
aim to prevent, restrict or distort competition, or have the effect of preventing, restricting or distorting
competition. In cases where the Bank is found to have infringed the relevant rules of Portuguese and/or
European Union competition law, the Bank is subject to the risk of fines of up to 10% of its consolidated
annual turnover in addition to a public announcement of any sanctions issued. In addition to penalties
imposed by the European Commission and/or the Portuguese Competition Authority, the Bank may be
ordered by these entities or by national courts, as applicable, to discontinue certain practices, comply
with behavioural or structural remedies, or pay damages to third parties that demonstrate that they have
been harmed by the Bank's infringement of the competition rules, whether based on an earlier
infringement decision by the relevant authority or independent of any such decision. The Bank may
also be subject to similar consequences in other jurisdictions where it is active, as imposed by

36


-----

competition authorities or national courts of such jurisdictions. This can lead to material adverse effects
on the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_The Bank is subject to obligations and costs resulting from the legal and regulatory framework_**
**_related to the prevention, mitigation and monitoring of asset quality._**

Several regulatory and legislative initiatives have been and continue to be put in place to address asset
quality issues, with particular focus on the non-performing exposures ("NPEs") and/or non-performing
loans ("NPLs") as authorities highlight credit risk and heightened levels of NPLs as key risks facing
euro area banks.

In compliance with the ECB's banking supervision, the Bank has been implementing a NPE reduction
plan which is closely monitored by the ECB, and is globally aligned with the ECB's Guidance on NPL
and subsequent Addendum, which addresses the main aspects of the strategy, governance and
operations relating to an efficient disposal of NPLs, but adjustments and recommendations can follow
from the regular monitoring performed by the supervisor.

BCP's NPE reduction plan is closely monitored by the ECB. Further requirements imposed by the ECB
may arise from the follow-up discussions and new regulations on the matter. This could adversely and
significantly impact the Bank's business, results of operations, financial condition, including capital
position, and prospects.

Following the measures announced by the national Governments to mitigate the negative impacts of
COVID-19 outbreak, the ECB announced a flexible application of the unlikely-to-pay classification for
governmental guarantees and moratoria. It has also announced that guarantees that turn non-performing
will receive favourable treatment in terms of coverage requirements for a period of seven years
following their deterioration. The ECB has asked banks to smooth the procyclicality of IFRS 9
provisioning models as much as possible. It has also recommended all institutions that have not done
so to start applying IFRS 9 on transitional rules. This measure is not applicable to BCP, which has
already implemented IFRS 9 in full.

The implementation of the legal and regulatory framework currently envisaged, as well as any potential
additional regulatory or self-regulation measures, could have a material adverse effect on the Bank's
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. See "Description of the Business of
_the Group – Trends Information and Recent developments on the banking regulation" for further details_
on the implementation of the Bank's NPL strategy and on regulatory developments regarding NPLs and
NPEs.

**_Changes to tax legislation, regulations, higher taxes or lower tax benefits could have an adverse_**
**_effect on the Bank's activity. Implementation of legislation relating to taxation of the financial sector_**
**_could have a material adverse effect on the Bank's results of operations._**

The Bank might be adversely affected by changes in the tax legislation and other regulations applicable
in Portugal, the European Union and other countries in which it operates, as well as by changes in the
interpretation of legislation and regulation by the competent Tax Authorities. In addition, the Bank
might be adversely affected by difficulties in the interpretation of or compliance with new tax laws and
regulations. The materialisation of these risks may have a material adverse effect on the Bank's
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

The various measures approved by the Portuguese Republic to ensure budgetary consolidation,
stimulate the economy and support the banking system have led to a considerable increase of public
debt levels. In the context of low growth, the need to restore the balance of public finances in the
medium term led to increased tax costs through the expansion of the tax base, the increase in tax rates

37


-----

and/or reduction of tax benefits, as well as the increase in restrictions on tax planning practices, which
may directly affect the Bank's net income. Moreover, changes in legislation may require the Bank to
bear additional costs associated with participation in financial stabilisation mechanisms and resolution
funds at a national and European level.

For example, despite the ex-ante Contribution to the Single Resolution Fund to support the application
of resolution measures at EU level, the Bank is still liable to the following bank levy and contributions:

Under Law No. 55-A/2010, of 31 December, and Ministerial Order ("Portaria") No. 121/2011, of 30
March, as amended, a bank levy is applicable to the Bank (EUR 30.4 million in 2018 and EUR 31,7
million in 2019) and will be applied over (a) the Bank's liabilities at a tax rate of 0.11% and (b) the
notional amount of off-balance sheet financial derivatives, excluding hedging derivatives and back-toback derivatives, at a tax rate of 0.0003%. The taxable base is calculated by reference to an annual
average of the monthly balances of the qualifying items, as reflected in the relevant year's approved
accounts.

The Bank is also liable to periodic special and additional contributions that must be paid to the
Portuguese Resolution Fund, as stipulated in Decree-Law No. 24/2013 and Law No. 23-A/2015, of 26
March (EUR 11.2 million in 2018 and 15.9 million in 2019). The periodic contributions are determined
by a base rate, established by the Bank of Portugal through regulatory instruments, to be applied in each
year and which may be adjusted to the credit institution's risk profile based on the objective incidence
of those contributions, deducted from the liability elements that are part of the core capital and
supplementary and from the deposits covered by the Deposit Guarantee Fund.

Additionally, on 14 February 2013 the European Commission published its proposal for a Council
Directive for enhanced co-operation in the form of a financial transaction tax ("FTT"), of which
Portugal would be a member. Currently, after the withdrawal of the Republic of Estonia as a Member
State wishing to participate in the establishment of the enhanced cooperation, 10 countries are
participating in the negotiations on the proposed directive: Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, France,
Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia. At the working party meeting of 7 May 2019,
participating Member States indicated that they were discussing the option of an FTT based on the
French model of the tax, and the possible mutualisation of the revenues among the participating member
states as a contribution to the EU budget.

At this stage, there can be no assurance that an FTT or similar additional bank taxes and national
financial transaction taxes will not be adopted, at any moment, by the authorities of the jurisdictions
where the Bank operates.

Any such additional levies and taxes could have a material adverse effect on the Bank's business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

The Bank also has ongoing ordinary course disputes with the Tax Authorities and, although it considers
the provisions it has made regarding these disputes to be adequate to cover the risk of judgements
against the Bank it is unable to ensure their sufficiency or the outcome of such disputes.

**_The new regulatory framework for insurance companies may negatively impact the Bank's_**
**_operations._**

The Bank has a partnership agreement with an insurance company for the placement of insurance
products through the commercial distribution networks of the Bank, being remunerated for insurance
intermediation services ("bank assurance activity"), and the Bank holds a 49% stake in Millenniumbcp
Ageas Grupo Segurador, S.G.P.S., S.A. ("Millennium bcp Ageas"). Measures, regulations and laws,

review of firms' assessment of risk and enhanced disclosure requirements, affecting the insurance
business may impact on the Bank's business, financial condition, net income and prospects, directly,
through commission's income, or indirectly, through the change of valuation of the equity stake. See
"Description of the Business of the Group – Trends Information and _Recent developments on the_
_banking regulation"._

**_The Bank is subject to changes in financial reporting standards, such as IFRS 9 and IFRS 16, or_**
**_policies, including as a result of choices made by the Bank, which could materially and adversely_**
**_affect the Bank's reported results of operations and financial condition and may have a_**
**_corresponding material adverse impact on capital ratios._**

The Bank's financial statements are prepared in accordance with European Union IFRS, which is
periodically revised or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time the Bank is required to adopt new or
revised accounting standards issued by recognised bodies, mainly the International Accounting
Standards Board. It is possible that future accounting standards which the Bank is required to adopt,
could change the current accounting treatment that applies to its financial statements and that such
changes could have a material adverse effect on the Bank's results of operations and financial condition.

On 1 January 2018, the Group adopted the IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments, replacing the IAS 39 –
Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement which were in force until 31 December 2017.
IFRS 9 establishes new rules for the recognition of financial instruments and introduces relevant
changes, namely in terms of their rating and measurement and also the methodology for calculating the
impairment of financial assets. For this reason, it is a standard that has been subject to a detailed and
complex implementation process that has involved all the key stakeholders in order to understand the
impacts but also the changes in processes, governance and business strategy that may be required. The
requirements of IFRS 9 are applied retrospectively by adjusting the opening balance at the date of initial
application.

The main changes resulting from IFRS 9 are related to impairment requirements. IFRS 9 introduces a
new model for impairment estimates based on expected losses while the model under IAS 39 was based
on incurred losses. The IFRS 9 impairment model is applicable to financial assets valued at amortised
cost, to debt instruments valued at fair value through other comprehensive income, and to contingent
risks and commitments not valued at fair value. It should be underlined that the implementation of the
new standard requires the application of more complex credit risk models of greater predictive power
which require a significantly broader set of source data than the previously applied models.

The Group determines the expected credit losses of each operation as a result of the deterioration of
credit risk since its initial recognition. For this purpose, operations are classified into one of the
following three stages:

(a) Stage 1: operations with no significant increase in credit risk since its initial recognition are
classified in this stage. Impairment losses associated with operations classified in this stage
correspond to expected credit losses resulting from a default event that may occur within 12
months after the reporting date (12-month expected credit losses);

(b) Stage 2: operations with a significant increase in credit risk since its initial recognition but not
impaired are classified in this stage. Impairment losses associated with operations classified in
this stage correspond to the expected credit losses resulting from default events that may occur
over the expected residual life of the operations (lifetime expected credit losses); or

(c) Stage 3: impaired operations are classified in this stage. Impairment losses associated with
operations classified at this stage correspond to lifetime expected credit losses.

39


-----

As a result of IFRS 9, the Bank recognised credit losses on loans and other financial instruments based
on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Considering allowance for credit losses will be based
on forward-looking information IFRS 9 has led to an increase in subjectivity. The forward-looking
information mentioned takes into account the evaluation of future macro-economic conditions which
are monitored on a continuous basis and that are also used for management and internal planning. Credit
losses are defined as the expected contractual cash-flows not received over the estimated life of the
financial instrument, discounted at the original interest rate. Following this definition, expected credit
losses correspond to credit losses determined by considering future economic conditions.

As credit losses are recognised at an earlier stage this will lead to a higher loan loss allowance, and
corresponding lower capital on implementation of IFRS 9. In addition, IFRS 9 is expected to lead to
more profit and loss volatility, because changes in counterparty credit quality could lead to shifts from
a 12-month expected loss to a life time expected loss and vice versa. In addition, more financial
instruments may be classified at fair value through profit or loss. An increase in credit loss could have
an impact on lending activities and the potential for greater pro-cyclicality on lending and impairment
exists owing to implementation of IFRS 9. Further changes in financial reporting standards or policies,
including as a result of choices made by the Group, could have a material adverse effect on the Bank's
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and may have a corresponding material
adverse effect on capital ratios.

The Group adopted IFRS 16 – Lease transactions on 1 January 2019, replacing IAS 17 – Lease
transactions, which was in force until 31 December 2018. The Group did not adopt any of the
requirements of IFRS 16 in prior periods. This standard establishes the new requirements regarding the
scope, classification/recognition and measurement of leases:

from the lessor's perspective, leases will continue to be classified as finance leases or operating leases;

from the lessee's perspective, the standard defines a single model of accounting for lease contracts,
which results in the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases, except for those
which the lease term ends within 12 months or for those which the underlying asset is of low-value and,
in these cases, the lessee may opt for the exemption from recognition under IFRS 16, and shall recognise
the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense. The Group chose not to apply this
standard to short-term lease contracts, i.e. contracts with a term shorter than or equal to one year, and
to lease contracts in which the underlying asset's value is below EUR 5,000. Additionally, this standard
is not applied to leases of intangible assets.

Regarding income statement, the adoption of IFRS 16 led to changes in the items regarding
depreciation, other administrative costs and net interest income, with the net impacts being recognised
as immaterial.

Following the measures announced by the national governments to mitigate the negative impacts of the
COVID-19 outbreak, the ECB announced a flexible application of the unlikely-to-pay classification for
governmental guarantees and moratoria. It has also announced that guarantees that turn non-performing
will receive favourable treatment in terms of coverage requirements for a period of seven years
following their deterioration. The ECB has asked banks to smooth the procyclicality of IFRS 9
provisioning models as much as possible.

If the Bank's regulators adopt or interpret more stringent standards or views on the applicable standards
than the Bank anticipates, the Bank could experience unanticipated changes in its reported financial
statements, including but not limited to restatements or the inclusion of reserves in review or audit
reports, which could adversely affect the Bank's business due to litigation and loss of investor
confidence in its financial statements.

40


-----

**_The Bank's financial statements in conformity with EU IFRS require the exercise of judgements and_**
**_use of assumptions and estimates which, if incorrect, could have a material impact on the Bank's_**
**_business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects and capital ratios._**

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with European Union IFRS requires management
to exercise judgement and use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, equity, income and expenses. Due primarily to the inherent uncertainty in making estimates,
actual results reported in future periods may be based upon amounts which differ from those estimates.
For example, due primarily to the inherently uncertain outcome of settlements of claims and litigation,
it is difficult to provide for sufficient legal and regulatory provisions, and if the provisions made turn
out not to be sufficient, the Bank will have to report additional losses.

Judgements, estimates, and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical
experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances and known at the date of preparation and issuance of the respective financial
statements. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is
revised and in any future periods affected. The accounting policies deemed critical to the Bank's results
and financial condition, based upon materiality and significant judgements and estimates, include the
following areas: impairment of the financial assets available for sale, losses due to impairments in credit
to clients, fair value of derivative financial instruments, investments held to maturity, entities included
in the consolidation perimeter, taxes on profit, pensions and other benefits to employees, goodwill
impairments and impairments in non-current assets held for sale (properties). If the exercise of
judgement and the use of estimates and assumptions by the Group in preparing its consolidated financial
statements in conformity with European Union IFRS are subsequently found to be incorrect, this could
have a material impact on the Bank's business, results of operations and financial condition, including
capital ratios.

**_The use of standardised contracts and forms carries certain risks._**

The Bank maintains contractual relationships with a large number of clients. The management of such
a large number of legal relationships involves the use of general terms and conditions and standard
templates for contracts and forms. This could pose a significant risk to the large number of contracts
containing subjects that need clarification and drafting errors or requiring individual terms and
conditions. In light of recent amendments to the applicable legal frameworks as a result of new laws or
judicial decisions, it is possible that not all standard contracts and forms used by the Bank comply with
every applicable legal requirement at all times.

If there are drafting errors or interpretive issues, or if the individual contractual terms or the contracts
are invalid in their entirety or in part, many client relationships may be negatively affected. Any
resulting claims for compensation or other legal consequences may have an adverse effect on the Bank's
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**1.3** **Risks relating to Acquisitions**

**_The Bank may be the object of an unsolicited acquisition bid._**

In light of the ongoing trend in Europe towards consolidation in the banking sector, and like any listed
company, the Bank could be the target of an unsolicited acquisition bid. If such an acquisition were to
occur, there could be changes in its corporate strategy, the main focus of its business, or its operations
and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on the Bank's business, financial condition
or results.

41


-----

**_The Bank or its subsidiaries may engage in mergers and/or acquisitions._**

Although the Bank's strategic plan is focused on organic growth and while it has reinforced its
commitment to its strategic goals, there is no guarantee that it will not participate in mergers and/or
acquisitions in Portugal or elsewhere should such opportunities arise. In the event the Bank or any of
its subsidiaries participates in mergers and/or acquisitions, there could be changes in its corporate
strategy, in its organisation and structure, its main business focus, its resources, and in its financial
condition and results of operations. Additionally, if the Bank or its subsidiaries were to engage in such
an operation, it is possible that the Bank may not be able to extract all the cost and/or revenue synergies,
totally or partially, associated with such mergers and/or acquisitions. The Bank may also have to bear
additional personnel costs resulting from any restructurings needed to integrate acquired operations or
businesses successfully. Moreover, future mergers or acquisitions could result in unexpected losses
due to unforeseen liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Bank's business,
financial condition or results of operations.

**1.4** **Risks relating to the Bank's Business**

**_The Bank is exposed to the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic._**

A widespread global pandemic of the severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (commonly known as
SARS-CoV-2) and of the infectious disease COVID-19, caused by the virus, is currently taking place
worldwide, affecting the lives of a large portion of the global population.

The range of implications of this pandemic is not yet fully determined but it is already foreseeable that
it will have a material adverse impact on the Portuguese economy, as well as on the economies of all
other jurisdictions in which the BCP Group operates.

The COVID-19 pandemic is leading to an adverse economic shock, with very substantial effects on
business activities. Therefore, the Portuguese economy is forecasted to undergo a significant
deterioration as a result of the pandemic. On 26 March 2020, the Bank of Portugal announced that the
recession of the Portuguese economy in 2020 could be between -3.7% in a baseline scenario and -5.7%
in an adverse scenario (Source: Bank of Portugal, Economic Bulletin, 26 March 2020). On 14 April
2020, the IMF announced that it expected a more severe recession, with a contraction of -8% of the
Portuguese GDP in 2020 (Source: IMF, WEO, April 2020), as the pandemic and the necessary
lockdown measures had aggravated. In 2021, both institutions foresee a gradual recovery of the
Portuguese economy. However, there is heightened uncertainty underlying this scenario and the
possibility of the impact of the pandemic crisis may assume a more persistent nature as a result of the
destruction of installed productive capacity.

The pandemic has led to the declaration of state of emergency in various countries, including Portugal,
as well as the imposition of travel restrictions, the establishment of quarantines and the temporary
shutdown of various institutions and businesses and several institutions have taken unprecedented
measures, such as having the vast majority of its employees now working remotely.

The BCP Group is following a contingency plan (the "Contingency Plan") adapted to the pandemic
scenario, which has been updated specifically for the current crisis, and has created a specific Crisis
Management Office for this effect. In this context, in line with the guidelines issued by the authorities
and supervisory entities, the Bank has defined an action plan aimed at protecting customers and
employees, mitigating the probability of contagion and ensuring the operational continuity of the
business. Guidance was also issued to service providers. See "Description of the Business of the Group
_– Trends Information" for further details on the implementation of the Bank's Contingency Plan._

42


-----

Notwithstanding the existence of the Contingency Plan, the spread of the virus amongst the Bank's
employees, or any quarantines affecting the Bank's employees or facilities, may reduce the Bank
personnel's ability to carry out their work as usual.

Furthermore, the current COVID-19 pandemic and any potential future outbreaks may also have a
material adverse effect on the Bank's counterparties and/or clients, resulting in additional default risk
for the Bank by exposing the Bank to a potential increase in the number of defaults and insolvencies
among its counterparties and/or clients.

Measures were already implemented by the Portuguese Government and the Bank has also announced
voluntary measures to address the impact of the pandemic which have an impact on the Bank. Further
potential measures may be implemented by the Portuguese Government and the Bank which can also
have an impact on the Bank.

The Portuguese Government announced a 6-month moratorium (for the avoidance of doubt it does not
imply a cancellation or pardon of any amount) on loan payments (capital and/or interest) until 30
September 2020 (Decree-Law No. 10-J/2020, of 26 March 2020, as amended (the "Decree-Law No.
**10-J/2020")). The moratorium is available for individuals (in particular, borrowers under mortgage**
loans to finance their own permanent residence and entrepreneurs (empresários em nome individual))
and companies that are not in the financial sector (as well as certain third sector entities who can also
apply to the moratorium), depending on the fulfilment of certain conditions. Decree-Law No. 10-J/2020
also foresees the granting of guarantees by the Portuguese State, including to non-financial corporate
entities, subject to certain conditions.

To help families and businesses overcome the economic challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,
BCP has launched a set of measures worth a total of EUR 4.7 billion, addressed to both individuals and
companies. See "Description of the Business of the Group – Trends Information" for further details on
the set of measures launched by BCP.

Following the issue by the EBA, on 2 April 2020, of guidelines on public and private moratoria on loan
operations in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic (EBA/GL/2020/02), on 16 April 2020, the members
of the Portuguese Banking Association (including BCP) signed a protocol setting the basis for two types
of private moratoria, both of which are for individuals who may be residents or non-residents in
Portugal. One covers non-mortgage loans (i.e. personal or car loans) and the other mortgage loans.

It is not possible at this stage to assess all the specific measures that may be implemented to curb the
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Another possible consequence of the ongoing pandemic, and any potential future outbreaks, could be
an adverse impact on the real estate market, including a decrease in the value of real estate assets, which
could negatively affect the Bank's pool of real estate assets. Temporary measures in Portugal to tackle
the epidemic caused by COVID-19 have already established the temporary suspension of foreclosures
of mortgages over real estate property used for permanent residence.

Finally, cost-of-risk could increase as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, in particular if the Bank
follows the same approach as banks in other geographies, such as Spain, where banks are frontloading
provisions to address the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the Bank booked total
COVID-19 related provisions amounting to EUR 78.8 million in the first quarter of 2020, of which
EUR 60.0 million in Portugal and EUR 18.8 million in the international operations (EUR 10.2 million,
net of non-controlling interests).

43


-----

Also, the pace of reduction of NPEs going forward is not expected to be maintained. Until the end of
2019, the Bank was reducing NPEs at a pace of 25% to 30% per year. NPE sales should decline as a
result of the COVID-19.

Any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on the Bank's business, financial condition
results of operations and prospects, therefore affecting the Bank's ability to make the payments under
the Notes.

**_The Bank is exposed to risks related to FX-indexed mortgage loans._**

Regarding mortgage loans granted by Bank Millennium S.A. ("Bank Millennium") in Poland in CHF
until 2008, there are risks related to verdicts issued by polish courts in individual lawsuits against banks
(including Bank Millennium) raised by borrowers of foreign exchange indexed ("FX-indexed")
mortgage loans.

The vast majority of verdicts in lawsuits concerning Bank Millennium have been favourable to the Bank
so far. However, it should be noted that there is a significant risk that such favourable verdicts may not
continue to be verified, as a result of which pending lawsuits' verdicts may not be taken in accordance
with the Bank's expectations. If such risk materializes, it may have a significant negative impact on
Bank Millennium.

On 3 October 2019, the Court of Justice of the European Union ("CJEU") issued a judgment on Case
C-260/18, in connection with the preliminary questions formulated by the District Court of Warsaw in
the lawsuit against Raiffeisen Bank International AG. The judgment of CJEU, combined with the
interpretation of European Union Law, is binding on domestic courts.

CJEU's judgment concerns only the situations where the national court has previously found the contract
terms to be abusive. It is the exclusive competence of the national courts to assess, in the course of
judicial proceedings, whether a particular contract term can be identified as abusive in the circumstances
of the lawsuit. It can be reasonably assumed that the legal issues relating to FX-indexed mortgage loans
will be further examined by the national courts within the framework of the disputes considered, which
could possibly result in the emergence of further interpretations relevant for the assessment of the risks
associated with subject matter proceedings. This circumstance indicates the need for constant analysis
of these matters. Further requests for clarification and ruling addressed to the CJEU and the Supreme
Court of Poland with potential impact on the outcome of the court cases may also be filed.

As at 2019, the Bank had 2,010 FX-indexed mortgage loans under individual litigations, submitted to
the courts with the total value of claims filed by the plaintiffs amounting to PLN 203 million
(EUR 47.74 million). Until 31 December 2019, only 19 of these cases had obtained a final verdict,
being the vast majority in accordance with the Bank's interest. For further details, please see "General
_Information – Litigation"._

According to the Polish Bank Association (ZBP), during 2019, over 70% of the lawsuits regarding FXindexed mortgage loans obtained a final verdict favourable to the banks involved. However, after the
CJEU judgment regarding Case C-260/18 issued on 3 October 2019, there is a risk that this so far
positive scenario for the banks may change.

Considering the increased legal risk related to FX-indexed mortgages, Bank Millennium created a
provision in the amount of PLN 223 million (EUR 52.45 million) for legal risk. The methodology
developed by Bank Millennium is based on the following main parameters: (i) the number of current
(including class actions) and potential future court cases that will appear within a specified (three-year)
time horizon; (ii) the amount of Bank Millennium's potential loss in the event of a specific court
judgment (three negative judgment scenarios were taken into account); and, (iii) the probability of

44


-----

obtaining a specific court verdict calculated on the basis of statistics of judgments of the banking sector
in Poland and legal opinions obtained. Variation in the level of provisions or concrete losses will
depend on the final court decisions about each case and on the number of court cases.

Bank Millennium undertakes several actions at different levels towards different stakeholders in order
to mitigate legal and litigation risk regarding the FX-indexed mortgage loans portfolio. Bank
Millennium is open to negotiate case-by-case favourable conditions for early repayment (partial or total)
or the conversion of loans to PLN. On the other hand, Bank Millennium will continue to take all
possible actions to protect its interests in courts while, at the same time, being open to find settlement
with customers in the court under reasonable conditions.

An increase of unfavourable verdicts related to cases in Courts related to FX-indexed mortgages loans
may require additional provisions by Bank Millennium, thus affecting the results of the Bank and the
consolidated results do BCP Group.

**_The Bank is exposed to the credit risk of its customers._**

The Bank is exposed to its customers' credit risk. Gross exposure to risk of credit (position in original
risk) on 31 December 2019 was EUR 96.2 billion.

As at 31 December 2019, the breakdown of this exposure was the following: EUR 15.7 billion for
central governments or central banks, EUR 0.8 billion for regional administrations or local authorities,
EUR 0.3 billion for administrative entities and non-profit organisations, EUR 0.04 billion for
multilateral development banks, EUR 3.2 billion for other credit institutions, EUR 66.3 billion for retail
and companies customers and EUR 9.9 billion for other elements.

According to Banco de Portugal latest available data, Portugal's NPE coverage by loan loss reserves
("LLR") was 53.5% in the first nine months of 2019 and the NPE ratio (loans only) stood at 7.7%. The
Bank NPEs (loans only) as at 31 December 2019 were EUR 4.2 billion (7.7%) with a coverage by
impairments of 58% and a coverage by impairments, collaterals and Expected Loss Gap of 116%.

The materialisation of the recession scenario forecasted by several entities, notably the Bank of Portugal
and the IMF as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, could increase the Bank’s cost-of-risk.

A general deterioration of the Portuguese economy (and of the global economy) and the systemic risk
of financial systems due to structural imbalances could affect the recovery and value of the Bank's assets
and require increased credit impairments, which would adversely affect the Bank's financial condition
and results of operations. This could further increase the Bank's NPL and NPE ratios and impair the
Bank's loan portfolio and other financial assets.

**_The Bank is exposed to further deterioration of asset quality._**

The value of assets collateralising the Bank's secured loans could decline significantly as a result of a
general decline in market prices or a decline in the value of the asset class underlying the collateral,
which could result in an increase of the impairment recognised for the collateralised loans granted by
the Group. Loan volume to both businesses and individuals is expected to remain depressed in Portugal
due primarily to downward pressure of austerity measures on household disposable income and the
firms' profitability, as well as the resulting deterioration in the business environment, more restrictive
credit conditions and stressed liquidity. A decline in equity and debt market prices could also have an
impact on the quality of the Bank's collateral linked to financial assets leading to a reduction in coverage
ratios.

-----

In light of the Portuguese macroeconomic situation and the Bank's older loan exposures to some of the
more vulnerable sectors in the economy, in 2019, the Bank continued to increase the level of coverage
through impairments and collateral.

The SSM publicly released, on 22 August 2019, clarifications on topics related to the NPE coverage
rules. As a result banks will have 7 years to provision collateralized NPEs and 9 years for collateralized
NPEs with real estate collateral and 3 years for other non-collateralized NPEs.

For new NPEs generated from 26 April 2019, the provision coverage requirement becomes less
stringent (it takes longer before 100% coverage is expected).

For new NPEs generated between 1 April 2018 and 25 April 2019 the previous coverage requirement
is maintained, as well as for the stock of NPEs (all those generated before that date).

The Bank's consolidated gross loan portfolio, as at 31 December 2019, was EUR 54.7 billion (of which
EUR 52.3 billion were recorded in the caption "Financial assets at amortised cost – Loans to customers",
EUR 2.1 billion were recorded in the caption "Debt securities held associated with credit operations"
and EUR 0.4 billion were recorded in the caption "Financial assets not held for trading mandatorily at
fair value through profit or loss - Loans and advances to customers at fair value"). The ratio of NPEs
(loans only) stood at 7.7% as at 31 December 2019, compared to 10.9% as at 31 December 2018. As
at 31 December 2019, the loan portfolio in Portugal amounted to EUR 36.7 billion. In Portugal, the
ratio of NPEs stood at 8.8% as at 31 December 2019, compared to 12.9% as at 31 December 2018.

NPEs in Portugal amounted to EUR 3.2 billion as at 31 December 2019, with EUR 0.7 billion of NPEs
relating to individuals and EUR 2.5 billion to companies. 52% of NPEs are NPLs more than 90 days.
NPE coverage as at 31 December 2019 was 118% for Companies (67% by LLRs, 29% by real estate
collateral and 22% by other collateral and EL gap) and 102% for Individuals (26% by LLRs, 72% by
real estate collateral and 3% by other collateral and EL gap). NPLs more than 90 days' coverage as at
31 December 2019 was 124% for Companies (77% by LLRs, 13% by real estate collateral and 34% by
other collateral and EL gap) and 102% for Individuals (32% by LLRs, 66% by real estate collateral and
4% by other collateral and EL gap). Other NPE coverage as at 31 December 2019 was 112% for
Companies (56% by LLRs, 45% by real estate collateral and 11% by other collateral and EL gap) and
101% for Individuals (19% by LLRs, 80% by real estate collateral and 2% by other collateral and EL
gap).

The persistence of volatility and adverse economic and financial circumstances at worldwide, European
and national levels increase the risk of deterioration of the quality of the consolidated loan portfolio and
may also lead to increased impairment losses and deterioration of the regulatory capital ratios. Loan
impairment (net of recoveries) amounted to EUR 390.2 million in 2019, recorded in the caption
"Impairment for financial assets at amortised cost – Loans and advances to customers", EUR 464.6
million as at 31 December 2018, recorded in the caption "Loans impairment", and EUR 623.7 million
as at 31 December 2017, recorded in the caption "Loans impairment". From 2011 to 31 December
2019, the Bank made impairment provisions amounting to EUR 8,141 million. Cost of risk[1], measured
by the proportion of loan impairment annualised charges (net of recoveries) compared to loans to
customers (gross), stood at 72 basis points in 2019, compared to 92 basis points in 2018, 122 basis
points in 2017 and 216 basis points in 2016. The persistence, or deepening, of the crisis, general market
volatility, sluggish economic growth and increased unemployment, coupled with either decreased
consumer spending or a sharp increase in risk premiums required would lead to increased loan
impairment costs and, consequently, to the reduction of the Bank's net income. In addition, the level of
impairment and other reserves may not be sufficient to cover possible future impairment losses, and it
may be necessary to create additional provisions of significant amounts. Any failure in risk

loans (gross).

management or control policies relating to credit risk could adversely affect the Bank's business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

In Poland, the NPL ratio as at 31 December 2019 was 2.7%, compared to 2.5% as at 31 December 2018.

In Mozambique, the NPL ratio as at 31 December 2019 was 16.7%, compared to 16.4% as at 31
December 2018.

Credit risk and deterioration of asset quality are mutually reinforcing. If there is any reduction in the
value of assets securing loans that have been granted or if the value of assets is not sufficient to cover
the exposure to derivative instruments, the Bank would be exposed to an even higher credit risk of noncollection in the case of non-performance, which, in turn, may affect the Bank's ability to comply with
its payment obligations. The Bank cannot guarantee that it would be able to realise adequate proceeds
from disposals of collateral to cover loan losses, or that in the fiscal year 2018 and/or in future reporting
periods, it will not raise impairment charges from recent levels. Deterioration in the credit risk exposure
of the Bank may have a material and adverse effect on the Bank's business, financial condition, results
of operations and prospects.

**_The Bank is vulnerable to fluctuations in interest rates, which may negatively affect net interest_**
**_income and lead to net loss and other adverse consequences._**

As from the end of December 2019, the interest applied by the ECB to the main refinancing operations
is 0%, while the one that applies to permanent deposit facilities is -0.5%. These two interest rates,
which serve as determinant references for the level at which market interest rates are established (in
particular, EURIBOR), were consecutively reduced in the past 5 years.

The Bank's profitability depends largely on its ability to generate a net interest income (the difference
between the interest rates received in credit operations and the interest rates paid to deposits).

A significant part of the Bank's funding comes from retail deposits. In a negative interest rate
environment, the Bank may not be able to reduce the remuneration rate of such deposits consistently
with the reduction of the interest rate applicable to credit operations. On the other hand, very low
interest rates may result in a reduction of deposits stock and force the Bank to resort to more expensive
financing instruments.

The majority of the Bank's credit portfolio is comprised of variable interest rate loans, linked to
EURIBOR. A continuous decline in or maintenance of market interest rates at the current low levels
could lead to the erosion of the Bank's net interest income, which the Bank (given the current
environment in which it operates), may not be able to mitigate through the increase of its loan portfolio.
This could result in material adverse effects on the Bank's business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond the Bank's control, including policy changes
of the monetary authorities and other national and international political constraints. Changes in market
interest rates could affect the interest rates the Bank charges on interest-earning assets differently from
those it pays on interest-bearing liabilities. These differences could reduce the Bank's net interest
income.

Although the data released for the Eurozone related to GDP and inflation confirm a scenario of weak
economic dynamics and absence of inflationary risks, an increase of interest rates in the Eurozone could
increase the costs associated with debt repayment in Portugal and aggravate the financial conditions of
the country in general, namely if the interest rate increase is not adequate for the particular
macroeconomic conditions of the Portuguese economy. An increase in interest rates could reduce

47


-----

demand for loans and the Bank's capacity to grant loans to customers, contribute to increased loan
default and/or increased interest expense with deposits. This could result in material adverse effects on
the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Interest rate changes or volatility may materially and adversely affect the Bank's net income, business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Law No. 32/2018, of 18 July, amending Decree-Law No. 74-A/2017, of 23 June 2017, on credit
agreements for consumers relating to residential real estate property, entered into force on 19 July 2018
and, in the context of residential loan agreements, imposes on banking institutions the obligation to
reflect the existence of negative rates in the calculation of interest rates applicable to the loans.
According to this law, when the sum of the relevant index rate (such as EURIBOR) and the relevant
margin is negative, this negative interest rate amount will have to either (i) be discounted from the
principal amounts outstanding of the relevant loans or (ii) be converted into a credit which may in the
future set off against positive interest rates (and ultimately be paid to the borrowers if it has not fully
been set off at maturity). This could result in material adverse effects on the Bank's business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_The Bank is exposed to concentration risk, including concentration risk in its credit exposure._**

The Bank is exposed to the credit risk of its customers, including risks arising from the high
concentration of individual or economic group exposures in its loan portfolio. The 20 largest loan
exposures of the Bank as at 31 December 2019 represented 7.84% of the total loan portfolio (gross)
(9.3% as at 31 December 2018). The qualified shareholders' loan exposures as at 31 December 2019
represented 0.44% of the total loan portfolio (gross) (0.49% as at 31 December 2018).

The Bank also has high sectoral concentration in its loan book. As at 31 December 2019, the Bank's
credit exposure to the real estate and civil construction sectors was 3.1% (real estate activities) and 3.1%
(construction companies) of the total loan portfolio at the amortized cost (gross). On that date, 47.6%
of the loan portfolio consisted of mortgage loans, the exposure to retail and wholesale commerce was
6.4% and the exposure to service sector companies was 15.8%.

As at 31 December 2018, the Bank's credit exposure to the real estate and civil construction sectors was
7% (real estate activities) and 4.0% (construction companies) of the total loan portfolio at the amortized
cost (gross). On that date, 46.7% of the loan portfolio consisted of mortgage loans, the exposure to
retail and commerce was 6.9% and the exposure to service sector companies was 17.3%.

Concentration is common for most of the main Portuguese banks, given the small size of the Portuguese
market, and has been noted by the rating agencies as a fundamental challenge facing the Portuguese
banking system. Rating agencies have been particularly critical of the Bank's exposure to larger
customers and, especially, exposure to its shareholders. Although the Bank carries out its business
based on strict risk control policies, in particular with respect to credit risk, and seeks to increase the
diversification of its loan portfolio, it is not possible to guarantee that the exposure to these groups will
not be increased or that exposure will fall in the future. If exposure increases in the future, it could have
a material adverse effect on the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_The Bank is exposed to a contraction of the real estate market._**

The Bank is highly exposed to the Portuguese real estate market by means of the credit granted to
construction companies, real estate activities, and mortgage loans, which represented 3.1%, 3.1% and
47.6% of the consolidated loan portfolio at the amortized cost, respectively, as at 31 December 2019 in
assets related to its operations or obtained in lieu of payment, and indirectly through properties securing
loans or through funding of real estate development projects (assets received in lieu of payment in

48


-----

Portugal represented 1.2% of total assets of the Bank as at 31 December 2019), and through the exposure
to closed-ended real estate funds and to the pension fund and real estate properties in the Bank's balance
sheet.

Assets held on the Bank's balance sheet received in lieu of payment (real estate assets only) decreased
from EUR 1,474 million as at 31 December 2018 to 1,020 million as at 31 December 2019 (impairments
of EUR 205 million as at 31 December 2018 and 184 million as at 31 December 2019). The coverage
of assets received in lieu of payment stood at 13.9% as at 31 December 2018 and 18.0% as at 31
December 2019. In 31 December 2019, the Bank sold 5,689 properties, from its stock of properties, for
EUR 675 million, above its book value of EUR 599 million.

The exposure to closed-end investment funds, whose units were received following operations where
properties were recovered in lieu of payment and that, in accordance with IAS/IFRS, were subject to
consolidation, represented EUR 371 million as at 31 December 2019 (EUR 371 million as at 31
December 2018). The item Investment Properties includes the amount EUR 13 million as at 31
December 2019 and EUR 11.1 million as at 31 December 2018, concerning properties held by Fundo
de Investimento Imobiliário Imosotto Acumulação, by Fundo de Investimento Imobiliário Gestão
Imobiliário, by Fundo de Investimento Imobiliário Imorenda, by Fundo de Investimento Imobiliário
Fechado Gestimo and by Imoport – Fundo de Investimento Imobiliário Fechado.

The Bank also performed a set of transactions involving the sale of financial assets for funds specialising
in the recovery of loans, including Fundo Recuperação Turismo FCR, Fundo Reestruturação
Empresarial FCR, FLIT, Fundo Recuperação FCR, Fundo Aquarius FCR, Discovery Real Estate Fund
and Fundo Vega FCR.

The item Properties, which includes the real estate booked in the pension fund's financial statements
and used by Group companies, in the pension fund amounted to EUR 245 million recorded as at 31
December 2019, and EUR 245.3 million as at 31 December 2018.

Accordingly, the Bank is vulnerable to a contraction in the real estate market. A significant devaluation
of prices in the Portuguese real estate market would lead to impairment losses in the assets directly held
and to an increased exposure to counterparty risk for loans guaranteed by real estate collateral and in
pension fund assets retained by the Bank, adversely affecting the Bank's business, financial condition
and results of operations. Mortgage loans represented 47.6% of the total loan portfolio as at 31
December 2019) (46.2% as at 31 December 2018), with a low delinquency level and an average loanto-value ratio of 60%. Although Portugal did not face a housing bubble during the recent financial
crisis as did other European countries, such as Ireland and Spain, the economic and financial crisis still
had an impact on the real estate market. Portuguese banks are granting a low amount of new mortgage
loans with very low spreads, and real estate developers have encountered a difficult market for sales.
Moreover, there was a reduction in public works activity that severely affected construction companies,
which had to redirect their activities to foreign markets. Furthermore, difficult credit conditions
associated with the contraction of tourism have affected certain real estate developers that had been
involved with tourism related projects, in particular in the southern part of Portugal. All of the
aforementioned effects have increased delinquency among construction companies and real estate
developers, impacting the Bank's NPEs (loans only) and contributing to the increase in impairment
charges.

The materialisation of the recession scenario forecasted by several entities, notably the Bank of Portugal
and the IMF, as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak could result in fewer housing transaction in 2020.
The fall in housing transactions could result in sellers having to adjust price downwards.

A significant devaluation of prices in the Portuguese real estate market may lead to an increase in
impairment losses in the assets held directly and in the participating units of the restructuring funds,

49


-----

and increased exposure in counterparty risk for loans guaranteed by real estate collateral and in pension
fund assets retained by the Bank. Any of the foregoing could have a materially adverse effect on the
Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_The Bank holds units issued by specialised credit recovery closed-end funds that are subject to_**
**_potential depreciation, for which reimbursement may not be requested and for which there is no_**
**_secondary market._**

The Bank performed a set of transactions comprising the sale of financial assets (namely loans to
customers) to funds specialising in loan recovery. These funds manage the companies or the assets
received as collateral with the objective of achieving a pro-active management through the
implementation of operation/valuation plans of such companies. The financial assets sold through these
transactions were removed from the Bank's balance sheet, as the transactions result in the transfer of a
substantial portion of the risks and benefits associated with the assets to the funds, in addition to any
control exercised thereof.

The funds specialised in credit recovery that purchased the financial assets from the Group are closedend funds, wherein the participants have no ability to request the reimbursement of their investment
throughout the useful life of the fund. Furthermore, given their intrinsic characteristics and those of the
underlying assets, there is no secondary market operating for the participation units, which makes their
sale to third parties very unlikely.

These participation units are held by several banks, which are the sellers of the loans, in proportions
that vary through the useful life of the funds, guaranteeing however that no bank may hold more than
50% of each fund's capital.

The Bank's total exposure to funds specialised in the recovery of loans was EUR 924 million as at
31 December 2019. For further details on this topic, please also see "The Bank is exposed to market
_risk, which could result in the devaluation of investment holdings or affect its trading results."_

A possible deterioration in the prospects for recovery of the loans transferred to specialised closed-end
funds may result in the devaluation of the Net assets attributable to unit holders ("NAV") of the held
participation units that cannot be sold, leading to additional impairments. As a consequence of the
negative impacts of COVID-19, there could be a delay in the sale of the units of corporate restructuring
funds. This could have a material adverse effect on the Bank's business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

**_The Bank is exposed to counterparty risk, including credit risk of its counterparties._**

The Bank routinely transacts with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers
and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and other institutional
clients.

Sovereign credit pressures may weigh on Portuguese financial institutions, limiting their funding
options and weakening their capital adequacy by reducing the market value of their sovereign and other
fixed income holdings. These liquidity concerns have adversely impacted, and may continue to
adversely impact, interim institutional financial transactions in general. Concerns about, or a default
by, one financial institution could lead to significant liquidity problems and losses or defaults by other
financial institutions, as the commercial and financial soundness of many financial institutions may be
closely related as a result of credit, trading, clearing and other relationships. Many of the routine
transactions the Bank enters into expose it to significant credit risk in the event of default by one of its
significant counterparties. Even the perceived lack of creditworthiness of, or questions about, a
counterparty may lead to market-side liquidity pressures or losses or ultimately to an inability of the

50


-----

Bank to repay its debt. In addition, the Bank's credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral it
holds cannot be enforced upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the
loan or derivative exposure. A default by a significant financial and credit counterparty, or liquidity
problems in the financial services industry in general, could have a material adverse effect on the Bank's
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Exposure to credit risk may also derive from the collaterals of loans, interbank operations, clearing and
settlement and trading activities as well as other activities and relationships. These relationships include
those with retail customers, brokers and dealers, other commercial banks, investment banks and
corporate borrowers. Most of these relationships expose the Bank to credit risk in the event of default
by the counterparty or customer.

Adverse changes in the credit quality of customers and counterparties of the Bank, a generalised
deterioration of the Portuguese or global economies or the systemic risk of financial systems due
primarily to structural imbalance could affect the recovery and value of the Bank's assets and require
increased impairments, which would adversely affect the Bank's business, financial condition, results
of operations and prospects.

As the Bank expands its business activities, penetrates new market segments and adopts or acquires,
directly or through subsidiaries, new business models, such as consumer lending to new-to-bank
customers, or franchisee-owned branch networks, it may acquire customers with lower credit quality,
which, if such new pursuits were to grow and acquire a significant weight in the business portfolio,
could adversely affect the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_The Bank sells capitalisation insurance products with guaranteed principal and unit linked products,_**
**_exposing the Bank to reputational risk in its role as seller, and financial risk indirectly arising from_**
**_the Group's shareholding in Millenniumbcp Ageas._**

Off-balance sheet customer funds, as at 31 December 2019 totalled EUR 19.1 billion, consisting of
assets under management (EUR 5.7 billion), assets placed with customers (EUR 4.3 billion) and
insurance products (EUR 9.0 billion), including unit linked products (EUR 2.9 billion) and
capitalisation insurance (EUR 5.9 billion), with only the latter being able to ensure capital or a minimum
income.

All financial insurances are predominantly placed with retail investors, those being in their majority
issued and accounted by Millenniumbcp Ageas (in which the Bank has a 49% shareholding) and
registered by the equity method. Therefore, adverse changes in the underlying assets, a general
deterioration of the global economy, or the systemic risk of financial systems due to structural
imbalances may affect the recovery and value of such assets, entailing reputational risks for the Bank
as a seller of these products as well as financial risks indirectly arising out of the shareholding held by
the Group in Millenniumbcp Ageas. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the
Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_The Bank is exposed to the risk of interest rate repricing of credit granted to customers._**

Mortgage loans represented 47.6% of BCP's total loan portfolio at the amortized cost (consolidated) as
at 31 December 2019. The average spread of the mortgage loans portfolio in Portugal stood at 1.31%;
46.6% of the balance of mortgage loans had spreads under 1%. As at 31 December 2019, 65% of the
contracts and 52% of the balance of the mortgage loans portfolio in Portugal were indexed to EURIBOR
3 months and 9% of the contracts and 9% of the balance of the portfolio were indexed to EURIBOR 6
months.

51


-----

The Bank, along with other banks in Portugal, limited the granting of new mortgage loans. In 31
December 2019, 18,392 new mortgage credit operations were contracted with an average spread of
1.37%, compared to 18,016 new mortgage credit operations contracted with an average spread of 1.41%
in 2018. The Bank cannot unilaterally change the contractual terms of the loans that make up its
portfolio of mortgage loans and it has proven extremely difficult to negotiate the extension of the
maturity of these contracts. The resulting limitation of this contractual rigidity has a significant impact
on net interest income. In addition, given the current low demand for credit by companies, the Bank
may also experience difficulties in changing the mix of its loan portfolio which would make it difficult
to offset the impact of reduced spreads on mortgages in the average spread of the loan portfolio.

After a period in which banks implemented policies of interest rate repricing on loans, mainly directed
at loans to companies, a reduction of corporate and consumer loans spreads may be observed in the
future, given the weak credit dynamics in the Portuguese corporate sector. This could have a material
adverse effect on the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Furthermore, a continuation of the historically low interest rate environment may adversely affect the
Bank's net interest income, which in turn would likely have an adverse effect on the Bank's profitability.

**_Financial problems faced by the Bank's customers could adversely affect the Bank._**

Continued market turmoil and poor economic growth, particularly in Portugal and in other European
countries, could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, the activity and/or the financial
conditions of the Bank's customers, which could in turn further impair the Bank's loan portfolio.

The Bank's customers' levels of savings and credit demand are dependent on consumer confidence,
employment trends, the state of the economies in countries where the Bank operates, and the availability
and cost of funding. In addition, customers may further significantly decrease their risk tolerance to
non-deposit based investments such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds. This would adversely affect
the Bank's fee and commission income. Any of the conditions described above could have a material
adverse effect on the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.

**_The Bank faces strong competition in its main areas of activity, notably in the retail business._**

The Portuguese banking market is well developed, containing major national and foreign competitors
which follow multi-product, multi-channel and multi-segment approaches and are, in general, highly
sophisticated. Over recent years, there have been significant developments of banking operations
through the internet and the use of new technology that have enabled banks to assess the needs of their
customers with greater accuracy and efficiency. These factors have contributed to an increase in
competition in the Portuguese banking sector, with new entrants such as Bankinter and Banco CTT who
may adopt aggressive commercial practices in order to gain market share. The sale process of Novo
Banco could add to increased competition as the bank was acquired by an institution with no prior
presence in the Portuguese banking system. Furthermore, many Portuguese banks are dedicated to
increasing their market shares by launching new products, implementing cross-selling strategies and
engaging in more aggressive commercial strategies. Additional integration of European financial
markets may contribute to increased competition, particularly in the areas of asset management,
investment banking, and online banking and brokerage services.

In 2019, the Bank had 2.4 million active customers in Portugal and, the market share in Portugal
(estimates based on figures disclosed by Banco de Portugal and other banking industry associations for
aggregates of the financial system and with adjustments for statistical standardisation) was the
following: 17.1% in loans to customers, 17.7% in loans to companies, 15.8% in loans to individuals,
17.2% in mortgage loans, 9.1% in consumer credit, 18.9% in customer funds, 18.2% in on-balance sheet
customer funds, 17.8% in deposits and 21.0% in off-balance sheet customer funds.

52


-----

The Bank's financial success depends on its capacity to maintain high levels of loyalty among its
customer base and to offer a wide range of competitive and high quality products and services to its
customers. However, high levels of competition in Portugal, as well as in other countries where the
Bank operates and an increased emphasis on cost reduction may result in the Bank's inability to maintain
these objectives. In addition, on 31 December 2019 the Bank operated 505 branches, working towards
its goal of becoming a more digital bank. This resulted in the downsizing of the Bank's branch network
and consequently in BCP's branches' market share in Portugal. This may result in a weaker competitive
position in the Portuguese retail market. As a consequence, this could have a material adverse effect
on the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Moreover, as at 31 December 2019, around 0.9% of the Bank's total domestic customers also held
ordinary shares of the Bank (around 2.6% as at 31 December 2018). If the price of the Bank's ordinary
shares continues to decline, this could lead to shareholder dissatisfaction and, to the extent that such
shareholders are also customers of the Bank, this could result in broader customer dissatisfaction, any
of which could have a material adverse effect on the Bank's business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

There is no assurance that the Bank will be able to compete effectively, or that it will be able to maintain
or improve its operational results. Such inability to compete or maintain results could also lead to a
reduction in net interest income, fees and other income of the Bank, any of which could have a further
significant material adverse effect on the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

**_The Bank may generate lower revenues from commissions and fee-based businesses._**

In 2019, more than 85% of the fees and commissions related to banking (24% to cards and transfers,
24% to loans and guarantees, 17% to bancassurance, 17% to customer account related fees and 3% to
other fees and commissions), with market related fees and commissions accounting for the remaining
15%. A decrease in the volume of lending transactions that the Bank executes with its customers could
result in lower commissions derived from banking operations and guarantees. Moreover, changes to
market sentiment could lead to market downturns that are likely to impact transactional volume,
therefore leading to declines in the Bank's fees. In addition, as the fees that the Bank charges for
managing its' clients' portfolios are, in many cases, based on the value or performance of those
portfolios, a market downturn that reduces the value of the Bank's clients' portfolios or increases the
amount of withdrawals would reduce the revenue the Bank receives from its asset management, private
banking and custody services. Revenue derived from the Bank's asset management business could also
be impacted by below market performance by the Bank's securities investment funds, which could lead
to increased withdrawals and reduced inflows. An increase in withdrawals and a reduction in inflows
could have a significant material adverse effect on the Bank's business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

**_Downgrades in the Bank's credit rating could increase the cost of borrowing funds and make the_**
**_Bank's ability to raise new funds or renew maturing debt more difficult._**

The Bank's ratings are assigned by Moody's Investors Service España, S.A., S&P Global Ratings
Europe Limited, Fitch Ratings Limited and any entity that is part of DBRS group and any successor to
the relevant rating agency. The ratings as of the date of this Offering Circular are the following: (a)
Moody's: "Ba1 (long-term)/NP (short-term)" (re-presented as at 26 July 2019), (b) S&P Global Ratings
Europe Limited: "BB (long-term)/B (short-term)" (re-presented as at 9 October 2018), (c) Fitch Ratings
Limited: "BB (long-term)/B (short-term)" (re-presented as at 6 December 2018) and (d) the relevant
DBRS entity: "BBB(low) (long-term)/R-2 (short-term)" (re-presented as at 3 June 2019).

Credit ratings represent an important component of the Bank's liquidity profile and affect the cost and
other terms upon which the Bank is able to obtain funding. Changes to the Bank's credit ratings reflect,
apart from changes to the rating of the Portuguese Republic, a series of factors intrinsic to the Bank.
Currently, the ratings assigned to the Bank, with the exception of the Critical Obligations Ratings
("COR") assigned by the relevant DBRS entity, are non-investment grade. In terms of capital, and
despite the fact that the rating agencies recognise that the solvency levels of the Bank are better
primarily due to the recapitalisation by the Portuguese State and by shareholders in June and September
2012, respectively, and more recently in July 2014, June 2015, November 2016 and the start of 2017,
and the repayment of the GSIs, it remains uncertain whether adverse conditions of the Portuguese
economy could impact the Bank's profitability and ability to generate income, jeopardising the Bank's
ability to preserve capital. The rating agencies also consider the following additional risk factors: (i)
the declining quality of the loan portfolio and any exposure to small and medium enterprises ("SME")
in Portugal; (ii) the Bank's exposure to public debt; (iii) the Bank's exposure to its main clients,
particularly shareholders (0.9% of BCP's shareholders were also clients of BCP as at 31 December
2019); and (iv) continued resort to funding from the ECB.

Rating agencies have been recently revising the ratings of the European banks in different geographies
due to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 outbreak and a reassessment of the Portuguese market
by some rating agencies was already done. There is no guarantee that further rating actions or outlook
revisions will not be made in the future.

Any downgrade in the Bank's ratings may contribute to the erosion of the collateral eligible for funding
by the ECB, as well as more restrictive access to funding and increased funding costs. Under such
circumstances, the Bank may need to reinitiate its deleveraging process and reduce its activities, which
could have a negative impact on the Bank's ratings. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse
effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_The Portuguese Republic is regularly subject to rating reviews by the rating agencies, which could_**
**_affect the funding of the economy and the Bank's activity._**

The rating agencies S&P, Moody's, Fitch Ratings and DBRS have downgraded the long and short-term
ratings of the Portuguese Republic on several occasions since the beginning of the financial crisis due
to the uncertainties and risks of a prolonged recession, the outlook for modest GDP growth, high levels
of unemployment, limited fiscal flexibility, the high leverage of the private sector and the level of
sustainability of Portuguese public debt. The long term ratings of the Portuguese Republic as at the date
of this Offering Circular are as follows: Moody's (Baa3/Positive), S&P (BBB/Stable), Fitch Ratings
(BBB/Stable) and DBRS (BBB(high)/Stable).

Portuguese Republic credit ratings represent an important component condition to the Bank's own credit
ratings given the connection between the rating of the sovereign and the rating of banking institutions
in the rating agencies methodologies.

Any downgrade in the Portuguese Republic's ratings may contribute to the erosion of the collateral
eligible for funding by the ECB, as well as more restrictive access to funding and increased funding
costs, would worsen the economy's funding conditions and would have a negative effect on the Bank's
credit risk and consequently on its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_The Bank faces exposure to risks in its businesses in Europe (Poland) and Africa (Angola and_**
**_Mozambique)._**

The Bank faces exposure to risks in its operations in Poland and Mozambique, as well as a result of its
equity accounted holding in Angola via Banco Millennium Angola, S.A. ("BMA"), whose

materialisation in the future may have an adverse impact on the business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects of the Bank.

In 2019, the Bank's net profit (after income taxes and non-controlling interests) attributable to
international operations was EUR 143.8 million, compared to net profits (after income taxes and noncontrolling interests) of a total EUR 302.0 million for the Bank as a whole. For the same period, net
income in Poland was EUR 130.5 million, (EUR 65.4 million of which was attributable to the Bank),
net contribution in Angola was EUR 2.5 million and net income in Mozambique was EUR 99.5 million
(of which EUR 66.3 million was attributable to the Bank).

_Poland_

There is the risk that the implementation of more economic policy decisions, namely on the tax front,
targeting the banking system by Polish authorities could negatively affect investors' confidence and the
economic activity and, consequently, negatively impact the profitability of the Polish banking sector.

The removal of the peg of the EUR/CHF parity led to a significant appreciation of the Swiss franc
("CHF") against the euro and the zloty. The granting of loans in Swiss francs was a common practice
of most Polish banks (and in other economies of Central and Eastern Europe) in the past. Bank
Millennium granted mortgage loans in Swiss Francs until December 2008 and its Swiss francs mortgage
loans portfolio on 31 December 2019 stood at approximately EUR 3.3 billion (approximately 20.1% of
the total loan portfolio in Poland). The mortgage loans impaired ratio (stage 3) stood at 4.6% in 2019
which compares to 4.4% in 2018.

According to the Polish Bank Association (ZBP), during 2019, over 70% of the lawsuits regarding FXindexed mortgage loans obtained a final verdict favourable to the banks involved. However, after the
CJEU judgment regarding Case C-260/18 issued on 3 October 2019, there is a risk that this so far
positive scenario for the banks may change. See the risk factor "The Bank is exposed to risks related
_to FX-indexed mortgage loans" for further information._

_Emerging Markets_

Angola and Mozambique present specific political, economic, fiscal, legal, regulatory and social risks
that differ from those found in countries with European economic and political systems, including, but
not limited to, those related to political and social environments, different business practices, logistical
challenges, shortages of skilled labour, trade restrictions, macroeconomic imbalances and security
challenges, which may negatively affect the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations
and prospects.

The Group's operations are currently exposed in particular to the political and economic conditions of
Angola and Mozambique. These conditions also relate to the fact that structural improvements are still
needed in many sectors in these markets, including transportation, energy, agriculture and mineral
sectors, as well as land, social and fiscal reforms. Some of these markets may also suffer from
geopolitical conflict, while a number of African states have unresolved political differences internally,
regionally and/or internationally.

The Bank's operations in Mozambique and Angola markets may involve protracted negotiations with
host governments, companies or other local entities and may be subject to instability arising from
political, economic, military or legal disturbances. Both Mozambique and Angola impose certain
restrictions due primarily to exchange policy controls and capital flows to and from other jurisdictions
are likewise subject to such controls and restrictions. Therefore, the ability to transfer U.S. dollars and
euro directly from local banks, including the repatriation of profits, is subject to official vetting.

Transfers above a threshold amount may require government approval, which may not be obtained or
may be subject to delays.

Regarding BIM – Banco Internacional de Moçambique, S.A. (“Millennium bim"), in Mozambique,
the dividends paid out to the Group in 2019 totalled EUR 29.8 million, while in Angolan no dividends
were paid to the Group in 2019.

Any reduction in profits or increase in the responsibilities associated with the Bank's international
operations may have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations
and prospects of the Bank.

_Mozambique_

According to an IMF statement dated 23 April 2016, existing debt guaranteed by the State of
Mozambique in an amount over USD 1 billion that had not been disclosed to the IMF. Following this
disclosure, the economic program supported by the IMF was suspended. According to an IMF
statement dated 13 December 2016, discussions were initiated on a possible new agreement with the
Government of Mozambique and the terms of reference for an external audit were agreed.

In June 2017, the Attorney General's Office of the Republic of Mozambique published an Executive
Summary regarding the abovementioned external audit. On 24 June 2017, the IMF released in a
statement that due to the existence of information gaps in this audit, an IMF mission would visit the
country to discuss audit results and possible follow-up measures. Following this visit, the IMF
requested the Government of Mozambique to obtain additional information on the use of the funds.

On 14 December 2017, in a statement from the IMF staff, after the end of the mission held between 30
November and 13 December 2017, it was reiterated the need for the Mozambican State to provide
missing information. In the statement of the Mozambican Attorney General's Office dated 29 January
2018, it is mentioned, among other things, that the Public Prosecutor submitted to the Administrative
Court, on 26 January 2018, a complaint regarding the financial responsibility of public managers and
companies participated by the State, participants in the execution and management of contracts for
financing, supplying and providing services related to debts not disclosed to the IMF.

As at 31 December 2019, Millennium bim's exposure to the State of Mozambique classified as Financial
assets measured at amortised cost – Debt Instruments amount to EUR 702 million and Financial assets
at fair value through other comprehensive income in the gross amount of EUR 80.1. These public debt
securities mostly have a maturity of less than one year. As at 31 December 2019, the Group has also
registered in the balance Loans and advances to customers, a direct gross exposure to the Mozambican
State in the amount of EUR 327.9 million (of which EUR 327.2 million are denominated in metical and
EUR 0.7 million denominated in USD) and an indirect exposure resulting from sovereign guarantees
received in the amount of EUR 162.6 million denominated in USD and in the balance Guarantees
granted and irrevocable commitments, an amount of EUR 62.1 million (of which EUR 1.2 million are
denominated in euro, EUR 2.0 million are denominated in metical, EUR 58.7 million denominated in
USD and EUR 0.1 million denominated in Rands).

As at 31 December 2019, considering the 66.7% indirect investment in Millennium bim, the Group's
interest in Millennium bim's equity amounted to EUR 355 million, with the exchange translation reserve
associated with this participation, accounted in Group's consolidated equity, a negative amount of
EUR 151 million. Millennium bim's contribution to consolidated net income in 2019, attributable to
the shareholders of the Bank, amounts to EUR 66.3 million.

Any of the foregoing may negatively affect the Bank's business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

-----

_Angola_

Angola's new government, which was elected in August 2017, has been taking important policy actions
aimed at mitigating the impact of the oil price shock, restore macroeconomic stability and pave the way
for sustainable growth, namely by enacting strategies conducive to a more diversified economic
structure, to the safety of the banking system and to a more flexible exchange rate regime. On request
of Angolan government, on 7 December 2018, the IMF approved a three-year program to support
Angola's economic reform program (IMF, Press Release No. 18/463), which amounts to USD 3.7
billion.

Any material relapse in the price of oil/or any slippages in the implementation of the structural reforms
and measures agreed with the IMF under the economic reform programme could lead to a worsening
of its economic and financial conditions and derail the gradual recovery projections. Any of the
foregoing may negatively affect the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

**_The Bank's highly liquid assets may not cover liabilities to its customer base._**

The Bank's main source of funding is its customer deposits (93% of the Bank's funding as at 31
December 2019). However, the persistence of interest rates at historically low levels (that are negative
in some cases) over the past few years has resulted in the Bank investing deposits into instruments with
higher potential yield. The Bank's other possible funding sources include money market instruments,
medium and long term bonds, covered bonds, commercial paper, medium term structured products and
the securitisation of its loan portfolio. The Bank has increasingly strengthened its own funds through
capital increases (the most recent ones, amounting to EUR 1.33 billion and EUR 174.6 million through
the Rights Offering and the private placement of 157,437,395 new shares, subscribed by Chiado, an
affiliate of Fosun, completed in February 2017 and November 2016 respectively, following the capital
increase amounting to EUR 481.2 million as a result of the public offer of securities, completed in June
2015, the share capital increases in cash of EUR 2.25 billion completed in July 2014 and the share
capital increase of EUR 500 million completed in October 2012) and the June 2012 GSIs of EUR 3
billion (which GSIs have, as of 9 February 2017, been repaid in full).

The Bank's LCR and the NSFR recorded as at 31 December 2019 were 216% and 135%, respectively,
compared to a regulatory requirement of 100% (fully implemented) for both ratios. The leverage ratio
stood at 7.0% (fully implemented) as at 31 December 2019, compared to a reference value of 3% (fully
implemented).

In case the Bank is unable to maintain its buffer of liquid assets, its ability to repay its liabilities will be
limited, which may represent a substantial adverse effect in its business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

**_The results of additional stress tests could result in a need to increase capital or a loss of public_**
**_confidence in the Group._**

National and international regulators, including the IMF, the ECB and the EBA, have been conducting
stress tests on the banking sector. In an EU-wide stress test conducted by the EBA in 2018, the Bank's
capital depletion under the hypothetical adverse scenario used was below the average suffered by the
48 major European banks that were tested directly by the EBA (-300 basis points of CET1 capital,
versus an average depletion of -395 basis points for the EBA banks).

The disclosure of the results of these stress tests may also result in a reduction in confidence in a
particular bank or the banking system as a whole. The Bank cannot exclude the need for additional
provisions for impairments. Consequently, new stress tests could adversely affect the cost of funding

for the Bank and have a materially adverse impact on its business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

As a consequence of SREP, excluding P2G, the minimum Group CET1 phased-in ratio required is
9.813% (4.5% Pillar 1, 2.25% Pillar 2 requirements, 2.5% CBR and 0.563% O-SIFI), the Group Tier 1
ratio is 11.313% and the Group total capital ratio is 13.313% from 31 December 2019. The Group's
CET1 ratio as at 31 December 2019 was 12.2% (fully implemented).

SREP may increase and an additional cushion may be requested. In addition, Polish SREP requirements
for 2020 are as follows: CET1 phased-in ratio required is 12.73%, the Tier 1 is 15.15% and the total
capital ratio is 18.37% from 1 January 2020. Bank Millennium's CET1, Tier 1 and total capital ratios
as at 31 December 2019 were 16.9%, 16.9% and 20.1%, respectively. See further "Recent developments
_on the banking regulation -_ _Response to COVID-19 crisis" below._

**_The coverage of pension fund liabilities could be insufficient, which would require an increase in_**
**_contributions, and the computation of additional actuarial losses could be influenced by changes to_**
**_assumptions._**

The Bank has undertaken the obligation to pay pensions to its employees upon retirement or due to
disability and other obligations, in accordance with the terms established in the Collective Labour
Agreement of the Banking Sector. The Bank's liabilities are primarily covered by the pension fund,
which is managed by Ocidental-Sociedade Gestora de Fundos de Pensões, S.A. The total number of
the pension fund participants was 27,557 as at 31 December 2019 and 27,381 as at 31 December 2018.

The liabilities related to retirement pensions and other employee benefits were wholly funded at levels
above the minimum limits defined by Banco de Portugal, presenting a coverage level of 100% at the
end of December 2019 (100% as at 31 December 2018). As at 31 December 2019, the liabilities related
to the pension fund and other employee benefits reached EUR 3,490 million, compared with EUR 3,066
million recorded as at 31 December 2018. In 2019, the pension fund recorded a positive 8.1% rate of
return, whereas in 2018 it stood at positive 0.2%.

Regulation (EU) No. 475/2012, of 5 June 2012, as amended, which amended IAS 19, eliminated the
option to defer the recognition of gains and losses, which is known as the corridor method.

The level of coverage of pension fund liabilities could turn out to be insufficient. If the deterioration of
global financial markets leads to lower investment income and, consequently, a lower value of the fund,
this would result in actuarial losses for the year, which would be recognised against reserves in the
financial year in which they were recorded. As at 31 December 2018, the Bank used a discount rate of
2.1% to measure its liability for the defined benefit pension plans of its employees and managers,
equivalent to the rate used in its accounts as at 31 December 2017. In the financial statements with
reference to 31 December 2019, the discount rate was at 1.4% and the pension growth rate 0% until
2019 and 0.5% after 2019. The Bank shall re-evaluate the adequacy of its actuarial assumptions for the
calculation of its liabilities with pensions on a semi-annual basis. A decrease in level of the interest
rates for the liabilities liquidation deadline or an increase in the pensions growth rate would imply a
decrease in the Bank's own capital. A decrease of 25 bps in the discount rate results in a decrease of
around EUR 146 million in the Bank's own capital, excluding the tax effect. An increase of 25 bps in
the pensions' growth rate results implies a reduction of around EUR 138 million in the Bank's own
capital, excluding the tax effect.

Actuarial gains and losses resulting from the differences between the assumptions used and actual
values (experience gains and losses) and the changes in the actuarial assumptions are recognised against
shareholder equity. In 2019, actuarial differences were recorded representing negative EUR 285 million
(negative EUR 98 million as at 31 December 2018). If there are shortfalls in the pension fund's rate of

58


-----

return, the Bank may have to increase its contributions, which would have an impact on the Bank's
regulatory capital ratios. The Bank cannot guarantee that changes will not take place in the actuarial
assumptions relating to the pension obligations and other employee benefits. Any changes in the
assumptions could lead to additional actuarial losses which could have a material adverse effect on the
Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Finally, the value of assets that are part of the pension fund depends on the future evolution of capital
markets and of the real estate market, both of which could be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and
heightened uncertainty about the magnitude and duration of the outbreak.

A decline in the capital markets and of the real estate market could cause the value of the portfolio's
assets to become insufficient to cover the liabilities assumed by the pension fund, adversely affecting
capital ratios and the Bank's business, financial condition, own capital and prospects.

**_The Bank may not be able to generate income to recover deferred taxes. Potential dilution of the_**
**_shareholders' position may result from the conversion into capital of a potential special reserve that_**
**_may have to be established according to the applicable legal framework, in particular in the case of_**
**_negative net individual results. Changes in the law or a different interpretation of the relevant_**
**_provisions of law may have an adverse impact on the capital ratio._**

The Bank's deferred tax assets ("DTAs") (on a consolidated basis) as at 31 December 2019
corresponded to EUR 2,721 million, compared to EUR 2,917 million as at 31 December 2018, and were
generated by tax losses and temporary differences. The most notable sources of the Bank's DTAs nondependent on future profitability are impairment losses amounting to EUR 983 million and related
employee benefits amounting to EUR 837 million.

Deferred taxes are calculated on the basis of the tax rates which are expected to be applicable at the
time of the reversal of the temporary differences, which correspond to the approved or substantially
approved rates at the time of the balance sheet. Assets and liabilities for deferred taxes are presented
for their net value when, pursuant to the applicable laws, current tax assets may be compensated with
current tax liabilities and when the deferred taxes relate to the same tax.

If the Bank is not able to generate enough taxable income to enable the absorption of the tax losses
carry forward and the temporary differences deductible for tax purposes, the deferred taxes may not be
recovered.

Additionally, the Bank may be forced to alter its evaluation as a result of corrections to the taxable
income or to tax losses that it may be subject to or as a result of reductions of the tax rates.

The recoverability of DTAs depends on the implementation of the strategy of the Bank's Board of
Directors, namely the generation of estimated taxable income and its interpretation of tax legislation.
Any changes in the assumptions used in estimating future profits or tax legislation may have material
impacts on deferred tax assets.

The assessment of the recoverability of DTAs was carried based on the respective financial statements
prepared under the budget process for 2020 and adjusted according to the strategic plan approved by
the elected governing bodies, which support future taxable income, considering the macroeconomic and
competitive environment.

To estimate taxable profits for 2020 and subsequent periods, the following main assumptions were
considered:

59


-----

The approximation between accounting and tax rules foreseen by Law No. 98/2019, of 4 September
2019, was considered, assuming the Group will not exercise its application earlier than the adaptation
period of 5 years that the abovementioned Law foresees. In the application of these rules, the following
assumptions were considered, in general terms:

a) non-deductible expenses related to increase of credit impairments for the years between
2020 to 2023 were estimated based on the average percentage of non-deducted amounts
for tax purposes in the last accounting years between 2016 to 2019, compared to the
amounts of net impairment increases recorded in these years;

b) the expenses with credit impairment's increases beginning in 2024 were considered
deductible for tax purposes according to the new fiscal regime;

c) impairment reversals not accepted for tax purposes were estimated based on the
Reduction Plan of Non-Performing Assets 2019-2021 submitted to the supervisory
authority in March 2019, and also on the average reversal percentage observed in the
last years of 2016 to 2019;

d) the referred average percentages were calculated separately, according to the presence
or not of a mortgage security, the eligibility for the special regime applicable to deferred
tax assets and according to the clients' rating as Non-Performing Exposures;

The deductions related to impairment of financial assets were projected based on the destination (sale
or settlement) and the estimated date of the respective operations;

The deductions related to employee benefits were projected based on their estimated payments or
deduction plans, in accordance with information provided by the actuary of the pension fund.

The projections made consider the Group's strategic priorities, essentially reflecting the projection of
the Bank's medium-term business in Portugal in terms of results generation, and are globally consistent
with the Reduction Plan of Non-Performing Assets 2019-2021, submitted to the supervisory authority
in March 2019, emphasising:

improvement in the net margin, reflecting an effort to increase credit, favouring certain segments, the
focus on off-balance sheet resources while interest rates remain negative and the effect of the
normalisation of those rates in the last years of the projection horizon, such as results from the market
interest rate curve;

increase in commission income based on efficient and judicious management of commissioning and
pricing, and, regarding the Individuals segment, the growth of off-balance sheet products;

normalisation of the cost of risk to levels aligned with the current activity of the Bank and reduction of
negative impacts produced by the devaluation or sale of noncurrent assets, with the progressive
reduction of the historical NPE, foreclosed assets and FREs (corporate restructuring funds) portfolios;

capturing efficiency gains enhanced by digitalisation, reflected in the control of operating costs, but
implying in the short term an effort to adapt the Bank's structure.

Following the analysis of the recoverability of deferred tax assets carried out in 2019, the Bank
derecognized an amount net of deferred tax assets in the amount of EUR 116,347,000. From the
referred net amount, EUR 69,584,000 were recorded against results and EUR 46,763,000 were recorded
against reserves. The allocation of deferred taxes to results and reserves was made in accordance with
the accounting principle used for the recognition of the deferred tax assets in question, due to the
decomposition of the realities that originated the tax losses to which they refer.

60


-----

The performed analysis allowed the conclusion of total recoverability of the deferred tax assets
recognized as at 31 December 2019. The potential effects of COVID-19 were not taken into
consideration within the analysis performed.

As mentioned previously, for the estimation of the Bank's taxable income until 2023, it was considered
the maintenance of the tax rules in force until 2018, resulting from not exercising earlier the option of
applying the new regime. Regardless the previously referred option, the new regime's application will
be mandatory in the financial years of 2022 and/or 2023 in the following circumstances:

In the financial year of 2022, if, since 1 January 2022, the Bank distributes dividends regarding that
financial year or acquires own shares, without occurring a decrease of the DTAs covered by the optional
framework foreseen in Law No. 61/2014, of 26 August 2014 (as amended by Law 23/2016, the "Law
**61/2014") in, at least, 10% comparatively to the amount recorded on 31 December 2018;**

In the financial year of 2023, if, since 1 January 2023, the Bank distributes dividends regarding that
financial year or acquires own shares, without occurring a decrease of the DTAs covered by Law
61/2014's optional framework in, at least, 20% comparatively to the amount recorded on 31 December
2018. It was assumed that the Bank will not exercise its early application over the adaptation period of
5 years. Meanwhile, on 4 September 2019, Law 98/2019 was published, enacting the tax regime
described above.

Law 61/2014 approved an optional framework, with the possibility of subsequent waiver, according to
which, upon certain events (including (a) annual net losses on the separate financial statements, as well
as (b) liquidation as a result of voluntary dissolution, insolvency decided by the court or withdrawal of
the respective authorisation), the DTAs that have resulted from the non-deduction of expenses and of
negative asset variations resulting from impairment losses in credits and from post-employment benefits
or long-term employments, will be converted into tax credits. In the case of (a), a special reserve must
be created in the amount of the tax credit resulting from the terms of such Law, enhanced with an
increase of 10%, which is intended exclusively to be incorporated into the share capital. The creation
of such special reserve implies a creation, simultaneously, of conversion rights and of a right to demand
the issue of shares by the Bank in an amount equivalent to such special reserve granted to the Portuguese
Republic ("State Rights"), such rights being acquirable by the shareholders through payment to the
Portuguese State of the same amount. The tax credits can be offset against tax debts of the beneficiaries
(or of any entity with head office in Portugal within the same group to which the special regime foreseen
in the Corporate Tax Code is applicable or within the same prudential consolidation perimeter for the
purpose of Regulation (EU) no. 575/2013, of the European Parliament and of the Council, as amended)
or reimbursed by the Portuguese Republic. Due to this framework, the recovery of the DTAs covered
by Law 61/2014's optional framework is not dependent on future profitability.

Law 23/2016, of 19 August, limited the scope of the regime, determining that tax assets originated in
expenses or negative asset variations accounted for after 1 January 2016 are not eligible for the optional
framework. The framework set out in Law 61/2014 was further developed by (a) Ministerial Order
("Portaria") 259/2016, of 4 October 2016, on the control and use of the tax credit and (b) Ministerial
Order ("Portaria") 293-A/2016, of 18 November 2016 (as amended by Ministerial Order ("Portaria")
60/2020, of 5 March 2020), concerning the conditions and proceedings for the acquisition by
shareholders of the referred State Rights. Law 98/2019, of 4 September, established a three year
deadline for the acquisition of the referred State rights by the shareholders, after which the Board of
Directors of the issuing bank is obliged to promote the record of the share capital increase by the amount
resulting from the exercise of the conversion rights. According to this legislation, among other aspects,
such rights are subject to an acquisition right by the shareholders on the date of their creation exercisable
in periods to be established by the Board of Directors until three years after the date of the confirmation
date of the tax credit resulting from the conversion of the deferred tax assets by the Portuguese Tax
Authorities. The issuing bank has to deposit in the name of the Portuguese State the amount of the price

corresponding to the exercise of the acquisition right of all the conversion rights, within three months
beginning from the confirmation date of the deferred tax assets into tax credit, ahead and independently
of their acquisition. Such deposit is redeemed when and to the extent that the State Rights are acquired
by shareholders or are exercised by the State.

As disclosed in due course, pursuant to the General Meeting held on 15 October 2014, the Bank adopted
the optional framework approved by Law 61/2014 described above. The Group's CET1 ratio, fully
implemented as at 31 December 2019, corresponds to 12.2% and already incorporates the effects of the
application of the new framework which became effective on 1 January 2015.

The Bank's net result (on an individual basis) as at 31 December 2019 was EUR 139 million; there is
no guarantee that the net result in the following years will be positive.

If the Bank registers a net loss as at the end of a financial year, on an individual basis, then, under the
provisions of Law 61/2014, the Portuguese Republic will be granted State Rights, exercisable after the
mentioned period of up to 3 years, during which shareholders will have the opportunity to acquire such
conversion rights from the State. If shares are finally issued pursuant to the exercise of such conversion
rights, this would dilute the remaining shareholders of the Bank. Among other factors that may affect
the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and their composition regarding the deferred tax assets that
fall within the scope of Law 61/2014, the interpretation of the tax law is relevant, as well as the
performance of several operations in 2017, 2018 and 2019.

In the 2015 and 2016 financial years, the Bank registered deferred tax assets regarding expenses and
negative asset variations with post-employment or long term employment benefits and credit
impairment losses accounted for up to 31 December 2014, which assets the Bank deems eligible for the
purposes of the framework approved by Law 61/2014. A change in law or a different interpretation of
the law, or the non-performance of the abovementioned operations could have an adverse impact on the
Bank's capital ratio.

Any of the aforementioned could result in a material adverse effect on the Bank's business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.

The Bank applied IFRS 9 in the period beginning on 1 January 2018. Since no specific tax treatment
was established regarding the transition adjustment to IFRS 9, the Bank considered the application of
the Corporate Income Tax general rules. Any new transitional regime established for those purposes
or different interpretation on the tax treatment of the adoption of IFRS 9 could result in a material
adverse effect on the recovery of deferred taxes.

**_The Bank's ability to achieve certain targets is dependent upon certain assumptions involving factors_**
**_that are significantly or entirely beyond the Bank's control and are subject to known and unknown_**
**_risks, uncertainties and other factors._**

The achievement of the Bank's internal targets will depend on the verification of assumptions involving
factors that are significantly or entirely beyond the Bank's control and subject to known and unknown
risks, uncertainties and other factors that may result in management failing to achieve these targets.
These factors include those described elsewhere in this section and, in particular:

  - the Bank's ability to successfully implement its strategy;

  - the Bank's ability to successfully implement its funding and capital plans;

  - the successful implementation of economic reforms in Portugal;

62


-----

  - the Bank's ability to access funding in the capital markets;

  - the level of the Bank's LLRs against NPEs;

  - the Bank's ability to reduce NPEs;

  - the quality of the Bank's assets;

  - the Bank's ability to reduce costs;

  - the financial condition of the Bank's customers;

  - reductions to the Bank's ratings;

  - growth of the financial markets in the countries in which the Bank operates;

  - the Bank's ability to grow internationally;

  - future market conditions;

  - currency fluctuations;

  - the actions of regulators;

  - changes to the political, social and regulatory framework in which the Bank operates;

  - macroeconomic or technological trends or conditions, including inflation and consumer
confidence,

and other risk factors identified in this Offering Circular. If one or more of these assumptions is
inaccurate, the Bank may be unable to achieve one or more of its targets, which may have a material
adverse effect on the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

The Bank regularly uses financial models in the course of its operations. These financial models help
inform the Bank of the value of certain of its assets (such as certain loans, financial instruments,
including illiquid financial instruments where market prices are not readily available, goodwill or other
intangible assets) and liabilities (such as the Bank's defined benefit obligations and provisioning) as
well as the Bank's risk exposure. These financial models also generally require the Bank to make
assumptions, judgements and estimates which, in many cases, are inherently uncertain, including
expected cash flows, the ability of borrowers to service debt, residential and commercial property price
appreciation and depreciation, and relative levels of defaults. Such assumptions, judgements and
estimates may need to be updated to reflect changing facts, trends and market conditions and may result
in a decrease in the value of, and consequently an impairment of, the Bank's assets, an increase in the
Bank's liabilities or an increase in the Bank's risk exposure, any of which may have a material adverse
effect on the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Property prices
in Portugal have remained largely flat since 2000, particularly in comparison to property prices in Spain.

In particular, recent historic market volatility and illiquidity has challenged the factual bases of certain
underlying assumptions and made it difficult to value some of the Bank's financial instruments.
Decreased valuations reflecting prevailing market conditions, faulty assumptions or illiquidity, may
result in changes in the fair values of these instruments, which may have a material adverse effect on
the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_The Bank is exposed to reputational risks, including those arising from rumours that affect its image_**
**_and customer relations._**

Reputational risk is inherent to the Bank's business activity. Negative public opinion towards the Bank
or the financial services sector as a whole could result from real or perceived practices in the banking
sector, such as money laundering, terrorism financing, the fraudulent sale of financial products or breach
of competition rules, or a departure from the way that the Group conducts, or is perceived to conduct,
its business. Negative publicity and negative public opinion, particularly in relation to pending
litigation or enquiries by regulators that could be resolved against the Bank's favour, could adversely
affect the Bank's ability to maintain and attract customers and counterparties, the loss of which could
adversely affect the Bank's business, financial condition and future prospects, due, for instance, to a run
on deposits and subsequent lack of funding sources.

The Bank may be unable to detect money laundering, terrorism financing, tax evasion or tax avoidance
behaviour by clients, which could be attributed to the Bank. Failure to manage such risk could lead to
reputational damage and to financial penalties for failure to comply with required legal procedures or
other aspects of applicable laws and regulations, which could materially adversely affect the Bank's
business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

The Bank has a limited number of customers who are classified as politically exposed persons pursuant
to the applicable legislation, including Law No. 83/2017, of 18 August 2017, as amended, and
regulatory notices ("Avisos") No. 5/2013, of 18 December 2013, or No. 2/2018, of 26 September 2018,
of Banco de Portugal (as applicable), as amended. Although the Bank exercises increasingly stricter
scrutiny of transactions with politically exposed persons in order to ensure compliance with applicable
laws, the services provided to these individuals may expose the Bank to reputational risks,
notwithstanding the Bank's compliance with applicable laws.

**_Labour disputes or other industrial actions could disrupt Bank operations or make them more costly_**
**_to run._**

The Bank is exposed to the risk of labour disputes and other industrial actions. 82.2% of the Bank's
employees in Portugal and 76.9% of all its employees were members of labour unions at the end of
2019 and the Bank may experience strikes, work stoppages or other industrial actions in the future. Any
of these actions could, possibly for a significant period of time, result in disruption to the Bank's activity
and increased salaries and benefits granted to employees or otherwise have a material adverse effect on
the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_The Bank is exposed to market risk, which could result in the devaluation of investment holdings or_**
**_affect its trading results._**

The performance of the financial markets could cause changes in the value of the Bank's investment
and trading portfolios. Changes in the interest rate level, yield curve and spreads could reduce the
Bank's net interest margin. Changes in foreign exchange rates could affect the value of its assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and could affect the results of trading.

The Bank has significant exposure to participation units in closed-end funds. See further "The Bank
_holds units issued by specialised credit recovery closed-end funds that are subject to potential_
_depreciation, for which reimbursement may not be requested and for which there is no secondary_
_market". As from 1 January 2018, following the implementation of the IFRS 9, the participation units_
started to be recorded at fair value through profit and loss. See further "The Bank is subject to changes
_in financial reporting standards, such as IFRS 9 and IFRS 16, or policies, including as a result of_
_choices made by the Bank, which could materially and adversely affect the Bank's reported results of_

64


-----

_operations and financial condition and may have a corresponding material adverse impact on capital_
_ratios"._

The Bank has implemented risk management methods to mitigate and control these and other market
risks to which it is exposed, including the use of derivatives to hedge certain products offered to its
customers, and the Bank's risk exposure is continuously monitored. However, it is difficult to accurately
predict changes in market conditions and to foresee the effects that these changes might have on the
Bank's financial condition and results of operations. Any failure in risk management or control policies
targeting market risk could have a negative impact on the Bank's business, financial condition, results
of operations and prospects.

**_The Bank is subject to certain operational risks, which may include interruptions in the services_**
**_provided, errors, fraud attributable to third parties, omissions and delays in the provision of services_**
**_and implementation of requirements for risk management._**

In its normal activity and as a result of its organisational structure, the Bank is subject to certain
operational risks, including interruptions in the services provided, errors, fraud attributable to third
parties, and omissions and delays in the provision of services and implementation of requirements for
risk management. A majority of the Bank's operational losses in 2019 were caused by frauds and
execution failures and a large portion of the operational losses had low material significance, under
EUR 100,000 (94% of all operational losses Group wide). In fact about 56.2% of the cases recorded in
2019 had a financial impact of less than EUR 5,000 each. The Bank continually monitors operational
risks by means of, among other actions, advanced administrative and information systems and insurance
coverage with respect to certain operational risks. However, it is not possible to guarantee that the
monitoring and prevention of these risks will be fully effective. Any lack of success in the
implementation of the Bank's risk management and control policies could have a material adverse effect
on its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_The Bank faces technological risks, and a failure in the Bank's information technology systems could_**
**_result in, among other things, trading losses, losses in customer deposits and investments, accounting_**
**_and financial reporting errors and breaches in data security._**

The operations developed by the Group, in Portugal and internationally, have an infrastructure of
information systems that is externalised, but also common and integrated, promoting higher overall
efficiency. The Bank's operations depend heavily on their respective computer processing capabilities,
especially following the centralisation of the information systems. Computer processing capabilities
include record-keeping, financial reporting and other systems, including systems for monitoring points
of sale and internal accounting systems. In March 2013, the Bank renewed the outsourcing agreement
with IBM, which includes the management of computer infrastructures—central system, department
systems and server farm for systems—some specific areas of application development and IT support
services to the Bank's organic units.

Regarding the security of the information systems, the Bank has continued to pursue a strategy aligned
with good international practices. However, it is not possible to guarantee to potential investors
complete identification and timely correction of all problems related to the informational technology
systems, or systematic success in the implementation of technological improvements. A failure in the
Bank's information technology systems could result in, among other things, trading losses, losses in
customer deposits and investments, accounting and financial reporting errors and breaches in data
security. The occurrence of any of the aforementioned events could have a significant and negative
effect on the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_The Bank is subject to the risk of changes in the relationship with its partners._**

Some of the Bank's activities are carried out in partnership with other entities that are not under the
control of the Bank, including Millenniumbcp Ageas. Therefore, the Bank does not have the ability to
control the decisions of these entities or ensure full compliance with the agreements that established
such partnerships. Any decision or action by these entities and/or their breach of such agreements may
have a material adverse effect on the Bank's reputation, business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects. For further details on the Bank's strategic partnerships, please see
"Description of the Business of the Group"

**_Transactions in the Bank's own portfolio involve risks._**

The Bank carries out various proprietary treasury activities, including the placement of deposits
denominated in Euro and other currencies in the interbank market, as well as trading in primary and
secondary markets for government securities. The management of the Bank's own portfolio includes
taking positions in fixed income and equity markets, both via spot market and through derivative
products and other financial instruments. In spite of the Bank's limited level of involvement in these
activities, trading on account of its own portfolio carries risks, since its results depend partly on market
conditions. A reduction in the value of financial assets held due primarily to market conditions, or any
other such conditions outside the control of the Bank, could require a corresponding loss recognition
that may impact the Bank's balance sheet. Moreover, the Bank relies on a vast range of risk reporting
and internal management tools in order to be able to report its exposure to such transactions correctly
and in due time. Future results arising from trading on account of its own portfolio will depend partly
on market conditions, and the Bank may incur significant losses resulting from adverse changes in the
fair value of financial assets, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_Hedging operations carried out by the Bank may not be adequate to prevent losses._**

The Bank carries out hedging transactions to reduce its exposure to different types of risks associated
with its business. Many of its hedging strategies are based on historical patterns of transactions and
correlations. Consequently, unexpected market developments might negatively affect the Bank's
hedging strategies.

Furthermore, the Bank does not hedge all of its risk exposure in all market environments or against all
types of risks and in some cases a hedge may not be available to the Bank. Moreover, the way that
gains or losses arising from certain ineffective hedges are recognised may result in additional volatility
in its reported earnings. The Group employs derivatives and other financial instruments to hedge its
exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk resulting from financing and investment activities.
Hedging derivatives are recognised at their fair value and the profits and losses resulting from their
valuation are recognised against the results. The Bank may still incur losses from changes in the fair
value of derivatives and other financial instruments that qualify as fair value hedges. If any of its
hedging instruments or strategies are inefficient, the Bank could incur losses which could have a
material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_The Bank faces exchange rate risk related to its international operations._**

All of the Bank's international operations are directly or indirectly exposed to exchange rate risk, which
could adversely affect the Bank's results. Any devaluation of these currencies relative to the Euro could
have a negative impact on the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

As at 31 December 2019, the loans-to-deposits ratio in Poland and Mozambique was 86% and 38%,
respectively. The Bank's loan portfolio also includes loans in foreign currency, where the losses are

66


-----

assumed by customers and recorded in the profit and loss account under impairment. The use of funding
in foreign currency in some countries of Eastern Europe exposes some of the Bank's customers to
exchange rate risk, affecting the financial condition of these entities and, consequently, the net income
of the Bank. Although Bank Millennium stopped granting new foreign currency loans in Poland by the
end of 2008, it still holds a considerable loan portfolio in foreign currency, mainly in Swiss francs (as
at 31 December 2019), 20.6% of the total loan portfolio in Poland and 40% of the total mortgage loan
book in Poland), and therefore the Bank's net income could be significantly affected by the need to
undertake additional payments for impairment in the loan portfolio and by the high cost of zloty swaps.
On 15 January 2015, the Swiss National Bank discontinued its minimum exchange rate which had been
set at EUR/CHF 1.20 in September 2011. Simultaneously, the Swiss National Bank lowered the interest
rate on sight deposit account balances that exceed a given exemption threshold by 0.5% to − 0.75%.
As a consequence, on the next day the Swiss franc appreciated 15% to around EUR/CHF 1.04 and the
main index on the Swiss stock exchange went down around 8.7%. The EUR/CHF exchange rate is now
free float. Net income may also be adversely affected if Poland does not join the Eurozone in the
medium term as is currently expected. Similarly, net income may be affected if institutional investors
pool their assets in established, rather than emerging, markets. This risk is exacerbated in the context
of greater political instability related to reform of the European institutional framework, which has
already had repercussions on the Swiss franc exchange rate.

For details on the Bank's exposure to risks in foreign countries, see risk factor "The Bank faces exposure
_to risks in its businesses in Europe (Poland) and Africa (Angola and Mozambique)"._

**_The Bank is subject to the risk of internal and external fraud, crime, cybercrime, or other types of_**
**_misconduct by employees or third parties which could have a material adverse effect on the Bank._**

The Bank is subject to the risk of fraud, crime, money laundering, cybercrime and other types of
misconduct by employees and third parties, as well as to unauthorised transactions by employees, third
party service providers and external staff, including "rogue trading". This type of risk could result in
breaches of law, rules, regulations and internal policies, losses, claims, fines, regulatory action, legal
proceedings or reputational damage.

In the area of payments, over the past years the Bank and especially the Bank's clients have been subject
to cybercrime and fraud in the form of phishing and malware. European law tends to hold the Bank
liable unless it provides proof of intentional misconduct or gross negligence by the client. Other forms
of theft include violent robberies of ATMs, in which criminals use combustible gas, explosives or
vehicles and heavy equipment to gain access to cash stored in ATMs.

The Bank may be subject to disruptions of its operating or information systems, arising from criminal
acts by individuals and groups via cyberspace, which may interrupt the service to clients.

The Bank remains potentially exposed to the risk that the procedures implemented and the measures
adopted with respect to the storage and processing of personal data relating to its customers may prove
to be inadequate and/or not in compliance with the laws and regulations in force from time to time
and/or may not be promptly or properly implemented by employees and associates, especially
considering the imminent entry into force of the GDPR. Thus, the data could be subject to damage,
loss, theft, disclosure or processing for purposes other than those authorised by the customers, or even
use by unauthorised parties (whether third parties or employees of companies of the Bank). If any of
these circumstances occur there could be a material adverse effect on the Bank's business, including its
reputation, financial condition, results of operation or prospects.

Failure of the Bank's information technology systems could lead to a breach of regulations and
(contractual) obligations and have a material adverse effect on the Bank's reputation, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects. The continuous efforts of individuals and groups,

67


-----

including organised crime, via cyberspace to commit fraud through electronic channels or to gain access
to information technology systems used by the Bank (including with respect to clients' and Bank
information held on those systems and transactions processed through these systems) are a growing
threat to the Bank. The manifestations of risks to technology—including cyber security—change
rapidly and require continued focus and investment. Given the increasing sophistication and scope of
potential attacks via cyberspace, it is possible that future attacks may lead to significant breaches of
security and loss of (personal) data. In addition, the Group may as a result not be able to access data or
operate its systems, it may not be able to recover data, or establishing that data is not compromised may
be very time consuming and costly.

There is a risk that cyber-security risk is not adequately managed or, even if adequately managed, a
cyber-attack can take place and be successful, which could lead to breach of regulations, investigations
and administrative enforcement by supervisory authorities and claims that may materially and adversely
affect the Bank's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition, prospects and its
position in legal proceedings.

**_A material decline in global capital markets and volatility in other markets could adversely affect the_**
**_activity, results and value of strategic investments of the Bank._**

Investment returns are an important part of the Bank's overall profitability, particularly in relation to
the life insurance business carried out by the Millennium bcp Ageas joint venture and the Bank's
investment banking business.

Uncertainty in global financial markets stemming from the price volatility of capital market instruments
may materially and adversely affect the Group and particularly the life insurance business and
investment banking operations, impacting its financial operations and other income and the value of its
financial holdings and securities portfolios.

In particular, a decline in the global capital markets could have an adverse effect on the sales of many
of the Group's products and services, such as unit-linked products, capitalisation insurance, real estate
investment funds, asset management services, brokerage, primary market issuances and investment
banking operations, and significantly reduce the fees related to them, as well as adversely affect the
Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. As a minority shareholder of
Millennium bcp Ageas, the Bank is at risk of being required to inject capital into the company if its
solvency ratio falls below a certain predefined level, which could occur if certain products of
Millennium bcp Ageas do not meet a minimum level of return. Furthermore, the prolonged fluctuation
of stock and bond market prices or extended volatility or turbulence of markets could lead to the
withdrawal of funds from markets by investors, which would result in lower investment rates or in the
early redemption of life policies. Any such decrease could negatively influence the placement of the
Bank's investment products. Therefore, a decline in the capital markets in general could adversely affect
the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

The Bank also maintains trading and investment positions in debt securities, foreign exchange, equity
and other markets. These positions could be adversely affected by volatility in financial and other
markets and in Portuguese sovereign debt (EUR 6.5 billion as at 31 December 2019, of which EUR 3
million recorded in "Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss – Held for trading"; EUR 31
million recorded in "Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss – Designated at fair value
through profit or loss"; EUR 6.3 billion recorded in "Financial assets at fair value through other
comprehensive income" and EUR 137 million recorded in “Financial assets at amortised cost – Debt
securities”), creating a risk of substantial losses. Potential gains in the Portuguese public debt in
December 2019 stand at around EUR 39.1 million. Volatility can also lead to losses relating to a broad
range of the other trading and hedging products that the Bank uses, including swaps, futures, options
and structured products. Significant reductions in estimated or actual values of the Bank's assets have

68


-----

occurred from previous events in the market. Continued volatility and further fragmentation of certain
financial markets may affect the Bank's business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.
In the future, these factors may have an influence on day-to-day valuations of the Bank's financial assets
and liabilities, recorded at fair value.

**_Acts of terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics and global conflicts may have a negative impact on_**
**_the Bank's business and operations._**

Acts of terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics, global conflicts or other similar catastrophic events
could have a negative impact on the Bank's business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects. Such events could damage the Bank's facilities, disrupt or delay the normal operations of its
business (including communications and technology), result in harm or cause travel limitations on the
Bank's employees, and have a similar impact on its clients and counterparties. These events could also
negatively impact the purchase of the Bank's products and services to the extent that those acts or
conflicts result in reduced capital markets activity, lower asset price levels, or disruptions in general
economic activity, or in financial market settlement functions. In addition, war, terror attacks, political
unrest, global conflicts, the national and global efforts to combat terrorism and other potential military
activities and outbreaks of hostilities may negatively impact economic growth, which could have an
adverse effect on the Bank's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects, besides
other adverse effects on the Bank in ways that it is unable to predict.

**_The Bank's risk management methods may not be able to identify all risks or level of risks to which_**
**_the Bank is exposed._**

The Bank's risk management methods are based on a combination of human and technical controls and
supervision, which are subject to errors and defects. Some of the Bank's methods of managing risks are
based on internally developed controls and on historic data on market behaviour, also supported by
common market practices. These methods might not adequately predict future losses, in particular when
related to relevant market fluctuations, which could be considerably higher than those observed in other
periods. These methods might also be ineffective in protecting against losses caused by technical errors,
if the implemented testing and control systems are not effective in the prevention of software and
hardware technical defects. Any errors or failures in the implementation of such risk management
systems, as well as their possible inability to identify all the risks or risk levels to which the Bank is
exposed, could have a material adverse effect on the Bank's business, financial condition, results of
operations and prospects.

**2.** **RISKS RELATING TO NOTES ISSUED UNDER THE PROGRAMME**

**2.1** **Risks relating to the Structure of a particular issue of Notes**

A wide range of Notes may be issued under the Programme. A number of these Notes may have features
which contain particular risks for potential investors. Set out below is a description of the most common
such features:

**_An investor in Subordinated Notes or Senior Non-Preferred Notes assumes an enhanced risk of loss_**
**_in the event of the Issuer's insolvency._**

The Issuer's obligations under Subordinated Notes will be unsecured and wholly subordinated to the
claims of (a) creditors of the Issuer whose claims are admitted to proof in the winding-up of the Issuer
and who are unsubordinated creditors of the Issuer, and (b) creditors of the Issuer whose claims are or
are expressed to be subordinated to the claims of other creditors of the Issuer (other than those whose
claims relate to obligations which constitute, or would, but for any applicable limitation on the amount
of such capital, constitute Tier 1 instruments or Tier 2 instruments of the Issuer, or whose claims

69


-----

otherwise rank or are expressed to rank _pari passu with, or junior to, the claims of holders of the_
Subordinated Notes); "Tier 1 instruments" has the meaning given to it by the Applicable Banking
Regulations from time to time; "Tier 2 instruments" has the meaning given to it by the Applicable
Banking Regulations from time to time; "Applicable Banking Regulations" means at any time the
laws, regulations, requirements, guidelines and policies relating to capital adequacy then in effect in
Portugal and applicable to the Issuer, including, without limitation to the generality of the foregoing,
those regulations, requirements, guidelines and policies relating to capital adequacy then in effect of the
Relevant Authority and/or any regulation, directive or other binding rules, standards or decisions
adopted by the institutions of the European Union; and "Relevant Authority" means Banco de
Portugal, the European Central Bank or such other authority (whether in Portugal or elsewhere) having
primary responsibility for prudential supervision of the Issuer. Although Subordinated Notes may pay
a higher rate of interest than comparable Notes which are not subordinated, there is a real risk that an
investor in Subordinated Notes will lose all or some of his investment should the Issuer become
insolvent or the Notes subject to loss absorption.

The Senior Non-Preferred Notes will constitute direct, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the
Issuer and the rights of the holders of any Senior Non-Preferred Notes will rank junior in priority of
payment to the claims of all unsubordinated creditors of the Issuer that are not creditors in respect of
Statutory Senior Non-Preferred Obligations. Accordingly, no payments of amounts due under the
Senior Non-Preferred Notes will be made to the Noteholders in the event of insolvency or winding up
of such Issuer (to the extent permitted by Portuguese law) except where all sums due from such Issuer
in respect of the claims of all unsubordinated creditors of the relevant Issuer that are not creditors in
respect of Statutory Senior Non-Preferred Obligations are paid in full, as more fully described in
Condition 2(c). "Statutory Senior Non-Preferred Obligations" means any present and future claims
in respect of unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer which have a lower ranking within
the meaning of article 8-A of Decree-Law no 199/2006 of 25 October (as amended) (or any other
provision implementing article 108 of Directive 2014/59/EU, as amended by Directive (EU) 2017/2399,
in Portugal) than the claims in respect of all other unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the
Issuer.

Although Senior Non-Preferred Notes may pay a higher rate of interest than comparable Notes which
benefit from a preferential ranking, there is a significant risk that an investor in Senior Non-Preferred
Notes will lose all or some of its investment should the Issuer become insolvent or the Notes subject to
loss absorption.

**_Notes may be subject to loss absorption on any application of the general bail-in tool or be subject to_**
**_other resolution tools and (in the case of Subordinated Notes) may be subject to loss absorption at_**
**_the point of non-viability of the Issuer._**

The BRRD contemplates that Subordinated Notes may be subject to non-viability loss absorption, in
addition to the application of the general bail-in tool which may apply to all Notes.

The powers provided to resolution authorities in the BRRD include write down/conversion powers to
ensure that capital instruments (including Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments) absorb losses at the
point of non-viability of the issuing institution or its group. Accordingly, the BRRD contemplates that
resolution authorities may require the write down of such capital instruments in full or on a permanent
basis, or their conversion in full into shares or other instruments of ownership, to the extent required
and up to their capacity, at the point of non-viability immediately before or in concurrence with the
application of any other resolution action, if any.

The BRRD provides, inter alia, that resolution authorities shall exercise the write down power of
reducing or converting, according to an order of priority of credits in normal insolvency procedures, in
a way that results in:

70


-----

(a) CET1 instruments being written down or converted in proportion to the relevant losses; and
then

(b) the principal amount of other capital instruments being written down and/or converted into
CET1 (Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments) in accordance with their relative ranking.

On 23 November 2016, the European Commission presented a comprehensive package of reforms to
further strengthen the resilience of EU banks ("EU Banking Reforms") which proposals amend many
of the existing provisions set forth in, among others, the BRRD, including a proposal extending the
application of the power to write down or convert capital instruments at the point of non-viability to
include eligible liabilities issued for internal purposes. On 16 April 2019 the European Parliament
approved the proposals.

The taking of any such actions or the use of any other resolution tool could adversely affect the rights
of Noteholders, including the write-down or conversion (in whole or in part) of their Notes. Any such
actions or the perceived likelihood of any such actions being taken may adversely impact the price or
value of their investment in the Notes.

See the risk factor entitled "Single Resolution Mechanism" above and "Description of the Business of
_the Group – Recent developments on the banking regulation" below._

**_Subordinated Notes, Senior Non-Preferred Notes and certain Senior Notes: Remedies for Non-_**
**_Payment._**

The sole remedy against the Issuer available to any Noteholder for recovery of amounts owing in respect
of any payment of principal or interest in respect of any Subordinated Notes, Senior Non-Preferred
Notes or certain Senior Notes in respect of which Condition 9(b) is specified as "Applicable" in the
applicable Final Terms will be the institution of proceedings for the winding-up of the Issuer and/or
proving in any winding-up of the Issuer. As such, the remedies available to holders of any such
Subordinated Notes, Senior Non-Preferred Notes or relevant Senior Notes are more limited than those
typically available to holders of other senior ranking securities, which may make enforcement more
difficult.

**_If the Issuer has the right to redeem any Notes at its option, this may limit the market value of the_**
**_Notes concerned and an investor may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a manner_**
**_which achieves a similar effective return._**

The Issuer has the right to redeem Notes (i) upon certain taxation events, (ii) in the case of Subordinated
Notes, Senior Non-Preferred Notes and certain Senior Notes upon a change in regulatory classification
of the Notes and (iii) if so specified in the applicable Final Terms, at its option. An optional redemption
feature of Notes is likely to limit their market value. During any period when the Issuer may elect or is
perceived to be able to redeem Notes, the market value of those Notes generally will not rise
substantially above the price at which they can be redeemed. This also may be true prior to any
redemption period.

If the Issuer elects to redeem any Notes, there is a risk that the relevant Notes may be redeemed at times
when the redemption proceeds are less than the current market value of the Notes or when prevailing
interest rates may be relatively low, in which case Noteholders may only be able to reinvest the
redemption proceeds in securities with a lower yield. Potential investors should consider reinvestment
risk in light of other investments available at that time.

**_Notes may be subject to Substitution and Variation provisions_**

71


-----

If, in the case of any Series of Subordinated Notes, Condition 6(m) (Substitution and Variation of
_Subordinated Notes) is specified as being "Applicable" in the relevant Final Terms and a Capital Event_
has occurred and is continuing or if, in the case of Senior Notes and Senior Non-Preferred Notes,
Condition 6(n) (Substitution and Variation of Senior Non-Preferred Notes and Senior Notes) is
specified as being "Applicable" in the relevant Final Terms and an MREL Disqualification Event has
occurred and is continuing or if any of the tax events described in Condition 6(b) (whether or not such
Condition applies to the relevant Series of Notes) has occurred and is continuing, or in order to ensure
the effectiveness and enforceability of Condition 16(d), then the Issuer may, subject as provided in
Condition 6(l) (in respect of Subordinated Notes) and Condition 6(n) (in respect of Senior Notes and
Senior Non-Preferred Notes) of the Notes and without the need for any consent of the Noteholders,
substitute all (but not some only) of such Series of Notes for, or vary the terms of such Series of Notes
(including changing the governing law of Condition 16(d) from English law to Portuguese law or any
other European law that, after consultation with the Relevant Authority, the Issuer considers allows the
Subordinated Notes to be Tier 2 Compliant Notes or the Senior Non-Preferred Notes or relevant Senior
Notes to be MREL Compliant Notes, as the case may be) so that the Notes remain or become Tier 2
Compliant Notes or MREL Compliant Notes, as applicable.

While Tier 2 Compliant Notes and MREL Compliant Notes must otherwise contain terms that are not
materially less favourable to Noteholders than the original terms of the relevant Notes, the governing
law of Condition 16(d) may be changed from English law to Portuguese law or any other European law
in order to ensure the effectiveness and enforceability of Condition 16(d).

No assurance can be given as to whether any of these changes will negatively affect any particular
Noteholder. In addition, the tax and stamp duty consequences of holding such substituted or varied
Notes could be different for some categories of Noteholders from the tax and stamp duty consequences
for them of holding such Notes prior to such substitution or variation. There can also be no assurance
that the terms of any Tier 2 Compliant Notes or MREL Compliant Notes will be viewed by the market
as equally favourable to Noteholders, or that such Notes will trade at prices that are equal to the prices
at which the Notes would have traded on the basis of their original terms.

**_If the Notes include a feature to convert the interest basis from a fixed rate to a floating rate or vice_**
**_versa, this may affect the secondary market and the market value of the Notes concerned._**

Fixed/Floating Rate Notes are Notes which bear interest at a rate that converts from a fixed rate to a
floating rate, or from a floating rate to a fixed rate. Such a feature to convert the interest basis, and any
conversion of the interest basis, may affect the secondary market in, and the market value of, such Notes
as the change of interest basis may result in a lower interest return for Noteholders. Where the Notes
convert from a fixed rate to a floating rate, the spread on the Fixed/Floating Rate Notes may be less
favourable than then prevailing spreads on comparable Floating Rate Notes tied to the same reference
rate. In addition, the new floating rate at any time may be lower than the rates on other Notes. Where
the Notes convert from a floating rate to a fixed rate, the fixed rate may be lower than then prevailing
rates on those Notes and could affect the market value of an investment in the relevant Notes.

**_The interest rate on Reset Rate Notes will reset on each Reset Date, which can be expected to affect_**
**_the interest payments on an investment in Reset Rate Notes and could affect the market value of_**
**_Reset Rate Notes._**

Reset Rate Notes will initially bear interest at the Initial Rate of Interest until (but excluding) the First
Reset Date. On the First Reset Date, the Second Reset Date (if applicable) and each Subsequent Reset
Date (if any) thereafter, the interest rate will be reset to the sum of the applicable Mid-Swap Rate and
the Reset Margin as determined by the Calculation Agent on the relevant Reset Determination Date
(each such interest rate, a "Subsequent Reset Rate"), all as further described in Condition 4(b). The
Subsequent Reset Rate for any Reset Period could be less than the Initial Rate of Interest or the

72


-----

Subsequent Reset Rate for prior Reset Periods and could affect the market for and the market value of
an investment in the Reset Rate Notes.

**_Notes which are issued at a substantial discount or premium may experience price volatility in_**
**_response to changes in market interest rates._**

The market values of securities issued at a substantial discount (such as Zero Coupon Notes) or premium
to their principal amount tend to fluctuate more in relation to general changes in interest rates than do
prices for more conventional interest-bearing securities. Generally, the longer the remaining term of
such securities, the greater the price volatility as compared to more conventional interest-bearing
securities with comparable maturities.

**_Limitation on gross-up obligation under the Subordinated Notes, the Senior Non-Preferred Notes_**
**_and certain Senior Notes._**

The obligation under Condition 7 (Taxation) to pay additional amounts in the event of any withholding
or deduction in respect of taxes on any payments under the terms of the Subordinated Notes or (where
Condition 7(b) is specified as "Applicable" in the relevant Final Terms) the Senior Non-Preferred Notes
and the Senior Notes applies only to payments of interest and not to payments of principal or premium
(as applicable). As such, the Issuer would not be required to pay any additional amounts under the terms
of such Notes to the extent any withholding or deduction applied to payments of principal or premium
(as applicable). Accordingly, if any such withholding or deduction were to apply to any payments of
principal or premium (as applicable) under any such Notes, Noteholders may receive less than the full
amount of principal or premium (as applicable) due under such Notes upon redemption, and the market
value of such Notes may be adversely affected.

**_Notes issued as a "green bond", a "social bond" or a "sustainability bond" may not be a suitable_**
**_investment for all investors seeking exposure to green, social and/or sustainable assets_**

The Final Terms relating to any specific Tranche of Notes may provide that it will be the Issuer's
intention to apply an amount equivalent to the proceeds from an offer of those Notes specifically to a
"green", "social" or "sustainable" purpose, including, without limitation, for projects and activities that
promote climate-friendly and or other environmental or social purposes (the "Eligible Sustainable
**Projects"). There can be no assurance that the use of proceeds of an offer of any such Notes will be**
suitable for the investment criteria of an investor.

Prospective investors should have regard to the information set out the relevant Final Terms regarding
such use of proceeds and must determine for themselves the relevance of such information for the
purpose of any investment in such Notes together with any other investigation such investor deems
necessary.

In particular, no assurance is given by the Issuer, the Arranger or any Dealer that the use of such
proceeds for any Eligible Sustainable Project will satisfy, whether in whole or in part, any present or
future investor expectations or requirements as regards any investment criteria or guidelines with which
such investor or its investments are required to comply, whether by any present or future applicable law
or regulations or by its own by-laws or other governing rules or investment portfolio mandates, in
particular with regard to any direct or indirect environmental, sustainability or social impact of any
projects or uses, the subject of or related to, any Eligible Sustainable Project. Neither the Arranger nor
any Dealer shall be responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the use of proceeds in respect of any such
Notes.

Furthermore, it should be noted that the definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, and market
consensus as to what constitutes or may be classified as, a "sustainable", "green", "social" or

73


-----

equivalently-labelled project or loan that may finance such project, is currently under development. On
18 December 2019, the Council and the European Parliament reached a political agreement on a
regulation to establish a framework to facilitate sustainable development (the "Taxonomy
**Regulation"). Within the framework of the Taxonomy Regulation, the Technical Expert Group on**
Sustainable Finance ("TEG") has been asked to develop recommendations for technical screening
criteria for economic activities that can make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation or
adaptation. On 9 March 2020, the TEG published its final report on the EU taxonomy. The report
contains recommendations relating to the overarching design of the EU Taxonomy, as well as extensive
implementation guidance on how companies and financial institutions can use and disclose against the
taxonomy. On 15 April 2020, the Council adopted by written procedure its position at first reading with
respect to the Taxonomy Regulation. As next steps, the European Parliament will have to vote on the
text pursuant to the "early second reading agreement" procedure. On this basis, the European
Commission will be tasked to establish the actual classification by defining technical screening criteria,
in the form of delegated acts, for each relevant environmental objective and sector respectively. The
TEG’s recommendations are designed to support the European Commission in the development of the
delegated act on climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation under the Taxonomy
Regulation. The taxonomy for climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation should be
established by the end of 2020 in order to ensure its full application by end of 2021. Further development
of the EU Taxonomy will take place via a new Platform on Sustainable Finance, which is expected to
be operating by autumn 2020. Accordingly, no assurance is or can be given by the Issuer, the Arranger
or any Dealer to investors that any projects or loan that may finance such project will meet any or all
investor expectations regarding such "sustainable", "green" or "social" or other equivalently-labelled
performance objectives or that any adverse environmental, social and/or other impacts will not occur
during the implementation of any projects or loan that may finance such project.

No assurance or representation is given as to the suitability or reliability for any purpose whatsoever of
any opinion or certification of any third party (whether or not solicited by the Issuer) which may be
made available in connection with the issue of any Notes and in particular with any Eligible Sustainable
Project to fulfil any environmental, sustainability, social and/or other criteria. For the avoidance of
doubt, any such opinion or certification is not, nor shall be deemed to be, incorporated in and/or form
part of this Offering Circular. Any such opinion or certification is not, nor should be deemed to be, a
recommendation by the Issuer or any other person to buy, sell or hold any such Notes. Any such opinion
or certification is only current as at the date that opinion was initially issued. Prospective investors must
determine for themselves the relevance of any such opinion or certification and/or the information
contained therein and/or the provider of such opinion or certification for the purpose of any investment
in such Notes. Currently, the providers of such opinions and certifications are not subject to any specific
regulatory or other regime or oversight. The TEG has recommended that oversight of reviewers be
conducted through a centralised system organised by ESMA. However, until the legislative process for
a potential ESMA-led supervision can be fully operational, a market-based and voluntary interim
registration process for verifiers of "green", "social" or "sustainability" bonds may be set up for a
transition period, which would allow for a standardised external verification of "green", "social" or
"sustainability" bonds by a registered verifier.

In the event that any such Notes are listed or admitted to trading on any dedicated "green",
"environmental", "social" or "sustainable" or other equivalently-labelled segment of any stock exchange
or securities market (whether or not regulated), no representation or assurance is given by the Issuer or
any other person that such listing or admission satisfies, whether in whole or in part, any present or
future investor expectations or requirements as regards any investment criteria or guidelines with which
such investor or its investments are required to comply, whether by any present or future applicable law
or regulations or by its own by-laws or other governing rules or investment portfolio mandates, in
particular with regard to any direct or indirect environmental, sustainability or social impact of any
projects or uses, the subject of or related to, any Eligible Sustainable Project. Furthermore, it should be
noted that the criteria for any such listings or admission to trading may vary from one stock exchange

74


-----

or securities market to another. Nor is any representation or assurance given or made by the Issuer or
any other person that any such listing or admission to trading will be obtained in respect of any such
Notes or, if obtained, that any such listing or admission to trading will be maintained during the life of
the Notes.

While it is the intention of the Issuer to apply an amount equivalent to the proceeds of any Notes so
specified to an Eligible Sustainable Project in, or substantially in, the manner described in the relevant
Final Terms, there can be no assurance that the relevant project(s) or use(s) the subject of, or related to,
any Eligible Sustainable Project will be capable of being implemented in, or substantially in, such
manner and/or in accordance with any timing schedule and that accordingly such proceeds will be
totally or partially disbursed for such Eligible Sustainable Project. Nor can there be any assurance that
such Eligible Sustainable Project will be completed within any specified period or at all or with the
results or outcome (whether or not related to the environment) as originally expected or anticipated by
the Issuer. Any such event or failure by the Issuer will not constitute an event of default under the Notes.

Any such event or failure to apply an amount equivalent to the proceeds of any issue of Notes for any
Eligible Sustainable Project as aforesaid and/or withdrawal of any such opinion or certification or any
such opinion or certification attesting that the Issuer is not complying in whole or in part with any
matters for which such opinion or certification is opining or certifying on and/or any such Notes no
longer being listed or admitted to trading on any stock exchange or securities market as aforesaid may
have a material adverse effect on the value of such Notes and also potentially the value of any other
Notes the proceeds of which are intended to be allocated to an Eligible Sustainable Project and/or result
in adverse consequences for certain investors with portfolio mandates to invest in securities to be used
for a particular purpose.

**_Reform and Regulation of "benchmarks"._**

Interest rates and indices which are deemed to be "benchmarks" (such as LIBOR, EURIBOR or
ISDAFIX (now restructured and renamed the ICE Swap Rate) referenced swap rates) are the subject of
recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some of these reforms
are already effective whilst others are still to be implemented. These reforms may cause such
"benchmarks" to perform differently than in the past, to disappear entirely or to have other consequences
which cannot be predicted. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on any Notes
linked to or referencing such a "benchmark". The Benchmarks Regulation applies, subject to certain
transitional provisions, to the provision of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark
and the use of a benchmark within the European Union (which, for these purposes, includes the United
Kingdom). Among other things, it (i) requires benchmark administrators to be authorised or registered
(or, if non-European Union based, to be subject to an equivalent regime or otherwise recognised or
endorsed) and (ii) prevents certain uses by European Union supervised entities of "benchmarks" of
administrators that are not authorised or registered (or, if non-European Union based, not deemed
equivalent or recognised or endorsed).

The Benchmarks Regulation could have a material impact on any Notes linked to or referencing a
"benchmark", in particular, if the methodology or other terms of the "benchmark" are changed in order
to comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation. Such changes could, among other
things, have the effect of reducing, increasing or otherwise affecting the volatility of the published rate
or level of the relevant "benchmark".

More broadly, any of the national or international reforms, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny
of "benchmarks", could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the
setting of a "benchmark" and complying with any such regulations or requirements.

75


-----

Specifically, the sustainability of LIBOR has been questioned as a result of the absence of relevant
active underlying markets and possible disincentives (including possibly as a result of benchmark
reforms) for market participants to continue contributing to such benchmarks. The FCA has indicated
through a series of announcements that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will
not be guaranteed after 2021.

Separately, the euro risk free-rate working group for the euro area has published a set of guiding
principles and high level recommendations for fallback provisions in, amongst other things, new euro
denominated cash products (including bonds) referencing EURIBOR. The guiding principles indicate,
among other things, that continuing to reference EURIBOR in relevant contracts (without robust
fallback provisions) may increase the risk to the euro area financial system.

It is not possible to predict with certainty whether, and to what extent, LIBOR and EURIBOR will
continue to be supported going forwards. This may cause LIBOR and EURIBOR to perform differently
than they have done in the past, and may have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Such
factors may have (without limitation) the following effects on certain "benchmarks" (including LIBOR
and EURIBOR): (i) discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to a
"benchmark"; (ii) triggering changes in the rules or methodologies used in the "benchmark" or (iii) lead
to the disappearance of the "benchmark". Any of the above changes or any other consequential changes
as a result of national or international reforms or other initiatives or investigations, could have a material
adverse effect on the value of and return on any Notes linked to, referencing or otherwise dependent (in
whole or in part) upon a "benchmark".

The Terms and Conditions of Notes provide for certain fallback arrangements in the event that an
Original Reference Rate and/or any page on which an Original Reference Rate may be published (or
any other successor service) becomes unavailable or a Benchmark Event (as defined in the Terms and
Conditions) otherwise occurs. Either (i) the Issuer will appoint an Independent Adviser to determine a
Successor Rate or, failing which, an Alternative Reference Rate to be used in place of the Original
Reference Rate or (ii) if the Issuer is unable to appoint an Independent Adviser or the Independent
Adviser appointed is unable to determine the relevant rates, the Issuer may (after consulting with the
Independent Adviser (if any)) determine a Successor Rate or, failing which an Alternative Reference
Rate to be used in place of the Original Reference Rate. The use of any such Successor Rate or
Alternative Reference Rate to determine the Rate of Interest may result in the Notes performing
differently (including paying a lower Rate of Interest for any Interest Period) than they would do if the
Original Reference Rate were to continue to apply.

Furthermore, if a Successor Rate or Alternative Reference Rate is determined by an Independent
Adviser or the Issuer, as the case may be, the Conditions provide that the Issuer may vary the Conditions
and the Agency Terms as necessary, to ensure the proper operation of such Successor Rate or
Alternative Reference Rate, without any requirement for consent or approval of the Noteholders.

If a Successor Rate or Alternative Reference Rate is determined by an Independent Adviser or, as the
case may be, the Issuer, the Conditions also provide that an Adjustment Spread may be determined by
the Independent Adviser or, as the case may be, the Issuer to be applied to such Successor Rate or
Alternative Reference Rate. The aim of the Adjustment Spread is to reduce or eliminate, so far as is
reasonably practicable in the relevant circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit (as the case
may be) to the Noteholders as a result of the replacement of the Original Reference Rate with the
Successor Rate or the Alternative Reference Rate. However, there is no guarantee that such an
Adjustment Spread will be determined or applied, or that the application of an Adjustment Spread will
either reduce or eliminate economic prejudice to the Noteholders. If no Adjustment Spread is
determined, a Successor Rate or Alternative Reference Rate may nonetheless be used to determine the
Rate of Interest. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that a Successor Rate or an Alternative Reference
Rate will be determined or applied.

76


-----

If, following the occurrence of a Benchmark Event, no Successor Rate or Alternative Rate is determined
or the application of a Successor Rate or Alternative Rate would disqualify the notes as Tier 2 capital
or MREL-eligible liabilities, or cause the relevant regulator to treat the next interest payment date as
the effective maturity date, as applicable or, in relation to Floating Rate Notes or Reset Notes in respect
of which the above fallback arrangements do not apply, the ultimate fallback for the purposes of
calculation of the Rate of Interest for a particular Interest Period may result in the Rate of Interest for
the last preceding Interest Period being used. This may result in the effective application of a fixed rate
for Floating Rate Notes based on the rate which was last observed on the Relevant Screen Page or, in
the case of Reset Notes, the application of the previous reset Rate of Interest for a preceding Reset
Period, or for the First Reset Rate of Interest, the application of the Initial Rate of Interest applicable to
such Notes on the Interest Commencement Date. Due to the uncertainty concerning the availability of
Successor Rates and Alternative Rates, the involvement of an Independent Adviser, the potential for
further regulatory developments and the fact that the provisions of Condition 4(f) ("Benchmark
_Replacement") will not be applied if and to the extent that, in the determination of the Issuer, the same_
could reasonably be expected to prejudice the qualification of the relevant Series of Notes as regulatory
capital or eligible liabilities, where applicable, there is a risk that the relevant fallback provisions may
not operate as intended at the relevant time. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on the
value or liquidity of, and return on the Notes.

Any of the above matters, which are not subject to the approval of Noteholders, or any other significant
change to the setting or existence of the Original Reference Rate could adversely affect the ability of
the Issuer to meet its obligations under the Notes and could have a material adverse effect on the value
or liquidity of, and the amount payable under, the Notes.

**2.2** **Risks related to Notes generally**

Set out below is a brief description of certain risks relating to the Notes generally:

**_The Notes are unsecured and therefore subject to the resolution regime._**

The Notes are unsecured and therefore subject to the resolution regime, including the bail-in tool (see
further "Notes may be subject to loss absorption on any application of the general bail-in tool or be
_subject to other resolution tools and (in the case of Subordinated Notes) may be subject to loss_
_absorption at the point of non-viability of the Issuer"_ above and "Description of the Business of the
_Group – Recent developments on the banking regulation" below). The impact on investors, in a_
resolution scenario, depends crucially on the rank of the liability in the resolution creditor hierarchy. In
the event of resolution, inter alia: (i) the outstanding amount of the Notes may be reduced to zero or the
Notes may be converted into ordinary shares of BCP or other instruments of ownership; (ii) a transfer
of assets (e.g. to a bridge bank) or in a sale of business may limit the capacity of the Bank to meet its
repayment obligations; and (iii) the maturity of any Notes or the interest rate under such Notes can be
altered and the payments may be suspended for a certain period. When a resolution measure is applied
no shareholder or creditor of the institution (including the Noteholders) subject to resolution may have
losses greater than it would have if the institution had entered into liquidation ("no creditor worse off").
Noteholders may have a right to compensation if the treatment they receive in resolution is less
favourable than the treatment they would have received under normal liquidation proceedings. This
assessment must be based on an independent valuation of the firm. Completion of this assessment, as
well as payment of any potential consideration, may occur considerably later than contractual payment
dates.

**_The conditions of the Notes contain provisions which may permit their modification without the_**
**_consent of all investors._**

77


-----

The conditions of the Notes contain provisions for calling meetings of Noteholders to consider and vote
upon matters affecting their interests generally. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all
Noteholders including Noteholders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and Noteholders
who voted in a manner contrary to the majority.

The conditions of the Notes also provide that the Agent and the Issuer may, without the consent of the
Noteholders, make modifications to the Notes or the Instrument in the circumstances further described
in Condition 13.

**_Administrative co-operation in the field of taxation._**

Council Directive 2011/16/EU, as amended by Council Directive 2014/107/EU, of 9 December 2014,
introduced the automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation concerning bank accounts and
is in accordance with the Global Standard released by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development in July 2014 (the Common Reporting Standard).

Under Council Directive 2014/107/EU, of 9 December 2014, financial institutions are required to report
to the tax authorities of their respective Member State (for the exchange of information with the state
of residence) information regarding bank accounts, including custodial accounts, held by individual
persons residing in a different Member State or entities which are controlled by one or more individual
persons residing in a different Member State, after having applied the due diligence rules foreseen in
the Directive. The information refers to the account balance at the end of the calendar year, income
paid or credited in the account and the proceeds from the sale or redemption of the financial assets paid
or credited in the account during the calendar year to which the financial institution acted as custodian,
broker, nominee, or otherwise as an agent for the account holder, among others.

Portugal has implemented Directive 2011/16/EU through Decree-Law No. 61/2013, of 10 May 2013,
as amended by Decree-Law No. 64/2016, of 11 October 2016, Law No. 98/2017, of 24 August 2017,
and Law No. 17/2019, of 14 February. The Council Directive 2014/107/EU, of 9 December 2014,
regarding the mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation was also transposed
into the Portuguese law through the Decree-Law No. 64/2016, of 11 October 2016, as amended by Law
No. 98/2017, of 24 August 2017, and Law No. 17/2019, of 14 February 2019. Law no. 17/2019, of 14
February 2019 introduced the regime for the automatic exchange of financial information to be carried
out by financial institutions to the Portuguese Tax Authority (until 31 July, with reference to the
previous year) with respect to accounts held by holders or beneficiaries resident in the Portuguese
territory with a balance or value that exceeds EUR 50,000 (assessed at the end of each civil year). This
regime covers information related to years 2018 and following years.

In addition, the information regarding the registration of the financial institutions and the procedures to
comply with the reporting obligations arising from Decree-Law No. 64/2016, of 11 October 2016,
which has been amended through Law No. 98/2017, of 24 August 2017 and Law No. 17/2019, of 14
February 2019, and the applicable forms were approved by Ministerial Order ("Portaria") No. 302B/2016, of 2 December 2016, as amended by Ministerial Order ("Portaria") No. 282/2018, of 19
October 2018, Ministerial Order ("Portaria") No. 302-C/2016, of 2 December 2016, Ministerial Order
("Portaria") No. 302-D/2016, of 2 December 2016, as amended (including by Ministerial Order
("Portaria") No. 255/2017, of 14 August and by Ministerial Order ("Portaria") No. 58/2018, of 27
February 2018) and Ministerial Order ("Portaria") No. 302-E/2016, of 2 December 2016.

Investors should in any case consult their own tax advisers to obtain a more detailed explanation of this
regime and how it may individually affect them.

**_The value of the Notes could be adversely affected by a change in law or administrative practice._**

78


-----

The Agency Terms and the Notes (except Conditions 2(b) and 2(c)) are governed by, and shall be
construed in accordance with, English law. Conditions 2(b) and 2(c) and the form (representação
_formal) and transfer of the Notes, the creation of security over the Notes and the Interbolsa procedures_
for the exercise of rights under the Notes are governed by, and shall be construed in accordance with,
Portuguese law.

The conditions of the Notes are based on relevant law in effect as at the date of this Offering Circular.
No assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible judicial decision or change to relevant law
or administrative practice after the date of this Offering Circular.

**_Risks related to withholding tax on Notes._**

Under Portuguese law, income derived from the Notes integrated in and held through a centralised
system managed by Portuguese resident entities (such as the Central de Valores Mobiliários, managed
by Interbolsa), by other European Union or EEA entities that manage international clearing systems (in
the latter case if there is administrative co-operation for tax purposes with the relevant country which
is equivalent to that in place within the European Union), or, when authorised by the member of the
government in charge of finance (currently the Finance Minister), in other centralised systems held by
non-resident investors (both individual and corporate) eligible for the debt securities special tax
exemption regime which was approved by Decree-Law No. 193/2005, of 7 November 2005, as
amended, ("the special regime approved by Decree-Law No. 193/2005") may benefit from
withholding tax exemption, provided that certain procedures and certification requirements are
complied with.

Failure to comply with procedures, declarations, certifications or others will result in the application of
the relevant Portuguese domestic withholding tax to the payments without giving rise to an obligation
to gross up by the Bank.

It should also be noted that, if interest and other income derived from the Notes is paid or made available
("colocado à disposição") to accounts in the name of one or more accountholders acting on behalf of
undisclosed entities (e.g. typically "jumbo" accounts) such income will be subject to withholding tax in
Portugal at a rate of 35% unless the beneficial owner of the income is disclosed. Failure by the investors
to comply with this disclosure obligation will result in the application of the said Portuguese
withholding tax at a rate of 35% and the Bank will not be required to gross up payments in respect of
any withheld accounts in accordance with Condition 7 (Taxation).

Further, interest and other types of investment income obtained by non-resident holders (individuals or
legal persons) without a Portuguese permanent establishment to which the income is attributable that
are domiciled in a country, territory or region included in the "tax havens" list approved by Ministerial
Order No. 150/2004 of 13 February 2004, as amended from time to time (hereafter "Ministerial Order
**No. 150/2004"), is subject to withholding tax at 35%, which is the final tax on that income, unless the**
special regime approved by Decree-Law No. 193/2005 applies and the beneficial owners are central
banks and government agencies, international organisations recognised by the Portuguese state,
residents in a country or jurisdiction with which Portugal has entered into a double tax treaty or a tax
information exchange agreement in force.

**2.3** **Risks related to the market generally**

Set out below is a brief description of the main market risks, including exchange rate risk, interest rate
risk, credit risk and liquidity risk:

**_If an investor holds Notes which are not denominated in the investor's home currency, he will be_**
**_exposed to movements in exchange rates adversely affecting the value of his holding. In addition, the_**
**_imposition of exchange controls in relation to any Notes could result in an investor not receiving_**
**_payments on those Notes._**

Principal and interest on the Notes will be paid in the Specified Currency. This presents certain risks
relating to currency conversions if an investor's financial activities are denominated principally in a
currency or currency unit (the "Investor's Currency") other than the Specified Currency. These include
the risk that exchange rates may significantly change (including changes due to devaluation of the
Specified Currency or revaluation of the Investor's Currency) and the risk that authorities with
jurisdiction over the Investor's Currency may impose or modify exchange controls. An appreciation in
the value of the Investor's Currency relative to the Specified Currency would decrease (1) the Investor's
Currency-equivalent yield on the Notes, (2) the Investor's Currency-equivalent value of the principal
payable on the Notes and (3) the Investor's Currency-equivalent market value of the Notes.

Government and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls
that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate or the ability of the Issuer to make payments in
respect of the Notes. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected, or no
interest or principal.

**_The value of Fixed Rate Notes may be adversely affected by movements in market interest rates._**

Investment in Fixed Rate Notes involves the risk that subsequent changes in market interest rates may
adversely affect the value of the Fixed Rate Notes.

**_Credit ratings assigned to the Issuer or any Notes may not reflect all the risks associated with an_**
**_investment in those Notes._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may
not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to structure, market, additional factors discussed
above, and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation
to buy, sell or hold securities and may be revised or withdrawn by the rating agency at any time.

In addition, rating agencies may assign unsolicited ratings to the Notes. In such circumstances there can
be no assurance that the unsolicited rating(s) will not be lower than the comparable solicited ratings
assigned to the Notes, which could adversely affect the market value and liquidity of the Notes.

In general, European (including United Kingdom) regulated investors are restricted under the CRA
Regulation from using credit ratings for regulatory purposes, unless such ratings are issued by a credit
rating agency established in the European Union or the United Kingdom and registered under the CRA
Regulation (and such registration has not been withdrawn or suspended). Such general restriction will
also apply in the case of credit ratings issued by non-EU and non-UK credit rating agencies, unless the
relevant credit ratings are endorsed by an EU-registered or UK-registered credit rating agency or the
relevant non-EU and non-UK rating agency is certified in accordance with the CRA Regulation (and
such endorsement action or certification, as the case may be, has not been withdrawn or suspended,
subject to transitional provisions that apply in certain circumstances). If the status of a rating agency
rating the Notes changes, European (including United Kingdom) regulated investors may no longer be
able to use the rating for regulatory purposes and the Notes may have a different regulatory treatment.

80


-----

This may result in European (including United Kingdom) regulated investors selling the Notes which
may impact the value of the Notes and any secondary market. The list of registered and certified rating
agencies published by ESMA on its website in accordance with the CRA Regulation is not conclusive
evidence of the status of the relevant rating agency included in such list, as there may be delays between
certain supervisory measures being taken against a relevant rating agency and the publication of the
updated ESMA list. Certain information with respect to the credit rating agencies and ratings is set out
on the cover of this Offering Circular.

**_An active secondary market in respect of the Notes may never be established or may be illiquid and_**
**_this would adversely affect the value at which an investor could sell his Notes._**

Notes may have no established trading market when issued, and one may never develop. If a market
does develop, it may not be very liquid and such liquidity may be sensitive to changes in financial
markets. If the Notes are traded after their initial issuance, they may trade at a discount to their initial
offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, general
economic conditions and the financial condition of the Issuer and existing liquidity arrangements (if
any) might not protect Noteholders from having to sell the Notes at substantial discount to their principal
amount in case of financial distress of the Issuer. Investors may not be able to sell their Notes easily or
at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to similar investments that have a developed
secondary market. Illiquidity may have a severely adverse effect on the market value of Notes.

**GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAMME**

Under the Programme, the Issuer may from time to time issue Notes denominated in any currency
subject as set out herein. A summary of the terms and conditions of the Programme and the Notes
appears below. The applicable terms of any Notes will be agreed between the Issuer and the relevant
Dealer prior to the issue of the Notes and will be set out in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes
incorporated in, or incorporated by reference into, the Notes, and in the Final Terms applicable to such
Notes, which complete information regarding the Terms and Conditions, is more fully described under
"Form of the Notes" below.

This Offering Circular and any supplement will only be valid for listing Notes during the period of 12
months after the date of approval of this Offering Circular in an aggregate nominal amount which, when
added to the aggregate nominal amount of all Notes then outstanding or simultaneously issued under
the Programme, does not exceed EUR 25,000,000,000 or its equivalent in other currencies. For the
purpose of calculating the Euro equivalent of the aggregate nominal amount of Notes issued under the
Programme from time to time after the date of this Offering Circular:

(a) the Euro equivalent of Notes denominated in another Specified Currency (as specified in the
applicable Final Terms in relation to the relevant Notes, as described under "Form of the Notes")
shall be determined, at the discretion of the Issuer, as of the date of agreement to issue such
Notes or on the preceding day on which commercial banks and foreign exchange markets are
open for business in London, in each case on the basis of the spot rate for the sale of the Euro
against the purchase of the relevant Specified Currency in the London foreign exchange market
quoted by any leading bank selected by the Issuer on the relevant date of calculation; and

(b) the Euro equivalent of Zero Coupon Notes (as specified in the applicable Final Terms in relation
to the relevant Notes, as described under "Form of the Notes") and other Notes issued at a
discount or premium shall be calculated in the manner specified above by reference to the net
proceeds received by the Issuer for the relevant issue.

-----

**FORM OF THE NOTES**

The Notes are issued in dematerialised book entry form ("forma escritural") and are "nominativas" (i.e.,
Interbolsa, at the Issuer's request, can ask the Affiliated Members information regarding the identity of
the Noteholders and transmit such information to the Issuer). The Notes are issued in any specified
denomination provided that in the case of any Notes which are to be admitted to trading on a regulated
market within the European Economic Area or (until the end of the transition period under the UK-EU
Withdrawal Agreement) the United Kingdom or offered to the public in a Member State of the EEA or
(until the end of the transition period under the UK-EU Withdrawal Agreement) the United Kingdom
in circumstances which require the publication of a prospectus under the Prospectus Regulation, the
minimum Specified Denomination shall be as indicated in the applicable Final Terms.

The Notes will be registered by Interbolsa as management entity of Central de Valores Mobiliários.

The Notes may be held in a manner which would allow Eurosystem eligibility. Any indication that the
Notes are to be so held does not necessarily mean that the Notes of the relevant Tranche will be
recognised as eligible collateral for Eurosystem monetary policy and intra-day credit operations by the
Eurosystem either upon issue or at any times during their life as such recognition depends upon
satisfaction of the Eurosystem eligibility criteria.

Notes will only be tradable in one Specified Denomination.

As of the date of this Offering Circular, the Notes may only be issued in Euro, U.S. dollars, Sterling,
Japanese yen, Swiss francs, Australian dollars and Canadian dollars.

Each person shown in the individual securities accounts held with an Affiliated Member of Interbolsa
as having an interest in the Notes shall be considered the holder of the principal amount of Notes
recorded. One or more certificates in relation to the Notes (each a "Certificate") will be delivered by
the relevant Affiliated Member of Interbolsa in respect of its registered holding of Notes upon the
request by the relevant holder of Notes and in accordance with that Affiliated Member's procedures and
pursuant to Article 78 of the Portuguese Securities Code (Código dos Valores Mobiliários).

Any holder of Notes will (except as otherwise required by law) be treated as its absolute owner for all
purposes regardless of the theft or loss of the Certificate issued in respect of it and no person will be
liable for so treating any holder of Notes.

If the relevant Final Terms specify TEFRA C as being applicable, the Notes will be issued in compliance
with U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(C) (or any successor United States Treasury
regulation section, including without limitation, successor regulations issued in accordance with
Internal Revenue Service Notice 2012-20 or otherwise in connection with the United States Hiring
Incentives to Restore Employment Act of 2010) (TEFRA C).

The Issuer may agree with any Dealer and the Agent that Notes may be issued in a form not
contemplated by the Terms and Conditions of the Notes, in which event a new Offering Circular or a
Supplement to the Offering Circular, if appropriate, will be made available which will describe the
effect of the agreement reached in relation to such Notes.

[PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA [AND UK] RETAIL INVESTORS - The Notes are not
intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and, with effect from such date, should not
be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area
("EEA") [or in the United Kingdom (the "United Kingdom" or the "UK")]. For these purposes, a retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article
4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, "MiFID II"); (ii) a customer within the meaning of (EU)
2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation (as
defined below). Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No.
1286/2014 (as amended, the "PRIIPs Regulation") for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the EEA [or in the UK] has been prepared and therefore
offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA [or

all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. [Consider any negative target market]. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the Notes (a "distributor") should take into consideration the manufacturer['s/s'] target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own
target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer['s/s']
target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.]

assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels[, subject to the distributor's suitability
and appropriateness obligations under MiFID II, as applicable].]

[Any person making or intending to make an offer of the Notes may only do so[:

(a) in those Public Offer Jurisdictions mentioned in Paragraph 8 of Part B below, provided such
person is of a kind specified in that paragraph, a Dealer, Manager or an Authorised Offeror (as
such term is defined in the Offering Circular (as defined below)) and that the offer is made
during the Offer Period specified in that paragraph and that any conditions relevant to the use
of the Offering Circular are complied with; or

(b) otherwise] in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or any Dealer to publish
a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Regulation or to supplement a prospectus
pursuant to Article 23 of the Prospectus Regulation, in each case, in relation to such offer.

Neither the Issuer nor any Dealer has authorised, nor do they authorise, the making of any offer of Notes
in any other circumstances.][2]

intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and, with effect from such date, should not
be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area

investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article
4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, "MiFID II"); (ii) a customer within the meaning of
Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in
point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus
Regulation (as defined below). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation
(EU) No. 1286/2014 (as amended, the "PRIIPs Regulation") for offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA [or in the UK] has been prepared and

all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. [Consider any negative target market]. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the Notes (a "distributor") should take into consideration the manufacturer['s/s'] target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own
target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer['s/s']

In these Conditions, "Euro" means the currency introduced at the start of the third stage of European
economic and monetary union pursuant to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as
amended.

**1.** **Form, Denomination and Title**

The Notes will be in book entry form ("forma escritural"), being "nominativas" (i.e. Interbolsa, at the
Issuer's request, can ask the Affiliated Members for information regarding the identity of the
Noteholders and transmit such information to the Issuer) and, subject to applicable legal or regulatory
restrictions, in any currency as agreed between the Issuer and the relevant Dealer(s) at the time of the
issue (the "Specified Currency") and the denominations (the "Specified Denomination(s)" specified
in the applicable Final Terms.

This Note is a Senior Note, a Subordinated Note, or a Senior Non-Preferred Note, as indicated in the
applicable Final Terms.

This Note is a Fixed Rate Note, a Reset Rate Note, a Floating Rate Note or a Zero Coupon Note, or any
appropriate combination of any of the foregoing, depending upon the Interest Basis shown in the
applicable Final Terms.

Title to the Notes passes upon registration in the relevant individual securities accounts held with an
Affiliated Member of Interbolsa.

Subject as set out below, the Issuer and the Agent will (except as otherwise required by law) deem and
treat any person in whose name a Note is registered as the absolute owner thereof (whether or not
overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing thereon or notice of any previous loss
or theft thereof) for all purposes.

**2.** **Status of the Notes**

The applicable Final Terms will indicate whether the Notes are Senior Notes, Subordinated Notes or
Senior Non-Preferred Notes.

(a) _In the case of Senior Notes_

If the Notes are specified as Senior Notes in the applicable Final Terms, the Notes are direct,
unconditional, unsecured (subject (where applicable) to the provisions of Condition 3) and
unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer and rank and will rank pari passu among themselves
and with all present and future unsecured (subject as aforesaid) and unsubordinated obligations
of the Issuer which do not qualify as Statutory Senior Non-Preferred Obligations, save for those
that have been accorded by law preferential rights.

If the applicable Final Terms specifies the "Senior Notes Waiver of Set-Off" is "Applicable",
no Noteholder of Senior Notes may exercise or claim any right of set-off or netting in respect
of any amount owed by it to the Issuer arising out of or in connection with the Senior Notes
and each such Noteholder shall, by virtue of its subscription, purchase or holding of any Senior
Note, be deemed to have waived all such rights of set-off or netting.

If the applicable Final Terms specifies the "Senior Notes Waiver of Set-Off" is "Applicable",
to the extent that any set-off takes place, whether by operation of law or otherwise, between:
(y) any amount owed by the Issuer to a Noteholder arising under or in connection with the
Senior Notes; and (z) any amount owed to the Issuer by such Noteholder, such Noteholder will
immediately transfer such amount which is set-off to the Issuer or, in the event of its winding

117


-----

up or dissolution, the liquidation or insolvency estate, to be held on trust for the Senior Creditors
of the Issuer.

(b) _In the case of Subordinated Notes_

If the Notes are specified as Subordinated Notes in the applicable Final Terms, the Notes are
direct, unconditional and unsecured obligations of the Issuer, save that the claims of the holders
of the Notes in respect of payments pursuant thereto will, in the event of the winding-up of the
Issuer (to the extent permitted by Portuguese law), be wholly subordinated to the claims of all
Senior Creditors of the Issuer and shall rank:

(i) at least _pari passu with the claims of holders of all obligations of the Issuer which_
constitute, or would but for any applicable limitation on the amount of such capital
constitute, Tier 2 instruments of the Issuer; and

(ii) in priority to (1) the claims of holders of all obligations of the Issuer which constitute,
or would but for any applicable limitation on the amount of such capital constitute, Tier
1 instruments of the Issuer, (2) the claims of holders of all undated or perpetual
subordinated obligations of the Issuer (other than any such obligations which rank, or
are expressed to rank, pari passu with, or in priority to, the Subordinated Notes), (3)
the claims of holders of all classes of share capital of the Issuer and (4) the claims of
holders of all other obligations of the Issuer which rank, or are expressed to rank, junior
to the Subordinated Notes.

The subordination of the Notes is for the benefit of the Issuer and all Senior Creditors of the
Issuer. "Senior Creditors of the Issuer" means (a) creditors of the Issuer whose claims are
admitted to proof in the winding-up of the Issuer and who are unsubordinated creditors of the
Issuer (including Senior Notes and Statutory Senior Non-Preferred Obligations), and (b)
creditors of the Issuer whose claims are or are expressed to be subordinated to the claims of
other creditors of the Issuer (other than those whose claims relate to obligations which
constitute, or would, but for any applicable limitation on the amount of such capital, constitute
Tier 1 instruments or Tier 2 instruments of the Issuer, or whose claims otherwise rank or are
expressed to rank pari passu with, or junior to, the claims of holders of the Subordinated Notes);
"Tier 1 instruments" has the meaning given to it by the Applicable Banking Regulations from
time to time; and "Tier 2 instruments" has the meaning given to it by the Applicable Banking
Regulations from time to time.

No Noteholder of Subordinated Notes may exercise or claim any right of set-off or netting in
respect of any amount owed by it to the Issuer arising out of or in connection with the
Subordinated Notes and each such Noteholder shall, by virtue of its subscription, purchase or
holding of any Subordinated Note, be deemed to have waived all such rights of set-off or
netting.

To the extent that any set-off takes place, whether by operation of law or otherwise, between:
(y) any amount owed by the Issuer to a Noteholder arising under or in connection with the
Subordinated Notes; and (z) any amount owed to the Issuer by such Noteholder, such
Noteholder will immediately transfer such amount which is set-off to the Issuer or, in the event
of its winding up or dissolution, the liquidation or insolvency estate, to be held on trust for the
Senior Creditors of the Issuer.

118


-----

(c) _In the case of Senior Non-Preferred Notes_

If the Notes are specified as Senior Non-Preferred Notes in the applicable Final Terms, the
Notes qualify as, and comprise part of the class of, Statutory Senior Non-Preferred Obligations
and are direct, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer and, save for those
preferred by mandatory and/or overriding provisions of law, rank and will rank:

(i) _pari passu and without any preference among themselves and with all other present_
and future obligations of the Issuer qualifying as Statutory Senior Non-Preferred
Obligations;

(ii) in the event of the bankruptcy (insolvência) of the Issuer only, junior to any present
and future unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer which do not qualify
as Statutory Senior Non-Preferred Obligations; and

_(iii)_ senior to any Junior Obligations.

By virtue of such ranking, payments to Noteholders of Senior Non-Preferred Notes will, in the
event of the bankruptcy (insolvência) of the Issuer, only be made after all claims in respect of
unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer which do not qualify as Statutory Senior
Non-Preferred Notes have been satisfied.

No Noteholder of Senior Non-Preferred Notes may exercise or claim any right of set-off or
netting in respect of any amount owed by it to the Issuer arising out of or in connection with
the Senior Non-Preferred Notes and each such Noteholder shall, by virtue of its subscription,
purchase or holding of any Senior Non-Preferred Note, be deemed to have waived all such
rights of set-off or netting.

To the extent that any set-off takes place, whether by operation of law or otherwise, between:
(y) any amount owed by the Issuer to a Noteholder arising under or in connection with the
Senior Non-Preferred Notes; and (z) any amount owed to the Issuer by such Noteholder, such
Noteholder will immediately transfer such amount which is set-off to the Issuer or, in the event
of its winding up or dissolution, the liquidation or insolvency estate, to be held on trust for the
creditors of any present and future unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer which do not qualify
as Statutory Senior Non-Preferred Obligations.

As used in this Condition 2(c):

"Junior Obligations" means any present and future claims in respect of obligations of the
Issuer which rank or are expressed to rank, subordinated to claims in respect of unsubordinated
and unsecured obligations of the Issuer (including Statutory Senior Non-Preferred Obligations);

the full nominal amount outstanding of Fixed Rate Notes and will be paid to the Affiliate
Members of Interbolsa for distribution by them to the accounts of entitled Noteholders in
accordance with Interbolsa's usual rules and operating procedures.

Such interest shall be calculated in respect of any period by applying the Rate of Interest to the

divided by the product of (x) the number of days in such
Determination Period and (y) the number of Determination
Dates (as specified in the applicable Final Terms) that would
occur in one calendar year; and

highest quotation, one only of such quotations) and the lowest (or, if there is
more than one such lowest quotation, one only of such quotations) shall be
disregarded by the Agent for the purpose of determining the arithmetic mean
(rounded as provided above) of such offered quotations.

If the Relevant Screen Page is not available or if, in the case of (A), no such offered
quotation appears or, in the case of (B), fewer than three such offered quotations appear,
in each case at the Specified Time, the Agent shall request each of the Reference Banks
(as defined below) to provide the Agent with its offered quotation (expressed as a

Period shall be the arithmetic mean (rounded if necessary to the fifth decimal place
with 0.000005 being rounded upwards) of such offered quotations plus or minus (as
appropriate) the Margin (if any), all as determined by the Agent.

If on any Interest Determination Date one only or none of the Reference Banks provides
the Agent with such offered quotations as provided in the preceding paragraph, the Rate
of Interest for the relevant Interest Period shall be the rate per annum which the Agent
determines as being the arithmetic mean (rounded if necessary to the fifth decimal
place, with 0.000005 being rounded upwards) of the rates, as communicated to (and at
the request of) the Agent by the Reference Banks or any two or more of them, at which
such banks were offered, at approximately the Specified Time on the relevant Interest
Determination Date, deposits in the Specified Currency for a period equal to that which
would have been used for the Reference Rate by leading banks in the London interbank
market (if the Reference Rate is LIBOR) or the Eurozone interbank market (if the
Reference Rate is EURIBOR) plus or minus (as appropriate) the Margin (if any) or, if
fewer than two of the Reference Banks provide the Agent with such offered rates, the
offered rate for deposits in the Specified Currency for a period equal to that which
would have been used for the Reference Rate, or the arithmetic mean (rounded as
provided above) of the offered rates for deposits in the Specified Currency for a period
equal to that which would have been used for the Reference Rate, at which, at
approximately the Specified Time on the relevant Interest Determination Date, any one
or more banks (which bank or banks is or are in the opinion of the Issuer suitable for
such purpose) informs the Agent it is quoting to leading banks in the London interbank
market (if the Reference Rate is LIBOR) or the Eurozone interbank market (if the
Reference Rate is EURIBOR) plus or minus (as appropriate) the Margin (if any),
provided that, if the Rate of Interest cannot be determined in accordance with the
foregoing provisions of this paragraph, the Rate of Interest shall be determined as at
the last preceding Interest Determination Date (though substituting, where a different
Margin is to be applied to the relevant Interest Period from that which applied to the
last preceding Interest Period, the Margin relating to the relevant Interest Period, in
place of the Margin relating to that last preceding Interest Period).

For the purposes of this Condition 4(c)(iv), "Reference Banks" means, in the case of
(A), those banks whose offered rates were used to determine such quotation when such
quotation last appeared on the Relevant Screen Page and, in the case of (B), those banks
whose offered quotations last appeared on the Relevant Screen Page when no fewer

(v) Minimum Rate of Interest and/or Maximum Rate of Interest

If the applicable Final Terms specifies a Minimum Rate of Interest for any Interest
Period, then, in the event that the Rate of Interest in respect of such Interest Period
determined in accordance with the above provisions is less than such Minimum Rate
of Interest, the Rate of Interest for such Interest Period shall be such Minimum Rate of
Interest. If the applicable Final Terms specifies a Maximum Rate of Interest for any
Interest Period, then, in the event that the Rate of Interest in respect of such Interest
Period determined in accordance with the above provisions is greater than such
Maximum Rate of Interest, the Rate of Interest for such Interest Period shall be such

(vi) Determination of Rate of Interest and Calculation of Interest Amounts

The Agent, in the case of Floating Rate Notes will, at or as soon as practicable after
each time at which the Rate of Interest is to be determined, determine the Rate of
Interest for the relevant Interest Period. The Agent will calculate the amount of interest
("Interest Amount") payable on the Floating Rate Notes for the relevant Interest
Period by applying the Rate of Interest to the aggregate outstanding nominal amount
of the Notes and multiplying such sum by the applicable Day Count Fraction, and
rounding the resultant figure to the nearest sub-unit of the relevant Specified Currency,
half of any such sub-unit being rounded upwards or otherwise in accordance with
applicable market convention.

"Day Count Fraction" means, in respect of the calculation of an amount of interest for
any Interest Period:

Final Terms, the actual number of days in the Interest Period divided by 365
(or, if any portion of that Interest Period falls in a leap year, the sum of (1) the
actual number of days in that portion of the Interest Period falling in a leap
year divided by 366 and (2) the actual number of days in that portion of the
Interest Period falling in a non-leap year divided by 365);

number of days in the Interest Period divided by 365;

(III) if "Actual/365 (Sterling)" is specified in the applicable Final Terms, the actual
number of days in the Interest Period divided by 365 or, in the case of an
Interest Payment Date falling in a leap year, 366;

(vii) Linear Interpolation

Where Linear Interpolation is specified as applicable in respect of an Interest Period in
the applicable Final Terms, the Rate of Interest for such Interest Period shall be
calculated by the Agent by straight line linear interpolation by reference to two rates
based on the relevant Reference Rate (where Screen Rate Determination is specified as
applicable in the applicable Final Terms) or the relevant Floating Rate Option (where
ISDA Determination is specified as applicable in the applicable Final Terms), one of
which shall be determined as if the Designated Maturity were the period of time for
which rates are available next shorter than the length of the relevant Interest Period and
the other of which shall be determined as if the Designated Maturity were the period of
time for which rates are available next longer than the length of the relevant Interest
Period provided however that if there is no rate available for a period of time next
shorter or, as the case may be, next longer, then the Agent shall determine such rate at
such time and by reference to such sources as it determines appropriate.

"Designated Maturity" means, in relation to Screen Rate Determination, the period of
time designated in the Reference Rate.

exchange on which the relevant Floating Rate Notes are for the time being listed and
notice thereof to be published in accordance with Condition 12 as soon as possible after
their determination but in no event later than the fourth Lisbon Business Day (as
defined below) thereafter. Each Interest Amount and Interest Payment Date so notified
may subsequently be amended (or appropriate alternative arrangements made by way
of adjustment) in the event of an extension or shortening of the Interest Period. Any
such amendment will be promptly notified to each stock exchange on which the
relevant Floating Rate Notes are for the time being listed and to the Noteholders in
accordance with Condition 12. For the purposes of this sub-paragraph (viii), the
expression "Lisbon Business Day" means a day (other than a Saturday or a Sunday)

132


-----

liability to the Issuer or the Noteholders shall attach to the Agent in connection with the exercise
or non-exercise by it of its powers, duties and discretions pursuant to such provisions.

(e) _Accrual of Interest_

Each Note will cease to bear interest (if any) from the due date for its redemption unless, upon
due presentation thereof, payment of principal is improperly withheld or refused. In such event,
interest will continue to accrue until whichever is the earlier of: (i) the date on which all amounts
due in respect of such Note have been paid; and (ii) five days after the date on which the full
amount of the moneys payable in respect of such Note has been received by the Agent and
notice to that effect has been given to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 12.

(f) _Benchmark Replacement_

This Condition 4(e) applies only to Reset Rate Notes and Floating Rate Notes where Screen
Rate Determination is specified in the applicable Final Terms as the manner in which the Rate
of Interest (or any component part thereof) is to be determined. If the Issuer determines that a
Benchmark Event occurs in relation to an Original Reference Rate when any Rate of Interest
(or any component part thereof) remains to be determined by reference to such Original
Reference Rate, then the following provisions shall apply to the Notes:

(i) the Issuer shall use reasonable endeavours, as soon as reasonably practicable, to appoint
at its own expense an Independent Adviser to determine (without any requirement for
the consent or approval of the Noteholders) (A) a Successor Rate or, failing which, an
Alternative Reference Rate, for the purposes of determining the Rate of Interest (or the
relevant component part thereof) applicable to the Notes and (B) in either case, an
Adjustment Spread. Without prejudice to the definitions thereof, for the purposes of
determining any Successor Rate, Alternative Reference Rate and/or any Adjustment
Spread, the Independent Adviser will take into account any relevant and applicable
market precedents as well as any published guidance from relevant associations
involved in the establishment of market standards and/or protocols in the international
debt capital markets;

(ii) if the Issuer (i) is unable to appoint an Independent Adviser; or (ii) the Independent
Adviser appointed by it fails to determine a Successor Rate or, failing which, an
Alternative Reference Rate in accordance with this Condition 4(e) prior to the relevant
Interest Determination Date, the Issuer (acting in good faith and in a commercially
reasonable manner and following consultation with the Independent Adviser in the
event one has been appointed but without any requirement for the consent or approval
of the Noteholders) may determine (A) a Successor Rate or, failing which, an
Alternative Reference Rate and (B) in either case, an Adjustment Spread in accordance
with this Condition 4(e). Without prejudice to the definitions thereof, for the purposes
of determining any Successor Rate, Alternative Reference Rate and/or any Adjustment
Spread, the Issuer will take into account any relevant and applicable market precedents
as well as any published guidance from relevant associations involved in the
establishment of market standards and/or protocols in the international debt capital
markets;

(iii) if a Successor Rate or, failing which, an Alternative Reference Rate (as applicable) is
determined in accordance with paragraphs (i) or (ii) above, such Successor Rate or,
failing which, Alternative Reference Rate (as applicable) shall be the Original
Reference Rate (subject to the subsequent operation of, and to adjustment as provided
in, this Condition 4(e);

133


-----

(iv) if the Independent Adviser or, as the case may be, the Issuer (following consultation
with the Independent Adviser (if any) but without any requirement for the consent or
approval of the Noteholders) in each case acting in good faith and in a commercially
reasonable manner, determines that an Adjustment Spread is required to be applied to
the Successor Rate or the Alternative Reference Rate (as applicable) and determines
the quantum of, or a formula or methodology for determining, such Adjustment Spread,
then such Adjustment Spread shall be applied to the Successor Rate or the Alternative
Reference Rate (as applicable). If the Independent Adviser or, as the case may be, the
Issuer is unable to determine the quantum of, or a formula or methodology for
determining, such Adjustment Spread, then the Successor Rate or Alternative
Reference Rate (as applicable) will apply without an Adjustment Spread;

(v) if the Independent Adviser or, as the case may be, the Issuer (following consultation
with the Independent Adviser (if any) but without any requirement for the consent or
approval of the Noteholders) in each case acting in good faith and in a commercially
reasonable manner, determines a Successor Rate or, failing which, an Alternative
Reference Rate (as applicable) and/or an Adjustment Spread in accordance with the
above provisions, the Independent Adviser or, as the case may be, the Issuer may
(without any requirement for the consent or approval of the holders of the Notes) also
specify changes to these Conditions and/or the Agency Terms in order to ensure the
proper operation of such Successor Rate or Alternative Reference Rate or any
Adjustment Spread (as applicable), including, but not limited to, (A) the Day Count
Fraction, Screen Page, Business Day, Interest Determination Date, Reset
Determination Date, Mid-Swap Rate, Mid-Market Swap Rate and/or the definition of
Reference Rate and (B) the method for determining the fall-back rate in relation to the
Notes. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer and the Agent shall effect such
consequential amendments to the Set of Agency Procedures and/or these Conditions as
may be required in order to give effect to the application of this Condition 4(e). No
consent shall be required from the Noteholders in connection with determining or
giving effect to the Successor Rate, Alternative Reference Rate or any Adjustment
Spread (as applicable) or such other changes, including for the execution of any
documents or other steps to be taken by the Issuer or the Agent (if required or useful);
and

(vi) the Issuer shall promptly, following the determination of any Successor Rate,
Alternative Reference Rate or Adjustment Spread (as applicable), give notice thereof
to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 12 (Notices) and the Agent (if
different from the Issuer). Such notice shall specify the effective date(s) for such
Successor Rate or Alternative Reference Rate (as applicable), the Adjustment Spread
(if any) and any consequential changes made to the Set of Agency Procedures and/or
these Conditions (if any).

An Independent Adviser appointed pursuant to this Condition 4(e) shall act in good faith and
(in the absence of bad faith or fraud) shall have no liability whatsoever to the Agent or the
Noteholders for any advice given to the Issuer in connection with any determination made by
the Issuer pursuant to this Condition 4(e).

Without prejudice to the obligations of the Issuer under this Condition 4(e), the Original
Reference Rate and the other provisions in this Condition 4(e) will continue to apply (i) if the
Independent Adviser or, as the case may be, the Issuer (following consultation with the
Independent Adviser (if any) but without any requirement for the consent or approval of the
Noteholders) is unable to or does not determine a Successor Rate or an Alternative Reference
Rate in accordance with this Condition 4(e), and (ii) where the Independent Adviser or, as the

134


-----

case may be, the Issuer does determine a Successor Rate or Alternative Reference Rate, unless
and until the Agent (if different from the Issuer) and (in accordance with Condition 12
(Notices)) the Noteholders have been notified of the Successor Rate or Alternative Reference
Rate (as applicable), the Adjustment Spread (if any) and any consequential changes made to
the Set of Agency Procedures and the Conditions (if any). For the avoidance of doubt, this
paragraph shall apply to the relevant next succeeding Interest Period or Reset Period (as
applicable) only and any subsequent Interest Periods or Reset Periods (as applicable) are subject
to the subsequent operation of, and to adjustment as provided in, this Condition 4(e).

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Condition 4(e), no Successor Rate or Alternative
Reference Rate or Adjustment Spread (as applicable) will be adopted, and no other amendments
to the terms of the Notes will be made pursuant to this Condition 4(e), if and to the extent that,
in the determination of the Issuer, the same could reasonably be expected to prejudice the
qualification of the Notes as:

(a) in the case of Senior Non-Preferred Notes and Restricted Senior Notes, MREL Eligible
Liabilities; or

(b) in the case of Subordinated Notes, Tier 2 instruments of the Issuer,

or, in the case of Restricted Senior Notes and Senior Non-Preferred Notes only, if and to the
extent that, in the determination of the Issuer, the same could reasonably be expected to result
in the Relevant Authority treating a future Reset Date or Interest Payment Date (as applicable)
as the effective maturity of the Notes, rather than the relevant Maturity Date.

For the purposes of this Condition 4(e):

"Adjustment Spread" shall mean a spread (which may be positive or negative) or formula or
methodology for calculating a spread, which the Independent Adviser or, as the case may be,
the Issuer (following consultation with the Independent Adviser (if any) but without any
requirement for the consent or approval of the Noteholders) in each case acting in good faith
and in a commercially reasonable manner, determines is required to be applied to the Successor
Rate or the Alternative Reference Rate (as applicable) in order to reduce or eliminate, to the
extent reasonably practicable in the relevant circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit
(as applicable) to the Noteholders as a result of the replacement of the Original Reference Rate
with the Successor Rate or the Alternative Reference Rate (as applicable) and is the spread,
formula or methodology which:

(a) in the case of a Successor Rate, is formally recommended in relation to the replacement
of the Original Reference Rate with the Successor Rate by any Relevant Nominating
Body; or

(b) in the case of a Successor Rate for which no such recommendation has been made or
in the case of an Alternative Reference Rate, the Independent Adviser or, as the case
may be, the Issuer (following consultation with the Independent Adviser (if any) but
without any requirement for the consent or approval of the Noteholders) in each case

successor administrator has been appointed that will continue publication of the
Original Reference Rate) and (B) the date falling six months prior to the specified date
referred to in (b)(A); or

(c) the making of a public statement by the supervisor of the administrator of the Original
Reference Rate stating that the Original Reference Rate has been permanently or
indefinitely discontinued; or

(d) the later of (A) the making of a public statement by the supervisor of the administrator
of the Original Reference Rate that the Original Reference Rate will, on or before a
specified date, be permanently or indefinitely discontinued and (B) the date falling six
months prior to the specified date referred to in (d)(A); or

months prior to the specified date referred to in (e)(A); or

(f) it has, or will on or prior to a specified date within the following six months, become

passed for the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer (other than for the
purposes of an amalgamation, merger or reconstruction on terms previously
approved by an Extraordinary Resolution of the Noteholders), then any
Noteholder may (X) prove and/or claim in such winding-up or dissolution and
(Y) give notice to the Issuer and to the Agent at their respective specified
offices, effective upon the date of receipt thereof by the Agent that the Notes

151


-----

held by such Noteholder(s) are, and they shall accordingly thereby forthwith
become, immediately due and repayable at their Early Redemption Amount (as
described in Condition (h)) together with accrued interest (as provided in the
Instrument).

(ii) Enforcement

Without prejudice and subject to Condition 9(b)(i), and in accordance with and to the
extent permitted by then applicable law, a Noteholder may at its discretion and without
notice institute (or apply for the institution of) such steps, actions or proceedings
against the Issuer as it may think fit to enforce any term or condition binding on the
Issuer under the Notes (other than any payment obligation of the Issuer under or arising
from the Notes, including, without limitation, payment of any principal or interest in
respect of the Notes, including any damages awarded for breach of any obligations),
_provided that, in no event shall the Issuer be obliged to pay any sum or sums, in cash_
or otherwise, sooner than the same would otherwise have been payable by it pursuant
to these Conditions (other than in the circumstances described in Condition 9(b)(i)(B)).
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Condition 9(b)(ii) shall, however, prevent a
Noteholder from instituting (or applying for the institution of) proceedings for the
winding-up of the Issuer (in accordance with and to the extent permitted by then
applicable law) and/or proving and/or claiming in any winding-up or dissolution
proceedings of the Issuer in respect of any payment obligations of the Issuer arising
from the Notes in the circumstances described in Condition 9(b)(i).

(iii) Extent of Noteholders' remedy

No remedy against the Issuer, other than as referred to in this Condition 9(b), shall be
available to the Noteholders, whether for the recovery of amounts owing in respect of
the Notes or in respect of the Instrument or any breach by the Issuer of any of its other
obligations under or in respect of the Notes or the Instrument.

**10.** **Form and transfer of Notes generally**

Notes held through accounts of Affiliate Members of Interbolsa will be represented in
dematerialised book entry form ("forma escritural") and will be "nominativas" (i.e. Interbolsa,
at the Issuer's request, can ask the Affiliated Members for information regarding the identity of
the Noteholders and transmit such information to the Issuer). Notes shall not be issued in
physical form. Notes will be registered in the relevant issue account opened by the Issuer with
Interbolsa and will be held in control accounts by the Affiliate Members of Interbolsa on behalf
of the relevant Noteholders. Such control accounts will reflect at all times the aggregate number
of Notes held in the individual securities accounts opened by the clients of the Affiliate
Members of Interbolsa (which may include Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg). The
transfer of Notes and their beneficial interests will be made through Interbolsa.

**11.** **Agent**

The name of the initial Agent and its initial specified office is set out below. If any additional
agents are appointed in connection with any Series, the names of such agents will be specified
in the applicable Final Terms.

The Issuer is entitled to vary or terminate the appointment of any agent and/or appoint
additional or other agents and/or approve any change in the specified office through which any
agent acts, provided that there will at all times be an Agent.

152


-----

Banco Comercial Português, S.A. will be the Agent.

In acting under the Agency Terms, the Agent acts solely as agent of the Issuer, and does not
assume any obligation or relationship of agency or trust to or with the Noteholders, except that
(without affecting the obligations of the Issuer to the Noteholders to repay Notes and pay
interest thereon) any funds received by the Agent for the payment of the principal of or interest
on the Notes shall be held by it on trust for the Noteholders until the expiry of the period of
prescription specified in Condition 8. The Agency Terms contains provisions for the
indemnification of the Agent and for its relief from responsibility in certain circumstances and
entitles it to enter into business transactions with the Issuer and any of its Subsidiaries without
being liable to account to the Noteholders for any resulting profit.

**12.** **Notices**

All notices regarding the Notes shall be valid if published on the website of the Issuer (being,

to trading on, and listed on the official list of, Euronext Dublin), any notice shall also be
published in accordance with any relevant listing rules. The Issuer shall also ensure that notices
are duly published in a manner which complies with the rules and regulations of any other stock
exchange (or any other relevant authority) on which the Notes are for the time being listed,
including publication on the website of the relevant stock exchange or relevant authority if
required by those rules. Any such notice will be deemed to have been given on the date of
publication or, if published more than once or on different dates, on the date of the first
publication.

Notices to be given by any Noteholder shall be in writing and given by lodging the same with
the Agent.

The Issuer shall also comply with the requirements of Interbolsa and of Portuguese law
generally in respect of notices relating to Notes.

**13.** **Meetings of Noteholders, Modification and Waiver**

The Instrument contains provisions for convening meetings of the Noteholders to consider any
matter affecting their interests, including the sanctioning by Extraordinary Resolution of a
modification of any of the provisions of the Notes. A meeting convened pursuant to the
provisions of the Instrument, may be convened by the Issuer and should be convened by the
Issuer upon a requisition by Noteholders holding not less than one-tenth in nominal amount of
the Notes for the time being remaining outstanding. The quorum at any such meeting for
passing an Extraordinary Resolution will be one or more persons holding or representing not
less than a clear majority in nominal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding, or at
any adjourned meeting one or more persons being or representing Noteholders whatever the
nominal amount of the Notes so held or represented, except that at any meeting the business of
which includes the modification of certain provisions of the Notes (including, amongst other
things, modifying the date of maturity of the Notes or any date for payment of interest thereon,
reducing or cancelling the amount of principal or the rate of interest payable in respect of the
Notes or altering the currency of payment of the Notes) or certain provisions of the Instrument,
as the case may be, the necessary quorum for passing an Extraordinary Resolution will be one
or more persons holding or representing not less than two-thirds, or at any adjourned such
meeting not less than one-third, in nominal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding.
An Extraordinary Resolution passed by the Noteholders will be binding on all the Noteholders,
whether or not they are present at any meeting.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS OF THE GROUP**

**Group Overview**

The Group is one of the largest privately owned banking groups based in Portugal, in terms of assets,
credit and deposits. The Group offers a wide range of banking products and related financial services,
both in Portugal and internationally, namely demand accounts, instruments of payment, savings and
investment products, mortgage loans, consumer credit, commercial banking, leasing, factoring,
insurance, private banking and asset management, among others, and its customers are served on a
segmented basis. Internationally, the Group has significant operations in Poland, Angola (in 2016,
BMA merged with BPA and as a result the Angola operation is now consolidated under the equity
method) and Mozambique. In addition, the Bank has a presence in Switzerland, the Cayman Islands
and Macao.

In accordance with IFRS as endorsed by the European Union, the Group had, at the end of December
2019, total assets in the amount of EUR 81,643 million and total customer funds (including customer
deposits, debt securities, assets under management, assets placed with customers and insurance products
(savings and investments)) in the sum of EUR 81,675 million. Loans to customers (gross) amounted to
EUR 54,724 million (of which EUR 52.3 billion were recorded in the caption "Financial assets at
amortised cost – Loans to customers", EUR 2.1 billion were recorded in the caption "Debt securities
held associated with credit operations" and EUR 0.372 billion (gross amount without considering fair
value adjustments) were recorded in the caption "Financial assets not held for trading mandatorily at
fair value through profit or loss - Loans and advances to customers at fair value"). According to the
interpretation of the CRD IV and CRR, CET1 fully-implemented ratio pro forma reached 12.2%, as at
31 December 2019. Based on the latest available data from Banco de Portugal, the Group accounted
for 17.1% of loans to customers (gross) and 17.8% of deposits in the Portuguese banking sector on 31
December 2019.

In addition, on 31 December 2019, the Bank was the fifth largest company listed on Euronext Lisbon
in terms of market capitalisation (EUR 3,065 million).

The Bank is registered with the Commercial Registry Office of Oporto under the sole commercial
registration and tax identification number 501 525 882 and its registered offices are located at Praça
Dom João I, 28, 4000–295 Oporto, with telephone number +351 211 134 001 and website
www.millenniumbcp.pt.

The Bank operates notably under the Portuguese Companies Code and the Banking Law. See
"Legislation regulating the activity of the Bank" below.

**Bank History**

BCP was incorporated on 17 June 1985 as a limited liability company ("sociedade anónima") organised
under the laws of Portugal following the deregulation of the Portuguese banking industry. BCP was
founded by a group of over 200 shareholders and a team of experienced banking professionals who
sought to capitalise on the opportunity to form an independent financial institution that would serve the
then underdeveloped Portuguese financial market more effectively than state-owned banks.

While the Bank's development was initially characterised by organic growth, a series of strategic
acquisitions helped solidify its position in the Portuguese market and increase its offering of financial
products and services. In March 1995, BCP acquired control of Banco Português do Atlântico, S.A.
("Atlântico"), which was then the largest private bank in Portugal. This was followed by a joint takeover
bid for the whole share capital of Atlântico. In June 2000, Atlântico was merged into BCP. In 2000,
BCP also acquired Império, along with Banco Mello and Banco Pinto & Sotto Mayor. In 2004, with a

158


-----

view to strengthening its focus on the core business of distribution of financial products and optimising
capital consumption, BCP sold insurers Império Bonança, Seguro Directo, Impergesto and
Servicomercial to the Caixa Geral de Depósitos group. BCP also entered into agreements with Fortis
(currently Ageas) for the sale of a controlling stake and management control of insurers Ocidental Companhia Portuguesa de Seguros, S.A., Ocidental - Companhia Portuguesa de Seguros de Vida, S.A.
and Médis - Companhia Portuguesa de Seguros de Saúde, S.A., as well as the pension fund manager
PensõesGere - Sociedade Gestora de Fundos de Pensões, S.A.

After the consolidation of its position in the Portuguese banking market, the Bank focused on the
development of its retail business in new regions, with the goal of attaining significant positions in
emerging markets in Europe and in Africa. The Bank concentrated on businesses with strong growth
prospects in foreign markets with a close historical connection to Portugal or that have large
communities of Portuguese origin (such as Angola, Mozambique, the United States, Canada, France,
Luxembourg and Macao), as well as in markets where the Bank's successful Portuguese business model
can be effectively exported and tailored to suit such local markets (such as Poland, Greece and
Romania). The Bank has pursued a consistent strategy of market segmentation. Until 2003, these
segments were served through autonomous distribution networks operating under a variety of brand
names. In October 2003, BCP began the process of replacing these brands in Portugal with a single
brand name Millennium bcp. The rebranding in other markets was completed in 2006. All operations
of the Bank are now carried out under the "Millennium" brand. In Portugal, the Bank also operates
under the "ActivoBank" brand.

In 2004, the Bank also sold its non-life insurance businesses and divested a portion of its life insurance
business by entering into a joint venture with Ageas (formerly Fortis), named Millenniumbcp Ageas,
of which 51% is held by Ageas and 49% by the Bank.

In recent years, the Bank has refocused on operations that it considers core to its business. As part of
this refocus, the Bank divested several of its international operations (in France, Luxembourg, United
States, Canada, Greece, Turkey and Romania), while retaining commercial protocols to facilitate
remittances from Portuguese emigrants in some markets. In 2010, the Bank transformed its Macao offshore branch into an on-shore branch.

In February 2012, the Bank adopted a management restructuring through the introduction of a one-tier
management and supervisory model, composed of the Board of Directors, including an Executive
Committee and Audit Committee (the latter comprising non-executive members, in accordance with
the applicable law), and of the Statutory Auditor.

In December 2012, the Bank prepared and presented to the Portuguese government a restructuring plan
(the "Restructuring Plan"), required by national law and by the applicable European rules on matters
of State aid. The Restructuring Plan was formally submitted by the Portuguese government to the
European Commission and, in July 2013, the Bank agreed with the European Commission a
Restructuring Plan, entailing an improvement of the profitability of the Bank in Portugal through
continued cost reduction. In September 2013, the Directorate-General for Competition announced its
formal decision in connection with its agreement with the Portuguese authorities concerning the Bank's
Restructuring Plan. Pursuant to the decision, the Bank's Restructuring Plan was found in compliance
with the European Union's rules relating to State aid, demonstrating the Bank's viability without
continued State support. The approved Restructuring Plan aimed at strengthening the Bank's strategy
by focusing on its core activities.

In May 2014, as part of a process aiming to refocus on core activities defined as a priority in its Strategic
Plan, the Bank announced that it agreed with the international insurance group Ageas a partial recast of
the strategic partnership agreements entered into in 2004, which included the sale of its 49% interest in
the (currently jointly owned) insurance companies that operate exclusively in the non-life insurance

159


-----

business, i.e. Ocidental – Companhia Portuguesa de Seguros, S.A. and Médis – Companhia Portuguesa
de Seguros de Saúde, S.A.

In April 2016, the Bank announced the conclusion of the merger between BMA and BPA, resulting in
Angola's second-largest private sector bank in terms of loans to the economy, with a market share of
approximately 10% by business volume.

BCP announced in January 2017 a EUR 1.3 billion rights issue with transferable pre-emptive
subscription rights. The aim of this transaction was to bring forward the full repayment of remaining
Government Subscribed Securities and the removal of key State-aid related restrictions, including
dividend ban, risk of potential sale of core businesses and tail risk of conversion. This transaction was
designed to strengthening the balance sheet through the improvement of CET1 FL ratio and Texas ratio,
bringing them in line with new industry benchmarks and above current regulatory requirements.

In August 2019, the merger of Bank Millennium S.A. with Euro Bank S.A. ("Eurobank") was approved
on an Extraordinary General Meeting of Bank Millennium S.A. The completion of the integration of
Euro Bank into Bank Millennium took place on 27 December 2019, with Bank Millennium S.A. being
the surviving entity from the merger and now operating under a single brand, a single operating system
and a single legal entity.

In December 2019, the merger deed of Banco de Investimento Imobiliário, S.A., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Bank, by incorporation into the latter, was signed, thus completing the incorporation
process of Banco de Investimento Imobiliário, S.A. into the Bank.

**Business Overview**

**_Nature of Operations and Principal Activities_**

The Group provides a wide variety of banking services and financial activities in Portugal and abroad,
where it is present in the following markets: Poland, Switzerland, Mozambique, Angola (through its
associate BMA) and China. In Portugal, the Bank's operations are primarily in retail banking, but it
also offers a complete range of additional financial services (in accordance with Article 3 of the articles
of association of the Bank, which provides that "the purpose of the Bank is to engage in banking
activities with such latitude as may be permitted by law"). The Bank also engages in a number of
international activities and partnerships.

The Bank's banking products and services include demand accounts, instruments of payment, savings
and investments, mortgage loans, consumer credit, commercial banking, leasing, factoring, insurance,
private banking and asset management, among others. The Bank's domestic retail banking activities
are conducted mainly through its marketing and distribution network in Portugal, which follows a
segmented approach to the Portuguese retail banking market and serves the diverse banking needs of
specific groups of customers. Back office operations for the distribution network are integrated in order
to explore economies of scale.

The Bank has subsidiaries that offer additional financial services, including investment banking, asset
management and insurance. These subsidiaries generally distribute their products through the Bank's
distribution networks. The Bank's retail banking and related financial services activities, together with
its international operations and partnerships, are described in greater detail below.

**_Strategy_**

Since 2011, the Group has successfully executed an operational turnaround, reinforcing its financial
and capital position despite the adverse setting of the banking sector in the core Portuguese market.

160


-----

This position reflects achievements, such as a cost reduction of approximately 40% in Portugal since
2011, and a reduction in Group NPEs exceeding 60% since 2013 (from EUR 13.7 billion in December
2013 to EUR 4.2 billion in December 2019). Three distinctive competences were at the core of this
turnaround: a customer-oriented relationship model, market-leading efficiency, and a competitive
international portfolio.

The Bank is now ready to embark on a new cycle of growth with profitability, requiring complementary
capabilities to cope with the evolving context and the need to secure a fully sustainable position. These
include leading digital, mobile, and analytics capabilities (preparing the organisation to be competitive
in the new age) and integration in value chains and ecosystems (embedding into its customers' needs
and reach), complemented by a robust balance sheet and rigorous capital allocation and shaped by
strong governance (continuing its effort to de-risk the portfolio and reinforcing focus on value-added
business).

Against this backdrop, the Bank has defined five overarching priorities for the future:

- _Talent mobilisation, which will entail energising employees to drive the Bank's agenda as a team,_
promoting greater engagement and proactivity and empowering decision making in a collaborative
model. The Bank's talent will also to be reinvigorated by developing a merit-based growth model
and fostering the development of new capabilities. Finally, the Bank will review its compensation
processes across teams to ensure alignment with the new agenda and performance.

- _Mobile-centric digitisation, aspiring to double down on efforts to transform customer experience_
and enable productivity gains across geographies, reemphasising Millennium's innovation
trademark. The main priorities consist of redesigning the digital experience from a mobile-centric
approach, transforming top customer journeys, setting up a convenient and productive omnichannel
model, and transforming operations through the deployment of NextGen technologies (such as
robotics and natural language processing). In parallel, an IT strategy focused on upgrading
technology, data, security, and ways of working will enable these levers.

- _Growth and leading position in Portugal, aiming to maximize the potential of the unique position_
in which the Bank emerges out of the financial crisis (the largest private Portuguese bank) implying
a renewed commitment to grow the customer base and expand relationships. This will materialize
into helping Portuguese businesses thrive (e.g., building a position as the preferred partner for sound
small businesses), while serving its individual customers across their full range of needs. The
Group further aspire to capture the full potential of ActivoBank's simple and value-based offer and
assess potential internationalisation options.

- _Growth in international footprint, with the objective of capitalising on the opportunities offered by_
the high-growth intrinsics of markets where the Bank has a presence and competitive advantage.
This implies growing in Poland by deepening retail relationships and enlarging the customer
business base; a step change in Switzerland by growing existing business and exploring new
markets and digital advice; leveraging market leading position in Mozambique to focus on
profitability and capturing the tailwinds of large commodity investments planned; building on its
position in Angola as a trusted and sound business partner with unique local relationships; and
exploring emerging China related opportunities (trade and investment flows, payments, private
banking).

- _Business model sustainability, maintaining the improvement of its credit portfolio quality as a clear_
priority, by reducing the NPE stock (reduction to EUR 3 billion by 2021) and simultaneously
lowering the cost of risk. Risk and compliance governance will also be strengthened to ensure a
sustainable growth of credit volume with a sound risk profile.

161


-----

The successful execution of these priorities should enable the Bank to accomplish a set of strategic
objectives for 2021: franchise growth (over 6 million active customers), readiness for the future (from
58% to over 60% digital customers by 2021), a sustainable business model (with NPEs reaching EUR
3 billion), and attractive returns for shareholders (approximately 40% cost-to-income and
approximately 10% ROE in 2021).

**_Business Model_**

The internal organisational model of the Bank covers four business areas: Retail, Companies, Asset
Management & Private Banking and Business Abroad (Europe, Africa and Other), and two support
units: Processes and Banking Services and Corporate Areas.

Regarding the internal organisation and decision-making structure, it is important to note the existence
of a series of Commissions and Sub-Commissions directly appointed by the Executive Commission
which, apart from the Directors who are specifically entrusted with the monitoring of matters, include
the employees of the Bank or Group who are the heads of their respective areas.

As at 3 January 2020, there were 13 Commissions and two Sub-Commissions aimed at facilitating the
coordination of current managerial decisions, involving the senior management of the units included in
each business area, with a view to reconciling perspectives and supporting the managerial decisionmaking process of the Executive Commission, as follows:

_Costs and Investments Commission: This Commission has the mission of regular follow-ups on the_

evolution and optimisation of the contracts for the purchase of goods and services which are more
significant for the Bank and of the respective negotiations and costs authorisation;

One Sub-Commission operates under the _Costs and Investments Commission, the Costs and_
_Investments Sub-Commission whose mission is the regular follow-up of the evolution and_
optimisation of the contracts for the purchase of goods and services which are more significant for
the Bank and of the respective negotiations; also issues of opinions or authorisation of costs for all
the purchases of goods and services that are not within the competence of the coordinator managers,
in accordance with the regulations in effect;

_Corporate, Investment Banking and Institutional Commission: The primary mission of this_

Commission is the assessment of the business context and proposal of commercial actions that are
appropriate for these corporate segments; the business main risk indicators and of the models for
the articulation of the business concerning its migration in the value proposal and the
interconnection of the Bank's networks;

_Human Resources Commission: The primary mission of this Commission is the definition of the_

strategy and approval of the Bank's human resources policies, including the overview of the top 10
Key Performance Indicators ("KPIs"), contracts and internal mobility, span of control,
compensation, benefits and recognition programmes. The Human Resources Commission is
internally aiming to reinforce the culture, strategic alignment and mobilisation, and externally, in
terms of value proposal and image, as well as the approach/relationship with relevant stakeholders,

_Mortgage Lending_

The Bank entered the mortgage lending business in 1992, when it launched, in association with Cariplo
– Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarda S.p.A. (now a part of the Italian financial group Banca
Intesa), an autonomous mortgage bank, Banco de Investimento Imobiliário, S.A. ("BII"). BII was
69.9% owned by the Group, with the remaining 30.1% being owned by Banca Intesa. BII previously
distributed its mortgage products through the Bank's marketing and distribution networks, as well as
through its own retail outlets. On 21 September 2005, the Bank reached an agreement with Banca
Intesa for the unwinding of the joint venture arrangements in relation to BII. In October 2005, the Bank
acquired 30.1% of the capital of BII owned by Banca Intesa, becoming the sole shareholder of BII. BII
was running a book of outstanding mortgage credit originating from mid-2007, which will progressively
be reduced over time. On 27 December 2019, the merger deed of BII, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Bank, by incorporation into the latter, was signed, thus completing the incorporation process of BII
into the Bank.

_Insurance_

The Bank has an interest in insurance activities through Millenniumbcp Ageas, a joint venture with
Ageas for bancassurance business in Portugal. On 26 May 2014, as part of a process aiming to refocus
on core activities defined as a priority in its Strategic Plan, the Bank announced that it had agreed with
the international insurance group Ageas a partial recast of the strategic partnership agreements entered
into in 2004, which included the sale of its 49% interest in the (at that time jointly owned) insurance
companies that operate exclusively in the non-life insurance business, i.e. Ocidental – Companhia
Portuguesa de Seguros, S.A. and Médis – Companhia Portuguesa de Seguros de Saúde, S.A. Currently,
the Group holds 49% of Millenniumbcp Ageas' share capital in the life insurance business, while the
remaining 51% is held by Ageas.

On 28 July 2014, the Bank announced about the qualifying holding of Ageas and Ocidental Vida that
was a result of Ageas and Ocidental Vida having subscribed, respectively, 280,490,558 and
408,855,693 ordinary shares in the rights issue launched by the Bank on 27 June 2014, pursuant to the
subscription rights attributed to them considering their participation in BCP prior to the rights issue of
156,623,179 shares in case of Ageas and of 233,631,825 shares in case of Ocidental Vida. Following
the settlement of the rights issue on 23 July 2014 and allotment of the oversubscription on 24 July, the
number of shares held by Ageas increased to 437,113,737 and the number of shares held by Ocidental
Vida increased to 652,087,518, thus the Ageas Group increased its participation to 1,089,201,255 shares
that correspond to 2.01% of the issued share capital and of voting rights of the Bank.

On 16 June 2015, the Bank announced to have received a notification from Ageas Group informing that
its holding in the share capital of the Bank had fallen below the 2% threshold of qualifying holding.
The dilution of the former qualifying holding was a result of the Bank's exchange offer of some of its
subordinated debt and preference shares for ordinary shares, causing the issuance of 4,844,313,860 new
shares, which increased the total outstanding ordinary shares in BCP to 59,039,023,275. At that date,
the Ageas Group's holding was 1.84%.

**_Foreign Business_**

BCP has concentrated on those businesses with strong growth prospects in foreign markets with a close
historical connection to Portugal or that have large communities of residents with a Portuguese heritage
(such as Angola and Mozambique), as well as in markets to which the Bank's successful business model
in Portugal can be effectively exported and tailored to suit local markets, in particular in Poland.

_Poland_

In Poland, the Bank operates through Bank Millennium, S.A. ("Bank Millennium"), and focuses its
offerings on individuals and small and medium-sized companies. Bank Millennium is a full service
national bank which, jointly with its subsidiaries, offers a complete range of financial products and
services, including deposit-taking, savings and investment products, short-, medium- and long-term
lending (including mortgage lending and consumer credit), debit and credit cards, fund transfers and
other payment methods, mutual funds, insurance, leasing, treasury services and money market
transactions.

In 1998, the Bank entered into a partnership agreement with the Polish financial group, BBG, pursuant
to which the Bank launched a retail operation with BBG in the Polish market under the "Millennium"
brand.

The Bank currently owns 50.1% of Bank Millennium.

165


-----

On 17 October 2018, Bank Millennium took over management of the assets of Spółdzielcza Kasa
Oszczędnościowo-Kredytowa Piast ("SKOK Piast") (Cooperative Credit Union SKOK Piast), based
on a decision of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority, and, on 1 November 2018, Bank
Millennium acquired SKOK Piast. Bank Millennium joined other banks involved in the SKOK
turnaround process supported by the Polish Financial Supervision Authority and the Bank Guarantee
Fund. The acquisition of SKOK Piast corresponded with efforts to ensure stability of the national
financial system and to ensure safety for all clients of financial institutions in Poland.

In 2019, the merger of Bank Millennium with Eurobank was approved, on an Extraordinary General
Meeting of Bank Millennium. The completion of the integration of Eurobank into Bank Millennium
took place on 27 December 2019, with the Bank Millennium being the surviving entity from the merger
and now operating under a single brand, a single operating system and a single legal entity

Bank Millennium acquired a 99.79% stake in Eurobank from Société Générale Financial Services
Holding ("SocGen"), a subsidiary of Société Générale S.A. The completion of the integration of
Eurobank into Bank Millennium took place on 27 December 2019.

Bank Millennium stopped granting mortgage loans in foreign currencies in 2009. Consequently the
Polish foreign exchange ("FX") mortgage loans are a mature portfolio, constantly decreasing according
to the repayment rate and with a low impairment ratio and high coverage by provisions. As at 31
December 2019, Bank Millennium's foreign exchange mortgages amounted to approximately 20% of
the Polish bank's loan book (EUR 3.2 billion), which represents 6% of the Group's total loans. On top
of these, there are also PLN 1.1 billion (approximately EUR 230 million) CHF indexed mortgages from
Eurobank but the litigation/political risk on this portfolio is covered by a 20-year indemnity provided
by SocGen, which also provided a 10-year guarantee on 80% of the credit risk on that portfolio. FX
mortgages represent 7% of its Polish subsidiary total gross loans (approximately 8% market share).

On 3 October 2019, the Court of Justice of the European Union ("CJEU") issued a judgment on Case
C-260/18, in connection with the preliminary questions formulated by the District Court of Warsaw in
the lawsuit against Raiffeisen Bank International AG. The judgment of the CJEU, as well as its
interpretation of European Union Law, is binding on domestic courts.

The CJEU's judgment concerns only the situations where the national court has previously found the
contract terms to be abusive. It is the exclusive competence of the national courts to assess, in the
course of judicial proceedings, whether a particular contract term can be identified as abusive in the
circumstances of the lawsuit. It can be reasonably assumed that the legal issues relating to FX-indexed
mortgage loans will be further examined by the national courts within the framework of the disputes
considered, which could possibly result in the emergence of further interpretations relevant for the
assessment of the risks associated with subject matter proceedings. This circumstance indicates the
need for constant analysis of these matters. Further requests for clarification and ruling addressed to
the CJEU and the Supreme Court of Poland with potential impact on the outcome of the court cases
may also be filed.

As at 31 December 2019, Bank Millennium had 2,010 FX-indexed mortgage loans subject to individual
litigations, submitted to the courts with the total value of claims filed by the plaintiffs amounting to
PLN 203 million (EUR 47.74 million). Until 31 December 2019, only 19 of these cases had obtained
a final verdict, the vast majority being in accordance with Bank Millennium's interest.

According to the Polish Bank Association (ZBP), during 2019, over 70% of the lawsuits regarding FXindexed mortgage loans obtained a final verdict favourable to the banks involved. However, after the
CJEU judgment regarding Case C-260/18 issued on 3 October 2019, there is a risk that this scenario for
the banks may change.

166


-----

Considering the increased legal risk related to FX-indexed mortgages, Bank Millennium created a
provision in the amount of PLN 223 million (EUR 52.45 million) for legal risk. The methodology
developed by Bank Millennium is based on the following main parameters: (i) the number of current
(including class actions) and potential future court cases that will appear within a specified (three-year)
time horizon; (ii) the amount of Bank Millennium's potential loss in the event of a specific court
judgment (three negative judgment scenarios were taken into account); and, (iii) the probability of
obtaining a specific court verdict calculated on the basis of statistics of judgments of the banking sector
in Poland and legal opinions obtained. Variation in the level of provisions or concrete losses will
depend on the final court decisions about each case and on the number of court cases.

Bank Millennium undertakes a number of actions at different levels towards different stakeholders in
order to mitigate legal and litigation risk regarding the FX-indexed mortgage loans portfolio. Bank
Millennium is open to negotiate case-by-case favourable conditions for early repayment (partial or total)
or the conversion of loans to PLN. On the other hand, Bank Millennium will continue to take all
possible actions to protect its interests in courts while, at the same time, being open to finding settlement
with customers in the court under reasonable conditions.

In December 2019, Bank Millennium recorded net income totalling EUR 130.5 million (EUR 65.4
million of which attributable to the Bank), a decrease of 26.3% (+16.9% excluding one-offs, in
particular, related to the integration costs and initial provisions for Eurobank, release of tax asset
provisions, positive revaluation of shares in PSP and provisions for FX related risks) when compared
to EUR 178.4 million, (EUR 89.4 million of which attributable to the Bank) in the same period of the
previous year.

Banking income was up 27.3% to EUR 808.2 million in December 2019, excluding foreign exchange
effect, positively influenced by the performance of the net interest income, which increased 33.1%
versus December 2018. Operating costs recorded an increase of 36.1% to EUR 401.8 million (+27.2%
excluding Eurobank integration costs), due to the rise in staff costs (+31.1%) and in other costs
(+46.1%). The cost-to-income ratio[21] stood at 47.9% and ROE was 6.4%, translating an improvement
in profitability and in operational efficiency. The cost of risk stood at 70 basis points accrued since the
beginning of the year and the loans to deposits ratio at around 86%. Bank Millennium keeps
comfortable levels in terms of capital, liquidity and quality of assets. The Total Consolidated Capital
Ratio of Bank Millennium stood at 20.1% and CET1 at 16.9%, comfortably above of the minimum
capital regulatory thresholds.

As at 31 December 2019, customer funds stood at to EUR 21,237 million, which represents an increase
of 20,8%, compared to EUR 17,574 million on 31 December 2018, excluding foreign exchange effect,
and loans to customers increased 31.6% from EUR 12,828 million, excluding foreign exchange effect,
to EUR 16,914 million (EUR 16,542 million recorded in "Financial assets at amortised cost – Loans
and advances to customers"; EUR 372 million (gross amount without considering fair value
adjustments) recorded in "Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss – Financial assets not held
for trading mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss"), excluding foreign exchange effect. The
number of employees totalled 8,464 at the end of December 2019. On that date, the Issuer had 830
branches, 469 more than in December 2018, impacted by Eurobank's integration.

_Mozambique_

The Bank has had banking operations in Mozambique since 1995. BIM - Banco Internacional de
Moçambique, S.A. ("Millennium bim") is the second Mozambique's largest bank in terms of assets,
loans and deposits market shares. The 3 pillars of the strategic plan of Millennium bim for 2018 are:
Human resources; Management of risk, ensuring i) prudence in liquidity management, ii) reduction of

the exposure to high risk clients, replacing it with new credit with a better risk and iii) providing support
to clients in a proactive manner to avoid default situations and, consequently, recording impairments;
and Earnings, maintaining i) focus on increasing the number of clients as a way to ensure a sustained
net income, ii) reduction of operating costs in spite of the inflationary context and currency depreciation,
and iii) good solvency and efficiency ratios, ensuring the achievement of a solid and distinctive position
in the market.

During 2019, Millennium bim recorded a net income of EUR 99.5 million, an increase of 5.8%
compared to EUR 94.1 million in December 2018, when compared to the same period of the previous
year. In this period, banking income[22] decreased by -0.1% amounting to EUR 247.4 million, excluding
foreign exchange effect, driven by the increase of commissions and other income (+9.2%), despite the
reduction of the net interest income (-3.0%). Operating costs increased 4.5% to EUR 97.8 million,
excluding foreign exchange effect, and cost-to-income stood at 47.2%. ROE stood at 20.3%. Loan
impairment amounted to EUR 19.9 million (EUR 34.8 million recorded in December 2018, excluding
foreign exchange effect) and the cost of risk decreased from 431 basis points to 277 basis points. As at
31 December 2019, Millennium bim had a capital ratio of 45.8%.

Total customer funds in December 2019 stood at EUR 1,685 million, up from the EUR 1,580 million,
excluding foreign exchange effect, recorded in December 2018, showing an increase of 6.6%. Loans
to customers (gross) amounted to EUR 717 million in December 2019, compared to EUR 802.1 million
in December 2018, a decrease of 11.2%.

As at 31 December 2019, Millennium bim had 200 branches, seven more than in the same period of
2018. At that date, the bank had 2,680 employees (excluding employees from SIM, the insurance
company) and had 2,610 employees as at 31 December 2018.

_Angola_

BMA was incorporated on 3 April 2006, as a result of the transformation of the BCP branch in Angola
into a bank incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Angola.

In February 2009, the Bank carried out financial transactions relating to the strategic partnership
agreements established with Sonangol (a company that held, as at 30 June 2017, 15.24% of the Bank's
share capital and voting rights) and Banco Privado Atlântico, S.A. ("BPA") (in which BMA held a
shareholding of 6.66%), as a result of which the Bank reduced its stake in BMA to 52.7% through
BMA's share capital increase of USD 105,752,496.80.

In April 2012, the Bank reduced its stake in BMA to 50.1%, following BMA's share capital increase,
which was fully subscribed to by Global Pactum—Gestão de Activos (main shareholder of BPA), in
line with the partnership agreement entered into with Sonangol and BPA. Within the scope of this
partnership, the Bank, Sonangol and BPA entered in May 2008 into a shareholders' agreement regarding
BMA, which included, among others, clauses on corporate bodies and preferential rights in case of
transfer of BMA's shares.

On 8 October 2015, the Bank announced it had signed a memorandum of understanding with the main
shareholder of BPA for the merger of BMA with BPA. The public deed for the merger was executed
on 22 April 2016. Following the merger, BCP owns 22.5% of the share capital of Banco Millennium
Atlântico.

22 Banking income or net operating revenues is the sum of net interest income, dividends from equity instruments, net commissions,
net trading income, other net operating income and equity accounted earnings.

-----

In the context of the BMA merger with BPA, BMA was considered a discontinued operation in March
2016. As of the completion of the merger in May 2016, the new merged entity in which the Bank
maintains a 22.5% shareholding, Banco Millennium Atlântico, is consolidated using the equity method.

**_International Partnerships_**

_Ageas_

In 2005, the Group and Fortis (currently, Ageas) established a joint venture for bancassurance business,
through the insurance company Millennium bcp Fortis (currently, Millenniumbcp Ageas). The Group
holds 49% of Millenniumbcp Ageas' share capital, while the remaining 51% is held by Ageas. In
September 2005, Ageas increased its shareholding in the Bank to 4.99%. As a consequence of the two
Bank share capital increases that took place in 2006, Ageas' shareholding in the Bank decreased to
4.94%. In September 2007, Ageas disposed of its qualifying holding in the share capital of the Bank.

169


-----

On 26 May 2014, the Bank announced that, as part of a process aiming to refocus on core activities
defined as a priority in its Strategic Plan, it had agreed with the international insurance group Ageas to
partially recast the strategic partnership agreements entered into in 2004. These include the sale of its
49% interest in the (at that time jointly owned) insurance companies that operate exclusively in the nonlife insurance business, i.e. Ocidental-Companhia Portuguesa de Seguros, S.A. and Médis - Companhia
Portuguesa de Seguros de Saúde, S.A., for a base price of EUR 122.5 million, subject to a medium term
performance adjustment. In 2013, the non-life activity posted gross inflows of EUR 251 million and a
net profit of EUR 12 million.

On 28 July 2014, the Bank announced that Ageas, on behalf of itself and its subsidiary OcidentalCompanhia Portuguesa de Seguros de Vida, S.A. ("Ocidental Vida"), had acquired a qualifying holding
in the share capital of the Bank. The qualifying holding was a result of Ageas and Ocidental Vida
having subscribed, respectively, 280,490,558 and 408,855,693 ordinary shares in the rights issue
launched by the Bank on 27 June 2014, pursuant to the subscription rights attributed to them considering
their participation in the Bank prior to the rights issue (156,623,179 shares in case of Ageas and of
233,631,825 shares in case of Ocidental Vida).

Following the settlement of the rights issue, on 23 July 2014, and allotment of the oversubscription, on
24 July, the number of shares held by Ageas increased to 437,113,737 and the number of shares held
by Ocidental Vida increased to 652,087,518, thus Ageas Insurance International Group (i.e. Ageas and
Ocidental Vida) increased its participation to 1,089,201,255 shares that correspond to 2.01% of the
issued share capital and of voting rights of BCP.

On 16 June 2015, the Bank announced that it had received an announcement from Ageas, issued on
behalf of itself and Ocidental Vida, informing that Ageas Insurance International Group (i.e. Ageas and
Ocidental Vida) holding in the share capital of the Bank had fallen below the 2% threshold of qualifying
holding (1.84%). The dilution of the former qualifying holding is a result of BCP's exchange offer of
some of its subordinated debt and preference shares for ordinary shares, causing the issuance of
4,844,313,860 new shares, which increased the total outstanding ordinary shares in BCP to
59,039,023,275.

_Sonangol and BPA_

Following the announcement made by the Bank on 8 October 2015, the Bank informed on 25 April
2016 that the public deed for the merger of Banco Millennium Angola, S.A. with Banco Privado
Atlântico, S.A. had been executed.

**Recent developments in 2020**

On 26 March 2020, the Bank informed that its Board of Directors approved, based on the results for
2019, disclosed on 20 February 2020, the individual and consolidated annual report, balance sheet and
financial statements of 2019, which were submitted for approval to the Annual General Meeting held
on 20 May 2020.

The Board of Directors considered it important to compensate the efforts of the Bank's employees who,
in the period comprised between June 2014 and June 2017, accepted a temporary reduction in their
remuneration in order to render the Bank's recovery process feasible and to contribute to the compliance
with the requirements imposed to the Bank to be able to benefit from State Aid, pursuing its
commitment to propose to the General Meeting the distribution of results to Employees that allows for
the gradual delivery of an accumulated amount at least equal to the total not received by them during
the period. It has therefore proposed to the Annual General Meeting the distribution of up to EUR
1,000.00 to each employee who has not already been fully compensated with the earnings distributed
in 2019 if he/she remains in office on the date of payment of the remuneration corresponding to June

170


-----

2020, up to a maximum total amount of EUR 5,281,000.00, pursuant to the process of compensation
for the reduction of wages agreed under the Collective Labour Agreement, as published on 29 March
2014, in the Bulletin of Labour and Employment No. 12.

On 20 May 2020, the Bank concluded, exclusively through electronic means and with 61.31% of the
share capital represented, the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, with the following resolutions:

  - Item One – Approval of the management report, the individual and consolidated annual report,

Bodies;

In view of the potential impacts and the uncertainty associated with the pandemic situation, and even
though the Bank is part of the group of financial institutions with no specific regulatory constraints
pertaining to dividend distribution, the Board of Directors also decided to propose to the Annual General
Meeting the retention of the remaining results for 2019, of which EUR 13,929,601.66 to reinforce the
legal reserve, and the remaining, in the minimum amount of EUR 120,085,414.93, to retained earnings.
This proposal aims to ensure that the Bank is better prepared to face the current uncertain context, with
the Board of Directors reiterating its determination to resume the approved dividend policy once the
crisis is overcome and as the Bank and the national economy begin to recover.

On 3 April 2020, the Bank informed that Fitch, which has been revising the ratings of the European
banks in different geographies due to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, also made a
reassessment of the Portuguese market and communicated the following rating actions on the Bank:

- Affirmed BCP's Long-Term Rating of 'BB' ("IDR"–Issue Default Rating) and its Intrinsic
Rating of 'bb' ("VR"-Viability Rating), and revised the Outlook to Negative from Positive,
reflecting the uncertainty related to the COVID-19 crisis;

- Assigned a 'BB-'rating to the Bank's senior non-preferred debt and a 'B+' rating to its Tier 2
debt, according to Fitch's new rating methodology for banks;

- Assigned a 'BB+'/'B' rating to the Bank's deposits, one notch above the Long-Term IDR,
reflecting the view of Fitch that depositors enjoy a superior level of protection."

**Principal Markets and Competition**

The Portuguese banking market has become well-developed, including both strong domestic and
foreign competitors. These competitors follow a multi-product, multi-channel and multi-client

segmented approach, offering a broad range of services from retail products to investment banking
coupled with sophisticated payment capability. Foreign banks are present in the Portuguese market, in
areas such as corporate banking, asset management, private banking and brokerage services, as well as
universal banking services, namely traditional retail banking.

Domestic banking penetration levels rank favourably on a comparable basis and branch network and
automated channels are widely disseminated across the country. There has been significant
development of remote access to banking services (ATM, home banking, and mobile banking) together
with market intelligence techniques enabling banks to accurately track customers' requirements and
augment customer proximity. Cross-selling has benefited from the use of such techniques and has
increased the proportion of banks' non-interest income over the years.

The Portuguese banking sector will face the potential entry of new and disruptive players benefiting
from the PSD2 environment. This is happening against a backdrop of progressive change towards a
new digital age in which consumers' behaviour and expectations are evolving. Current trends point to
an accelerated mobile / digital banking adoption and customers demanding personalisation. Also,
security and trust have reinforced the importance of digitalisation given cyber-risk concerns and cases
of misselling. Advances in the ability to deploy technologies (e.g., robotics, machine learning) and the
expanded capabilities these enable are setting new ways of working, requiring new skills.

The deregulation and liberalisation process experienced by the Portuguese banking sector, including
Eurozone participation, catalysed an increase in business and competition, particularly in the credit
market. Customer loans and advances increased significantly in advance of the implementation of the
euro and during the early years of economic convergence and integration within the single currency
project (Source: Banco de Portugal).

At the same time, the Portuguese banking system experienced a consolidation, which was driven by the
need to achieve economies of scale and operating synergies. More recently, against the background of
the financial instability beginning in the summer of 2007 and the subsequent euro periphery crisis,
deleveraging and strategic repositioning took place. Some foreigner players reappraised their presence
and business models and networks developed in Portugal. More recently, major banks in the Portuguese
banking system have rationalised their operating structures.

The Portuguese banking market is concentrated with the biggest five banks representing 80% of the
market share in terms of business volumes. The Bank is the largest private sector bank in Portugal in
terms of business volumes (market share of 18% by gross loans + customer funds), generates 29% of
the system core net income and is one of the most efficient banks in Portugal with only 13% of the
system branch network.

The growing maturity of the domestic market and globalisation trends led domestic banks to further
develop their operations abroad, namely in countries with which Portugal had strong economic and
historical relations. Hence, currently, the biggest domestic banking groups manage operations in
European and African countries, which bear an increasing strategic relevance for their businesses.

The Portuguese Competition Authority ensures compliance with Portuguese competition rules,
asserting regulatory powers over competition in all sectors of the economy, including regulated sectors
in coordination with the relevant sector regulators. Banco de Portugal is responsible for the prudential
and market conduct supervision, ensuring the stability of the financial system as well as compliance
with rules of conduct and transparency for banks' customers. As the national supervisory authority,
Banco de Portugal is part of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, the European banking supervision
system, entrusted with the safety and robustness of European banks. National competition authorities
and the EU have parallel competencies for enforcing European antitrust laws in close co-operation.

In Portugal, the Bank competes primarily with the four other major Portuguese banking groups: Caixa
Geral de Depósitos, Banco Santander Totta, CaixaBank/BPI and Novo Banco. BCP's extensive
distribution network, which is the second largest, has enabled it to maintain a reference position among
its competitors. According to system data from Banco de Portugal, as at 31 December 2019, BCP had
a market share of 17.1% of loans to customers (gross) and 17.8% of deposits in its domestic market.

As at the end of 2018, 742 credit institutions, mutual credit banks, saving banks and branches of credit
institutions were registered in Portugal, of which 150 were banks (Source: Banco de Portugal).
Financial institutions with head offices in the European Economic Area providing cross-border services
amounted to 1180, as at the end of 2018 (according to the last data available from Banco de Portugal).
Common indicators do not indicate levels of concentration significantly divergent from those of the
Eurozone. For instance, as of 2018, the total asset share of the five largest credit institutions represented
73% for Portugal, which is above Germany's 29% but below Greece with 97%, Estonia with 91%,
Lithuania with 91%, the Netherlands 85%, Cyprus with 88%, Finland with 82%, Latvia 81%, Croatia
with 79%, Malta 77% and Slovakia with 76% (Source: ECB).

The following table shows the development of the percentage of the Bank's market share in Portugal in

The Bank is also subject to strong competition in the international markets in which it operates.

The banking sector in Poland is characterised by a relatively low concentration sustaining strong
competitive pressure. However, significant opportunities have led to increased competition in recent
years, driven by privatisation and consolidation initiatives. In addition, in Poland, European Union
integration has created strong incentives for the cross-border provision of financial services and for
cross-border mergers, which have resulted in significantly increased competition from foreign banks.
As at September 2019, Bank Millennium's market share in Poland, according to the Bank's estimates
derived from data published by the National Bank of Poland, was 5.6% of loans to customers (gross)
and 6.2% of deposits.

In Mozambique, Millennium bim is the market leader with a market share of 19.9% of loans to
customers and 24.7% of deposits in September 2019, according to the Bank of Mozambique. Currently,
21 banks operate in Mozambique and management expects increasing competition from foreign banks,
particularly those based in South Africa and Portugal (Source: Bank of Mozambique).

Banco Millennium Angola merged with Banco Privado Atlântico, resulting in the second-largest private
sector bank in terms of loans to the economy, with a market share of approximately 10% by business
volume: market share above 10% in terms of loans and above 12% in terms of deposits (Source: Bank
of Angola).

**Trends Information**

_Portugal_

Portuguese banks will continue to operate in a challenging environment in 2020. Banks are operating
within a context of very low interest rates, exercising pressure on the net interest income. Moreover,
Portuguese Banks still have a significant number of non-interest bearing assets in their balance sheets.
In addition, the context is marked by fast technological evolution and, pursuant to the Payment Services
Directive 2 ("PSD2"), by the competition from new players in the market (Fintechs). There are also
new regulatory requirements, namely, as a result of the adoption of IFRS16 since January 2019.

As a result of the impact of the COVID-19, and following the economic lockdown, it is expected a
severe recession in Portugal's small and open economy. Besides, and despite the Government economic
stimulus measures, there could be also an impact in terms of the cost of risk.

At the end of 2019, all the rating agencies assigned an investment grade rating to the Portuguese
Republic, which, together with the improvement in the perception of the market vis-a-vis the Portuguese
economy, led to a sharp reduction in sovereign risk premiums and of banks.

In accordance with Banco de Portugal, Portuguese banks resort to the ECB in the amount of EUR 17.3
billion at the end of December 2019. There figures are consistent with the downwards trend in place
since the second half of 2013. These figures show an improvement in the liquidity position of the
domestic banks which has benefited from the resilient performance of deposits, namely from individuals
(+5.3% year-on-year in December 2019, with demand deposits up 8.8%).

Moreover, the deleveraging of the Portuguese financial sector continues and the total loans to
individuals increased 3.5% and loans to companies decreased 2.6%, year-on-year, respectively, in

174


-----

December 2019. The loans-to-deposits ratio of the banking sector in Portugal stood at 88% at the end
of September 2019 versus 128% at the end of 2012 and 158% at the end of 2010.

The loans granted by BCP continued to decrease but reflects two different dynamics: the NPE portfolio
decreased by EUR 1.3 billion in December 2019, year-on-year, and the performing portfolio increased
by EUR 5.0 billion, of which EUR 3.0 billion are related to the Eurobank acquisition (in Portugal: NPE
portfolio decreased by EUR 1.6 billion and performing portfolio increased by EUR 1.1 billion). At the
same time, deposits also continued to grow: +4.6% year-on-year, in Portugal, in December 2019. As
BCP has excess liquidity (loans-to-deposits ratio stood at 86% in December 2019), it decided to reduce
its use of net funding from the ECB to EUR 0.3 billion in December 2019.

At the end of December 2019, BCP was the largest Portuguese private sector bank, with a robust asset
structure, a fully implemented CET1 ratio of 12.2%, above regulatory requirements (SREP) and a loansto-deposits ratio of 86%.

The low level of interest rates is contributing to decrease the spread on term deposits of the Portuguese
banks, a trend which continued, albeit at a slower pace, in 2019, more than offsetting the lower spreads
in credit. The rates of the term deposits reached, by the end of December 2019, values around 10 basis
points, and the portfolio's average rate should converge to these levels over the course of next year.

The price effect on the net interest income should continue to be globally positive, translating the
improvement of the net interest income on operations with customers (differential between the loans
average rate and the average rate at which the banks remunerate the deposits). The profitability of the
Portuguese banks is expected to continue to be constrained by the prospects of continuation of a low
short term interest rates environment.

Several institutions should continue to apply restructuring plans, to increase operating efficiency and
the adjustment of business models, which translates into the decrease in the number of branches and
employees and in the release of capital allocated to non-core activities. Profitability in the banking
industry is still affected by a high NPE stock. Organic capital generation continues to be limited by the
low for longer interest rate environment which resulted in DTAs derecognition and downward revision
of the pension fund discount interest rate.

There is great focus on the management of the stock of problematic assets and respective coverage
levels by LLRs. BCP presented in 2018 a new Strategic Plan (Mobilising Millennium: 2021 Ambitions
and Strategic Plan) which includes a new target of NPEs reduction: 60% reduction of NPE stock,
reaching approximately EUR 3 billion by 2021.

_Poland_

Regarding mortgage loans granted by Bank Millennium in CHF, there are risks related to verdicts issued
by polish courts in individual lawsuits against banks (including Bank Millennium) raised by borrowers
of FX-indexed mortgage loans.

The vast majority of verdicts in lawsuits concerning Bank Millennium have been favourable to the Bank
so far. However, it should be noted that there is a significant risk that such favourable verdicts may
change, as a result of which pending lawsuits' verdicts may not be taken in accordance with the Bank's
expectation. If such risk materializes, it may have a significant negative impact on Bank Millennium.

On 3 October 2019, the CJEU issued a judgment on Case C-260/18, in connection with the preliminary
questions formulated by the District Court of Warsaw in the lawsuit against Raiffeisen Bank
International AG. The judgment of CJEU, as well as its interpretation of European Union Law, is
binding on domestic courts.

175


-----

CJEU's judgment concerns only the situations where the national court has previously found the contract
terms to be abusive. It is the exclusive competence of the national courts to assess, in the course of
judicial proceedings, whether a particular contract term can be identified as abusive in the circumstances
of the lawsuit. It can be reasonably assumed that the legal issues relating to FX-indexed mortgage loans
will be further examined by the national courts within the framework of the disputes considered, which
could possibly result in the emergence of further interpretations relevant for the assessment of the risks
associated with subject matter proceedings. This circumstance indicates the need for constant analysis
of these matters. Further requests for clarification and ruling addressed to the CJEU and the Supreme
Court of Poland with potential impact on the outcome of the court cases may also be filed

As at 2019, Bank Millennium had 2,010 FX-indexed mortgage loans subject to individual litigations,
submitted to the courts with the total value of claims filed by the plaintiffs amounting to PLN 203
million (EUR 47.74 million). Until 31 December 2019, only 19 of these cases had obtained a final
verdict, the vast majority being in accordance with the Bank's interest.

According to the Polish Bank Association (ZBP), during 2019, over 70% of the lawsuits regarding FXindexed mortgage loans obtained a final verdict favourable to the banks involved. However, after the
CJEU judgment regarding Case C-260/18 issued on 3 October 2019, there is a risk that this so far
positive scenario for the banks may change.

Considering the increased legal risk related to FX-indexed mortgages, Bank Millennium created a
provision in the amount of PLN 223 million (EUR 52.45 million) for legal risk. The methodology
developed by Bank Millennium is based on the following main parameters: (i) the number of current
(including class actions) and potential future court cases that will appear within a specified (three-year)
time horizon; (ii) the amount of Bank Millennium's potential loss in the event of a specific court
judgment (three negative judgment scenarios were taken into account); and, (iii) the probability of
obtaining a specific court verdict calculated on the basis of statistics of judgments of the banking sector
in Poland and legal opinions obtained. Variation in the level of provisions or concrete losses will
depend on the final court decisions about each case and on the number of court cases.

Bank Millennium undertakes a number of actions at different levels towards different stakeholders in
order to mitigate legal and litigation risk regarding the FX-indexed mortgage loans portfolio. Bank
Millennium is open to negotiate case-by-case favourable conditions for early repayment (partial or total)
or the conversion of loans to PLN. On the other hand, Bank Millennium will continue to take all
possible actions to protect its interests in courts while, at the same time, being open to find settlement
with customers in the court under reasonable conditions.

_Novo Banco_

It is not yet possible to determine what will be the final impact of the resolution of BES on BCP as an
institution participating in the resolution fund created by Decree-Law No. 31-A/2012, of 10 February
2012 (the "Resolution Fund").

The Resolution Fund disclosed on 17 June 2019 a set of clarifications related to the payment due in
2019 under the CCA with Novo Banco, namely:

For payments from the Resolution Fund to be made (limited to a maximum of EUR 3,890 million over
the lifetime of the mechanism), losses on the assets under the contingent mechanism should be incurred
and the capital ratios of Novo Banco should stand below the agreed reference thresholds;

The payment to be made by the Resolution Fund corresponds to the lower of the accumulated losses on
the assets covered and the amount necessary to restore the capital ratios above the minimum reference
threshold;

176


-----

The reference capital ratios are, in 2017, 2018 and 2019, linked to the regulatory requirements
applicable to Novo Banco (CET1 ratio of 11.25% and Tier 1 ratio of 12.75%), but, as from 2020, the
reference ratio will correspond to a CET1 ratio of 12%;

The initial reference value of the portfolio comprising the contingent capitalisation mechanism was as
of 30 June 2016 of EUR 7,838 million (book value of the associated assets, net of impairments), and
the value of the portfolio, as of 31 December 2018, amounted to approximately EUR 3,920 million
(book value, net of impairments);

The accumulated losses of the covered assets and their management, between 30 June 2016 (reference
date of the mechanism) and 31 December 2018, correspond to EUR 2,661 million. Of this amount, the
Resolution Fund paid in 2018, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the CCA, around EUR
792 million, hence, the amount of losses not borne by the Fund was, at the end of 2018, approximately
EUR 1,869 million;

The amount necessary to maintain the capital ratios of Novo Banco for 2018 at the agreed levels is EUR
1,149 million. The amount payable by the Resolution Fund results from a comparison between the
amount of EUR 1.869 million (accumulated loss on the covered assets not supported by the Fund) and
the amount of EUR 1,149 million, corresponding to the lower of those amounts, i.e. EUR 1,149 million.

On 24 May 2018, arising from the referred mechanism, the Resolution Fund paid EUR 792 million to
Novo Banco using its available financial resources from banking contributions (direct or indirect) and
complemented by a State loan of EUR 430 million under the terms agreed between the Portuguese State
and the Resolution Fund in October 2017. In its 2018 annual results press release, on 1 March 2019,
Novo Banco states that, in connection with the impact of losses related to the sale and write-downs of
legacy assets, Novo Banco will request a compensation of EUR 1,149 million under the existing CCA.
The Resolution Fund paid to Novo Banco on 6 May 2019 the calculated value relative to 2018 exercise
of EUR 1.149 million. For this purpose, the Resolution Fund used its own resources and also resorted
to a State loan of EUR 850 million, which corresponds to the annual maximum funding limit agreed
between the Resolution Fund and the State. The amount paid by the Resolution Fund to Novo Banco
in two years was EUR 1,941 million.

According to Novo Banco's 2019 earnings press release, Novo Banco will request a compensation of
EUR 1,037 million under the Contingent Capital Agreement (CCA), as stipulated in the sale agreement.
The amount of the compensation requested in 2017 and 2018 and to be requested relating to 2019 totals
EUR 2.98 billion. The maximum amount of compensation established in the CCA is EUR 3.89 billion.

As at 31 December 2019, Novo Banco is held by Lone Star and the Resolution Fund, corresponding to
75% and 25% of the share capital respectively.

_MREL_

On 30 October 2019, the Bank was notified by the Single Resolution Board of an updated MREL
requirement for the resolution group headed by the Bank, at a sub-consolidated level, which includes
the operations based in Portugal, Switzerland and Cayman, and excludes the operations based in
Mozambique and Poland (the "Resolution Group").

Based on financial information of the Resolution Group as at 31 December 2017, the Single Resolution
Board set the MREL requirement on a sub-consolidated basis for BCP at 14.99% of Total Liabilities
and Own Funds (“TLOF”), of which 9.95% shall be met with subordinated instruments, corresponding
to 25.98% of Total Risk Exposure Amount (“TREA”), of which 17.25% shall be met with subordinated
instruments. At the same time, the Bank was informed that the MREL requirement needs to be reached
by 1 July 2022 and from that date on shall be met at all times.

177


-----

On the same date, the Single Resolution Board (the "SRB") also notified BCP, as head of the Resolution
Group, that Banco ActivoBank, S.A. shall comply with MREL on an individual basis at the level of
7.61% of its TLOF, corresponding to 19.36% of its TREA. This requirement shall be reached by 1 July
2022 and maintained at all times from that date on.

These MREL requirements and the corresponding deadlines will need to be revised with the entering
in force of BRRD II (as defined below). Banks are expected to be provided with revised MREL targets
(including the interim ones) during the first quarter of 2021 as a result of the 2020 planning cycle.

On 1 April 2020, the SRB made public a letter sent on 25 March 2020 to CEOs of banks under its
supervision stating, among other matters that, "The SRB will carefully monitor the market conditions
in the next months and analyse the potential impact on transition periods needed for the build-up of
MREL. The SRB is ready to use its discretion and the flexibility given by the regulatory framework to
adapt transition periods and interim targets applied to banking groups, as well as to adjust MREL targets
in line with capital requirements, with particular reference to capital buffers".

Moreover, and taking into account the potential impacts for banks of the COVID-19 crisis, on 8 April
2020, Elke Konig, chairman of the SRB, provided further clarity regarding the future revision of MREL
targets stating that the SRB is committed to ensuring that short-term MREL constraints do not prevent
banks from lending to business and the real economy.

_COVID-19 Pandemic_

A widespread global pandemic of the severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (commonly known as
SARS-CoV-2) and of the infectious disease COVID-19, caused by the virus, is currently taking place
worldwide, affecting the lives of a large portion of the global population.

The range of implications of this pandemic is not yet fully determined but it is already foreseeable that
it will have a material adverse impact on the Portuguese economy, as well as on the economies of all
other jurisdictions in which the BCP Group operates.

The COVID-19 pandemic is leading to an adverse economic shock, with very substantial effects on
business activities. Therefore, the Portuguese economy is forecasted to undergo a significant
deterioration as a result of the pandemic. On 26 March 2020, the Bank of Portugal announced that the
recession of the Portuguese economy in 2020 could be between -3.7% in a baseline scenario and -5.7%
in an adverse scenario (Source: Bank of Portugal, Economic Bulletin, 26 March 2020). In 14 April
2020, the IMF announced that it expected a more severe recession, with a contraction of -8% of the
Portuguese GDP in 2020 (Source: IMF, WEO, April 2020), as the pandemic and the necessary
lockdown measures had aggravated. In 2021, both institutions foresee a gradual recovery of the
Portuguese economy. However, there is heightened uncertainty underlying this scenario and the
possibility of the impact of the pandemic crisis may assume a more persistent nature as a result of the
destruction of installed productive capacity.

The pandemic has led to the declaration of state of emergency in various countries, including Portugal,
as well as the imposition of travel restrictions, the establishment of quarantines and the temporary
shutdown of various institutions and businesses and several institutions have taken unprecedented
measures, such as having the vast majority of its employees now working remotely.

The BCP Group is following a "Contingency Plan" adapted to the pandemic scenario, which has been
updated specifically for the current crisis, and has created a specific Crisis Management Office for this
effect. In this context, in line with the guidelines issued by the authorities and supervisory entities, the
Bank has defined an action plan aimed at protecting customers and employees, mitigating the

178


-----

probability of contagion and ensuring the operational continuity of the business. Guidance was also
issued to service providers.

The Contingency Plan comprehends, among others, the following measures:

- Communication to employees of mitigation measures and information about the virus that aim
to safeguard employees and the entire surrounding community, as well as ensuring that the
business activity maintains the service levels that customers expect from the Bank;

- National and foreign travel for work should only occur in exceptional cases. National or foreign
trips for personal reasons and using air transport are not recommended;

- Whenever possible, meetings by videoconference or conference calls should be the preferred
option;

- Employees must limit some of their social habits, such as minimising physical contact;

- Employees who have been abroad in the past 14 days should inform their hierarchy and their
Human Resources Manager to assess the need for additional protection measures;

- Distribution of masks and procedures on when and how to use them;

- Daily monitoring of absent employees;

- Physical segregation of the workspace to minimize the risk of spreading the virus and
implementing remote work for part of the teams.

- A significant proportion of employees are currently working remotely to reduce physical
contact.

The Contingency Plan may be amended and/or supplemented as the situation evolves. The Crisis
Management Office monitors the evolution of the situation and, if necessary, will implement new
actions.

Measures were already implemented by the Portuguese Government and the Bank has also announced
voluntary measures to address the impact of the pandemic which have an impact on the Bank. Further
potential measures may be implemented by the Portuguese Government and the Bank which can also
have an impact on the Bank.

The Portuguese Government announced a 6-month moratorium (for the avoidance of doubt it does not
imply a cancellation or pardon of any amount) on loan payments (capital and/or interest) until 30
September 2020 (Decree-Law No. 10-J/2020). The moratorium is available for individuals and
companies that are not in the financial sector, depending on the fulfilment of certain conditions. DecreeLaw No. 10-J/2020 also foresees the granting of guarantees by the Portuguese State, including to nonfinancial corporate entities, subject to certain conditions.

To help families and businesses overcome the economic challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,
BCP has launched a set of measures worth a total of EUR 4.7 billion.

As regards individuals the main measures include:

- Interest and capital moratorium for mortgages until the end of September 2020, under the terms
announced in Decree-Law No. 10-J/2020;

179


-----

- Suspension of spread changes in the case of non-compliance with contractual conditions;

- Integrated Solutions ("account packs") for just EUR 1 / month until September 2020;

- Health, disability and death insurance with coverage for COVID-19.

As regards companies, BCP will reinforce credit for cash management and immediate liquidity, with
factoring and confirming products, as well as providing the possibility of accessing several credit lines.
This plan aims to support the economy, protect employment and strengthen business sustainability. The
main measures are:

- Interest and capital moratorium for loans until the end of September 2020, under the terms
announced in Decree-Law No. 10-J/2020;

- Reinforcement of cash management credit and immediate liquidity;

- Sociedade de Garantia Mútua guaranteed credit lines up to EUR 6.2 billion;

- EUR 1 billion in credit lines with European guarantees from the European Investment Fund
and European Investment Bank;

- 500 million euros in factoring and confirming;

- Financing with extended payment of corporate taxes;

- Discounting of public sector invoices and advance payments from the State;

- Launch of Millennium Help Empresas, a specialised technical support line for corporate
customers.

It is not possible at this stage to assess all the specific measures that may be implemented to curb the
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Summary of the developments between 2011 and 2019 of some relevant indicators of the Bank[23]**

The Bank has successfully executed an operational turnaround, reinforcing its financial and capital
position despite adverse market conditions in the Portuguese banking sector. This position is reflected
by achievements such as the reduction of the commercial gap from EUR 20.5 billion at 31 December
2011 to EUR -8.6 billion at 31 December 2019, following a significant deleveraging (net loans
decreased by 23% and deposits increased by 28%), a recovery of net interest income in Portugal from
EUR 343 million to EUR 803 million in 2018 and EUR 789 million in 2019, a reduction of operating
costs from EUR 853 million in 2013 to EUR 614 million in 2018 and EUR 674 million in 2019 and a
reduction of cost of risk from 157 bp in 2013 to 76 in the end of December 2019. Pre-provision profit[24]
increased from EUR 474 million in 2013 to EUR 1,159 million in 2018 and EUR 1,169 million in 2019.
As a percentage of assets pre-provision profit increased from 0.6% in 2013 to 1.5% in 2018 and to 1.4%

23 In this section, the terms listed below shall have the following meaning:

in 2019. As a result of the significant deleveraging, reliance on ECB funding has decreased from EUR
10 billion in 2013 to EUR 0.3 billion as at 31 December 2019.

The Balance sheet breakdown as at 31 December 2019 is, on the assets side: gross loans and advances
to customers (including debt securities and commercial paper) in the amount of EUR 54.7 billion (EUR
52.3 billion recorded in "Loans and advances to customers"; EUR 2.1 billion recorded in "Debt
securities held associated with credit operations" and EUR 0.372 billion (gross amount without
considering fair value adjustments) recorded in "Financial assets not held for trading mandatorily at fair
value through profit or loss - Loans and advances to customers at fair value"), securities portfolio
(including financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and financial assets at fair value through
other comprehensive income and debt securities held not associated with credit operations) in the
amount of EUR 15.6 billion and other assets net in the amount of EUR 5.0 billion; and on the liabilities
side: deposits in the amount of EUR 60.8 billion (of which EUR 59.1 at the amortised cost), money
market net (the difference between resources from credit institutions and cash and deposits at central
banks, loans to credit institutions and loan agreements) in the amount of EUR -1.8 billion, debt issued
by the Bank in the amount of EUR 6.4 billion and shareholders' equity in the amount of EUR 7.4 billion.
The Balance sheet breakdown as at 31 December 2011, is on the assets side: loans and advances to
customers in the amount of EUR 68.0 billion, securities in the amount of EUR 12.1 billion and other
assets net in the amount of EUR 3.2 billion; and on the liabilities side: deposits in the amount of EUR
47.5 billion, money market net in the amount of EUR 12.9 billion, debt issued by the Bank in the amount
of EUR 18.5 billion and shareholders' equity in the amount of EUR 4.4 billion.

The breakdown by instrument of the outstanding amounts of the debt issued by the Bank as at 31
December 2019 (EUR 6.4 billion) is as follows (which are recorded in the captions "Financial liabilities
at amortised cost – non subordinated debt securities issued", "Financial liabilities at amortised cost –
subordinated debt" and "Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss"): MTN (EUR 0.9
billion), Bonds and Certificates (EUR 1.1 billion), Covered Bonds (EUR 1.0 billion), Securitisations
(EUR 0.2 billion), Subordinated debt (EUR 1.5 billion) and Loan agreements (EUR 1.8 billion). As at
31 December 2011, the breakdown by instrument of the outstanding amounts of the debt issued by the
Bank (EUR 18.5 billion) was as follows: MTN (EUR 7.6 billion), Bonds and Certificates (EUR 4.1
billion), Covered Bonds (EUR 3.3 billion), Securitisations (EUR 1.2 billion), Subordinated debt (EUR
1.1 billion) and Loan agreements (EUR 1.2 billion).

The amount of the debt outstanding repaid from 2011-2016 was on average EUR 2.3 billion per year,
the same amount as in 2017 (EUR 2.3 billion of debt repaid), EUR 0.8 billion of debt repaid in 2018
and EUR 0.4 billion of debt repaid in 2019. The amount of debt to be repaid in in the years after 2019
amounts to EUR 6.4 billion. Future debt repayments (medium-long term) are significantly lower than
in the past.

The securities portfolio totalled EUR 12.1 billion as at December 2011 of which EUR 7.3 billion is
sovereign debt (Portuguese Government Bonds totalled EUR 4.7 billion of which EUR 3.0 billion are
Bonds and EUR 1.7 billion are T-Bills, Polish Government Bonds totalled EUR 0.8 billion;
Mozambican long-term Government Bonds totalled EUR 0.3 billion and other totalled EUR 1.5 billion)
and EUR 4.8 billion other instruments. The securities portfolio totalled EUR 15.6 billion as at 31
December 2019 of which EUR 12.9 billion is sovereign debt (Portuguese Government Bonds totalled

**Recent developments on the banking regulation**

**_Regulatory requirements_**

_Capital requirements:_

On 12 September 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision announced a new capital
agreement on banking supervision known as Basel III, which revises most of the capital and liquidity
minimum requirements. The Basel III framework sets out enhanced standards to strengthen financial
institutions' capital base, improve risk management and governance, and increase transparency for
market participants. It builds on the Basel II three-pillar architecture, according to which: (i) Pillar 1
(minimum prudential requirements) sets the binding minimum level of capital banks and investment
firms need to face major risks; (ii) Pillar 2 (supervisory review) allows supervisors to evaluate
institution-specific risks and impose additional capital charges to face them; (iii) Pillar 3 (market
discipline) aims to increase transparency in banks' financial reporting allowing marketplace participants
to better reward well-managed banks.

CRD IV empowers the European Banking Authority to draw up regulatory technical standards that
specify some of the aspects covered by the amended diplomas. Upon the respective adoption by the
European Commission these norms are directly applicable under Portuguese law. Guidelines are
subject to their adoption by the Competent Authority.

Under the guidance of the Single Supervisory Mechanism ("SSM"), the conclusions of the supervisory
review take the form of prudential requirements (Pillar 2) being set to be held in excess of the minimum
capital requirements (Pillar 1). Banks are required to maintain a total capital requirement that includes
CET1 instruments and other capital instruments and are also subject to the overall capital requirement
that also includes the combined own funds buffer requirement.

The supervision of internal models is based on current applicable EU and national law, including CRR,
the relevant regulatory technical standards of the EBA and EBA guidelines with which the ECB has
announced its intention to comply. The internal risk models that the Bank has implemented are
supervised and monitored continuously by the supervisory authorities, with whom the Bank maintains
a regular dialogue on the matter. Adjustments to those models, with a view to their better calibration
in light of possible context changes, requested by the supervisory authorities or as a result of the Bank's
initiative, or related to new regulation implementation may have an impact on the amount of risk
weighted assets ("RWA"), and, consequently, affect the capital ratios of the Bank. The revised
regulatory framework of Basel III was implemented in the EU through the adoption of Regulation
575/2013/EU of the European parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013, as amended, on prudential
requirements ("CRR") and Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26
June 2013, as amended, on access to the activity of credit institutions on prudential requirements ("CRD
**IV"). The CRD IV package is comprised of a directive (CRD IV) governing the access to banking**
activity, and a regulation (CRR) establishing how to calculate the amount of capital that banks and
investment firms must set aside; it also lays down requirements on reporting and liquidity.

The CRR is directly applicable to Member States since January 2014 and includes the following
provisions in addition to the minimum capital requirement for CET1 capital of 4.5% of RWA, of 6%
for Tier 1 capital ratio and the total capital ratio of 8.0%:

(i) an additional capital conservation ratio requirement of 2.5% over common equity;

(ii) a countercyclical capital buffer, which will be between 0.0% and 2.5% of RWA with the ability
to absorb losses as a function of the credit cycle subject to its application by national
supervisory authorities;

185


-----

(iii) a systemic risk buffer and a buffer for other systemically important institution; and

(iv) the leverage ratio of 3.0%

On 23 November 2014, Decree-Law No. 157/2014, of 24 October 2014 ("Decree-Law No. 157/2014"),
entered into force, amending the Legal Framework of Credit Institutions and Financial Companies, and
implementing CRD IV and CRR at domestic level.

On 1 January 2018, Regulation (EU) 2017/2395 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 12
December 2017, entered into force, amending the CRR as regards transitional arrangements for
mitigating the impact of the introduction of IFRS 9 on own funds and for the large exposures treatment
of certain public sector exposures denominated in the domestic currency of any Member State.

The banking package approved by the Council in May 2019 implements further material elements of
the Basel III framework (Basel IV), which was finalised on December 2017, by the way of amendments
to the CRR ("CRR II") and CRD IV ("CRD V"), the BRRD ("BRRD II") and the SSM Regulation
("SRMR II").

This legislative package includes revised rules on calculating capital requirements for market risk,
("Fundamental review of the banking book"), introduction of a binding leverage ratio and a binding net
stability funding ratio ("NSFR") and streamlining Pillar 2 capital requirements. This legislative
package also adjusts the MREL. The above Regulations and Directives entered into force on 27 June
2019. The amendments to the CRR are to be applied for the first time two years after entry into force
(subject to certain earlier applications and exemptions, such as those relating to the transitional
arrangements for IFRS 9 and the characteristics of new regulatory capital instruments), while the new
CRD V rules are to be applied 18 months after entry into force, with application immediately thereafter.
Member States shall adopt and publish, by 28 December 2020, the measures necessary to comply with
the Directives.

On 7 December 2017, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision reached an agreement on the
remaining Basel III reforms ("Basel IV"). Basel IV, which paves the way for CRR III and CRD VI as
they are to be transposed to European law, aims at reducing excessive variability of RWA. The agreed
reforms address the following topics:

(i) Improvement of the standardised approaches for credit risk;

(ii) Constraints to the use of internal models: banks may, for example, for their exposures to large
and mid-sized corporates no longer use own estimates for two parameters (the loss-givendefault and exposure at default) but rather use fixed values instead. Moreover, after the reform,
internal ratings-based approaches will no longer be allowed for exposures to equities;

(iii) Improvement of the operational risk framework: current approaches are replaced with a single
risk-sensitive standardised approach to be used by all banks; internal models will no longer be
allowed to address losses that stem from misconduct, inadequate systems and controls, etc.;

(iv) Introduction of a different output floor set at 72.5% introducing a limit to the regulatory capital
benefits that a bank using internal models can derive compared to the standardised approaches;

(v) Revised procedure for calculating credit valuation adjustments (CVAs) in derivatives

On January 2019 the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published the revised standards for
minimum capital requirements for Market Risk (Fundamental Review of the Trading Book – "FRTB")
introducing deep changes to the framework and calibration of internal models and standardized models
used for the calculation of own funds requirements for this type of risk.

186


-----

The revised standardised approach, internal models, operational risk framework, and leverage ratio for
G-SIIs shall all become applicable as of 1 January 2022. The output floor will be phased-in and will
only become fully effective as of January 2027 (2022: 50%, 2023: 55%, 2024: 60%, 2025: 65%, 2026:
70% and 2027: 72.5%). However, in addition, supervisors may at national discretion cap the increase
in a bank's total RWA that results from the application of the output floor during its phase-in period.

Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the Basel Committee's oversight body, the Group of Central Bank
Governors and Heads of Supervision, has endorsed a set of measures to provide additional operational
capacity for banks and supervisors to respond to the immediate financial stability priorities resulting
from the impact of the coronavirus.

These measures comprise the following changes to the implementation timeline of the outstanding
Basel III standards:

- The implementation date of the Basel III standards finalised in December 2017 has been deferred
by one year to 1 January 2023. The accompanying transitional arrangements for the output floor
has also been extended by one year to 1 January 2028.

- The implementation date of the revised market risk framework finalised in January 2019 has been
deferred by one year to 1 January 2023.

- The implementation date of the revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements finalised in December 2018
has been deferred by one year to 1 January 2023.

As at 31 December 2019, the Bank's fully implemented CET1 ratio was 12.2%. Starting from the "Total
Equity attributable to the Banks shareholders" (EUR 6,120 million), deducting EUR 361 million of
DTAs, EUR 130 million of EL gap and deducting EUR 133 of other items one reaches to the CET1
which as at 31 December 2019 stood at EUR 5,496 million.

The capital ratio has increased from 6.4% at the end of December 2009 to 9.3% at the end of December
2011 (both figures refer to the CT1 ratio calculated according to the definition of Banco de Portugal)
and to 11.1% at the end of December 2016, 11.9% at the end of December 2017 and 12.0% at the end
of December 2018 and 12.2% at the end of December 2019 (these three figures refer to CET1 fully
implemented ratio, calculated according to CRD IV and CRR).

_Capital buffers: The criteria for maintenance by credit institutions and certain investment companies of_
additional own funds' buffers include:

(b) a capital conservation buffer;

(c) the institution's specific countercyclical capital buffer;

(d) the systemic risk buffer, also referred to as SII buffer; and

(e) an O-SII buffer (for other systemically important institutions at a national level).

The combined buffer requirement with which each institution is required to comply corresponds to the
sum of the capital conservation buffer, the institution-specific countercyclical capital buffer, and the
higher of the O-SII buffer and the systemic risk buffer (except where the latter only applies to risk
exposures in the Member State which activated the measure, in which case it is additive).

These measures have the objective of safeguarding financial stability, by strengthening the resilience
of the financial sector and preventing systemic risk. The set of instruments and intermediate objectives
will be revised and adjusted by the competent authorities where necessary to better safeguard financial

187


-----

stability. In addition, other macroprudential policy instruments may be activated if deemed necessary.
Failure to comply with these buffers implies restrictions on distributions relating to CET1 own funds
as well as an obligation to submit to the competent authorities a capital conservation plan within 5
business days of the breach.

_Capital conservation buffer: The capital conservation buffer requirement aims to accommodate losses_
from a potential adverse scenario The Bank has a requirement (at an individual and consolidated level)
to maintain a minimum CET1 capital buffer of 2.5%, as provided in Article 23 of Decree-Law No.
157/2014.

_Countercyclical buffer: The countercyclical capital buffer is one of the main macroprudential_
instruments introduced by the new regulatory framework, aiming to improve the banking system's
resilience to periods of excessive credit growth. The establishment of variable capital requirements
over the cycle is expected to contribute to mitigating the pro-cyclicality of banks' credit policies. The
following apply to this buffer:

(i) the rate will be set between 0% and 2.5% of the total risk exposure amount;

(ii) the rate is calibrated in steps of 0.25 percentage points or multiples of 0.25 percentage points;
and

(iii) in exceptional cases, the rate may be set at a level above 2.5%.

The buffer rate for each institution, known as the "institution-specific countercyclical buffer rate", is a
weighted average of the countercyclical buffer rates that apply in the countries where the credit
exposures of that institution are located. This requirement is met with CET1 capital. Under the SSM,
the ECB can propose higher minimum capital requirements than the ones defined by the national
authorities. This capital buffer will apply to all credit risk exposures, with credit exposures to the
domestic private non-financial sector, of credit institutions and investment firms subject to the
supervision of Banco de Portugal or the ECB (SSM), as applicable.

The countercyclical buffer rate for credit exposures to the domestic counterparties (Portugal) will
remain at zero % of the total risk exposure amount in effect since 1 April 2020. This decision is
reviewed on a quarterly basis by Banco de Portugal, the next decision to be taken by 30June 2020. As
at 31 March 2020 the weighted average of the countercyclical buffer rates that apply in the countries
where the Bank is located was also zero %.

On 15 April 2020, the ECB released a statement supporting the macroprudential policy actions taken
by euro area macroprudential authorities in response to coronavirus outbreak. These included releases
or reductions of the countercyclical capital buffer, systemic risk buffer and buffers for O-SII. In
addition, some authorities have postponed or revoked earlier announced measures.

_Systemic risk buffer: In order to calculate the systemic risk buffer, Banco de Portugal categorises_
institutions as global systemically important institution ("G-SII") or other systemically important
institution ("O-SII"). Banco de Portugal can also impose a systemic risk buffer of CET1 capital on an
individual, sub-consolidated or consolidated basis of at least 1% of the risk exposure to which such
buffer is applicable, to prevent or reduce the long-term non-cyclic systemic or macroprudential risks
that present a risk of disruption in the financial system and the Portuguese economy.

A G-SII could face additional requirements. Although it is currently not anticipated that Portuguese
banks may be classified as G-SIIs, there is no assurance that this will not change in the future. The
Bank is currently classified as an O-SII, and as such it is subject to concurrent additional capital
requirements. The O-SII buffer rates range from 0.25% to 1% of the total risk exposure (maximum

188


-----

level of 2%) and consists of CET1 capital on a consolidated basis. The cap on the O-SII buffer rate of
2% has been lifted with CRD V to 3%, subject to the approval of the European Commission. These
buffers are revised each year or in the event of a significant restructuring process, particularly, a merger
or acquisition.

On 29 November 2019, Banco de Portugal disclosed that it had conducted the annual reassessment of
the list of institutions identified as O-SIIs and the respective capital buffers. The O-SII buffer applicable
to BCP increased by 25 basis points to 1.00% to be in force starting 1 January 2022.

Following the pandemic outbreak, on 8 May 2020, Banco de Portugal decided to postpone the phasein period by 1 year of the capital buffer for O-SII, changing the end of the phase-in period of BCP from
1 January 2022 to 1 January 2023 (0.56% in 2020 and 2021, 0.75% in 2022 and 1.00% in 2023).

_Leverage ratio_

The leverage ratio is a (non-risk-sensitive) measure of a bank's ability to meet its long-term financial
obligations, calculated by dividing the Bank's Tier 1 capital by its average total consolidated assets and
expressed as a percentage.

CRD V introduces a binding leverage ratio minimum requirement of 3%. Under the new CRD V rules,
additional leverage ratio requirements can be imposed to address the institution-specific risk of
excessive leverage. G-SII will be required to hold an additional leverage ratio buffer in the future,
amounting to 50% of the risk-based G-SII capital buffer. It is not anticipated that Portuguese banks
may be classified as G-SIIs. These changes deriving from CRR II, except for the G-SII, are to be
applied for the first time two years after CRR II enters into force. Currently, the Leverage ratio only
has to be reported to the supervisor and disclosed publicly.

The Bank's leverage ratio was 7.0% fully implemented, as at 31 December 2019.

_Liquidity requirements_

Basel III and CRD IV and CRR, provide for the setting of short- and long-term liquidity ratios and
funding ratios, namely the LCR and the NSFR. The NSFR, currently a mere reporting obligation will
become binding following CRD V.

The Bank's LCR calculated in accordance with the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61,
of 10 October 2014, and the NSFR, estimated in accordance with Basel III methodology that supported
the ECB's Short-Term Exercise report, were 216% and 135%, respectively, as at 31 December 2019,
higher than the reference value of 100% (fully implemented).

The LCR requires that banks have sufficient high-quality liquid assets ("HQLA") in their liquidity
buffer to cover the difference between the expected cash outflows and the expected capped cash inflows
over a 30-day stressed period. The value of the ratio is to be no lower than 100% (the stock of HQLAs
should at least equal total net cash outflows). In relation to the LCR, the EBA:

(i) defined assets as 'extremely high' and of 'high' quality;

(ii) put in place operational requirements for the holdings of liquid assets;

(iii) recommended that all types of bonds issued or guaranteed by Member States' central
governments and central banks in local currency as well as those issued or guaranteed by
supranational institutions should be considered transferrable extremely high-quality assets;

189


-----

(iv) stated that the credit quality standards and eligibility of covered bonds, bonds, RMBS and bonds
issued by local government entities should be considered highly liquid and credit quality assets;
and

(v) recommended that common equity shares should be considered high quality liquid assets.

The NSFR, is defined as the amount of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable
funding. This ratio should be equal to at least 100% on an on-going basis. "Available stable funding"
is defined as the portion of capital and liabilities expected to be reliable over the time horizon considered
by the NSFR, which extends to one year. The ratio aims at ensuring that the funding of illiquid assets
is made through stable sources, both in normal as well as adverse conditions.

**_Response to the COVID-19 crisis_**

_ECB Banking Supervision provides temporary capital and operational relief in reaction to the COVID-_
_19 crisis_

On 12 and 20 March 2020, the ECB announced several measures to support banks.

The ECB will allow banks to operate temporarily below the level of capital defined by the Pillar 2
Guidance, the capital conservation buffer and the liquidity coverage ratio ("LCR"). The ECB also
clarified that capital buffers may be used in full and that no negative judgment will be attached to those
making use of these relief measures. Once this period of financial distress is over banks will be granted
sufficient time to build up the buffers again.

Banks will also be allowed to partially use capital instruments that do not qualify as CET1 capital, for
example Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 instruments, to meet the P2R. This brings forward a measure that
was initially scheduled to come into effect in January 2021, as part of the latest revision of the CRD V.

In addition, the ECB has taken individual measures, such as adjusting timetables, processes and
deadlines (e.g. rescheduling on-site inspections and extending deadlines for the implementation of
remediation actions stemming from recent on-site inspections and internal model investigations;
extending deadlines for certain non-critical supervisory measures and data requests). Banco de Portugal
clarified some of these measures through Carta Circular 2020/00000017 and 2020/00000021.

The ECB has supported the decision by the EBA to postpone the 2020 EBA EU-wide stress test.

Banks are expected not to increase dividend distributions or variable remuneration.

On 16 April 2020, the ECB Banking Supervision provided temporary relief for capital requirements for
market risk by allowing banks to adjust the supervisory component of these requirements.

_Banking Package to help mitigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic_

On 28 April 2020, the European Commission adopted a banking package to help mitigate the economic
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

- CRR

In this regard, the following set of amendments to the CRR have been proposed:

(i) transitional arrangements for mitigating the impact of IFRS 9 provisions on regulatory capital,
namely the extension of the current transitional arrangements in the CRR by two years, in line

190


-----

with the international agreement of the Basel Committee. Only provisions incurred as of 1
January 2020 would be eligible;

(ii) date of application of the leverage ratio buffer for G-SIIs is proposed to be deferred by one year
to 1 January 2023; and

(iii) more favourable treatment of publicly guaranteed loans under the NPL prudential backstop,
namely by temporarily extending preferential treatment to NPLs guaranteed by the public sector
in the context of measures aimed at mitigating the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
in accordance with EU State aid rules.

- IFRS 9

The banking package also includes an Interpretative Communication on the EU's accounting and
prudential frameworks which has clarified:

(i) the flexibility available in IFRS 9 as regards (i) the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) approach under
IFRS 9; (ii) the Assessment of a "Significant Increase in Credit Risk" (SICR) and (iii) the use
of moratoria and "Significant Increase in Credit Risk";

(ii) that individual or corporate loans that benefit from moratoria should not automatically be
considered to have suffered a "Significant Increase in Credit Risk" if they have become subject
to private or public moratoria. As such, if they fulfil a number of conditions (as specified in the
EBA guidelines of 2 April 2020 on payment moratoria, EBA/GL/2020/02) they are not
considered as forbearance measures and therefore do not affect the classification of the loans
concerned; and

(iii) how the prudential rules on the classification of NPLs (definition of default and loan
forbearance under the CRR) can accommodate Government guarantees and payment moratoria
in line with the statements and guidance by the EBA and the ECB.

- Other measures

The banking package also envisages the following measures:

(i) advancing the date of application of the revised supporting factor for SME and the new
supporting factor for infrastructure finance, the preferential treatment of certain software assets,
and the preferential treatment of certain loans backed by pensions or salaries; and

(ii) a proposal for the modification of the offsetting mechanism associated with competent
authorities’ discretion to allow credit institutions to temporarily exclude exposures in the form
of central bank reserves from the calculation of the leverage ratio.

**_Banking Union_**

In an effort to harmonise the regulation and supervision of banking activities across the European Union
and especially in the Eurozone, the European Commission established a new common regulation
(Single Rule Book) and a common supervisory architecture (European Supervisor Authorities together
with Nacional Competent Authorities. The key-elements of the Banking Union are the Single
Supervisory Mechanism ("SSM"), the SRM and the European Deposits Insurance Scheme ("EDIS"):

(iii) The SSM, which assigns the role of direct banking sector supervisor to the ECB in order to
ensure that the largest banks in Europe are independently supervised under common rules
(operating since 4 November 2014);

191


-----

(iv) The SRM, which is responsible for planning for the worst-case scenario, namely the failure of
a bank, to ensure that the situation can be resolved in an orderly manner;

(v) On 24 November 2015, the European Commission presented a legislative proposal that aims to
add another element to the Banking Union, the EDIS, which is to be built on the basis of existing
national Deposit Guarantee Schemes ("DGS"), but yet to be implemented.

Furthermore, the underlying resolution rules were changed through the provisions of the BRRD,
according to which resolutions shall mainly be financed by banks' shareholders and creditors. Where
necessary, financing can also be provided, on a complementary basis, by the newly established Single
Resolution Fund (the "SRF"), which is financed by the European banking industry. The SRF is only
expected to reach its target funding level in 2023. Members of the Eurozone are automatically part of
the Banking Union, while other Member States may opt in.

_The Single Supervisory Mechanism_

The Banking Union assigns specific tasks to the ECB concerning policies relating to the prudential
supervision of credit institutions. According to the regulation, the SSM is intended to ensure that the
European Union policy relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions is implemented in a
coherent and effective manner, that the single rulebook for financial services is applied in the same
manner to credit institutions in all Member States concerned and that those credit institutions are subject
to supervision of the highest quality, unfettered by other non-prudential considerations.

The ECB directly supervises approximately 120 financial institutions, including (since 4 November
2014) the Bank, that are considered to be systemically relevant, given their dimension and importance
in the banking system of each Member State. The ECB's supervision of the approximately 6,000 other
financial entities is exercised in conjunction with national authorities. The "SSM Regulation" and the
"SSM Framework Regulation" provide the legal basis for the operational arrangements of the SSM.

The SSM is also responsible for regularly assessing and measuring the risks for each bank and,
consequently, the capital and liquidity adequacy of credit institutions through the global evaluation of
own funds adequacy, by means of the SREP:

(vi) During the SREP, the supervisor not only defines banks' capital requirements, (e.g. Pillar 2
capital requirements – ("P2R") and Pillar 2 capital guidance ("P2G")), but may also decide to
impose additional measures on banks, including liquidity and qualitative measures;

(vii) The prudential requirements require banks to maintain a total SREP capital requirement
("TSCR") that includes CET1 instruments and other capital instruments;

(viii) Banks are also subject to the overall capital requirement ("OCR") that includes, in addition to
the TSCR, additional capital buffers, namely "the combined buffer", comprised of the
countercyclical capital buffer, capital conservation buffer and systemic buffer, as described
above; and

(ix) The P2G is to be made up entirely of CET1 capital and should be held over and above the OCR.
Failure to comply with the P2G is not itself a breach of own funds requirements, but it may be
subject to additional measures adjusted to the individual situation of the bank. The P2G is not
relevant for purposes of the Minimum Distributable Amount ("MDA"). The MDA is the
maximum amount a bank is allowed to pay out, for example for bonuses or dividends. A bank
whose capital ratio falls below the MDA trigger point faces restrictions on the amount of
distributable profits.

192


-----

During the SREP, the supervisor not only defines banks' capital requirements but may also decide to
impose additional measures on banks, including liquidity and qualitative measures. The final measures
to be adopted will be assessed, on a case-by-case basis, by the Supervisory Board of the ECB.

CRD V clarifies the conditions for imposing Pillar 2 additional requirements, i.e., the institutionspecific nature of Pillar 2 add-ons makes them unsuitable for macro-prudential purposes, for which
other specific tools are set out. It also clarifies the interaction between the Pillar 2 add-ons, the Pillar 1
requirements, the own funds and eligible liabilities requirement, the MREL and the combined buffers
(the 'stacking order') while clarifying the distinction between Pillar 2 requirements imposed by
supervisors to address institution-specific actual risks and (non-binding) P2G, which refers to the
possibility for competent authorities to indicate to banks the level of capital in excess of Pillar 1, Pillar
2 and combined buffers requirements that they expect them to hold to face forward-looking and remote
stresses.

The EBA issues guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for the SREP. These guidelines
introduce consistent methodologies for the assessment of risks to capital and risks to liquidity, and for
the assessment of the Bank's capital and liquidity adequacy. Changes to guidelines, after being endorsed
by the competent authorities may also have implications on the Bank's compliance of supervisory
requirements.

_The Single Resolution Mechanism_

A new recovery and resolution regime introduced tools and powers aimed at addressing banking crisis
in advance through Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May
2014, as amended, established a framework for recovery and resolution ("BRRD"). The SRM,
establishes uniform rules and procedures for the resolution of credit institutions (the "SRM
**Regulation") regarding the loss-absorbing and recapitalisation capacity.**

The BRRD was implemented in Portugal through Law No. 23-A/2015, of 26 March 2015, as amended
(which amended the Banking Law).

In the event of a bank's critical financial condition ("fail or likely to fail"), the Banking Union's
framework was designed to minimise the impact of any particular bank's financial difficulties on the
financial system and on taxpayers. Under the envisaged SRM, shareholders of the institution would be
the first to bear losses, before that institution's lenders in accordance with the applicable creditor
hierarchy set out under applicable legislation. To that end, resolution authorities were given the power
to allocate losses to shareholders and creditors (including holders of any Notes) (the "bail in" tool, as
per Article 43 of the BRRD), in line with the valuation of the failing business and according to the
sequence provided in Article 48 of the BRRD. Shareholders and creditors must therefore absorb losses
for at least 8% of their total liabilities, including own funds, before any use of the resolution fund.

Guaranteed deposits are expected to be safeguarded and creditors should not bear losses greater than
those that they would have suffered had the institution been liquidated under ordinary insolvency
proceedings. The BRRD contemplates that subordinated liabilities (such as the Subordinated Notes)
may be subject to non-viability loss absorption, in addition to the application of the general bail-in tool
(which may apply to any of the Notes).

As such, the Banking Union and, in particular, the use of resolution tools and powers provided for by
the Banking Union may disrupt the rights of shareholders and creditors. In particular, the power of the
authorities to transfer the shares or all or part of the assets of an institution to a private purchaser without
the consent of shareholders affects the property rights of shareholders. In addition, the power to decide
which liabilities to transfer out of a failing institution based upon the objectives of ensuring the

193


-----

continuity of services and avoiding adverse effects on financial stability may affect the equal treatment
of creditors.

To avoid institutions structuring their liabilities in a manner that impedes the effectiveness of the bailin tool, the BRRD requires that institutions meet at all times a MREL expressed as a percentage of the
total liabilities and own funds of the institution. When determining MREL in accordance with points
(a) and (b) of Article 45c(1) of the BRRD and in applying the bail-in tool, the resolution authority
should ensure that the institution is capable of absorbing an adequate amount of losses and that the postresolution entity is recapitalised by an amount sufficient to meet ongoing capital prudential
requirements after resolution, while sustaining sufficient market confidence. The resolution authority
should also take into account the assessments made by the competent authority on the business model,
funding model, and risk profile of the institution in order to set prudential requirements.

By delivering a comprehensive framework that ensures that shareholders and creditors bear the cost of
bank failure, the BRRD aims at:

(x) safeguarding the continuity of essential banking operations;

(xi) protecting the depositors, the client's assets and the public funds;

(xii) risks to financial stability; and

(xiii) avoiding the unnecessary destruction of value.

Accordingly, resolution powers include, among others:

- the power to reduce, including to reduce to zero, the principal amount of or outstanding amount
due in respect of eligible liabilities, of an institution under resolution;

- the power to convert eligible liabilities of an institution under resolution into ordinary shares or
other instruments of ownership of that institution;

- the power to cancel debt instruments issued by an institution under resolution except for secured
liabilities subject to Article 44(2) of the BRRD; and

- the power to reduce, including to reduce to zero, the nominal amount of shares or other
instruments of ownership of an institution under resolution and to cancel such shares or other
instruments of ownership.

These powers conferred to resolution authorities are such as to ensure that capital instruments (including
Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments) absorb losses at the point of non-viability of the issuing
institution. Accordingly, the BRRD contemplates that resolution authorities may require the write down
of such capital instruments in full or on a permanent basis, or their conversion in full into CET1
instruments, to the extent required and up to their capacity, at the point of non-viability immediately
before the application of any other resolution action, if any.

The BRRD provides, inter alia, that resolution authorities shall exercise the write down power of
reducing or converting at the point of non-viability of the issuing institution, according to an order of
priority of credits in normal insolvency procedures, in a way that results in:

(xiv) CET1 instruments being written down in proportion to the relevant losses; and

(xv) the principal amount of other capital instruments being written down and/or converted into
CET1 (Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments).

194


-----

Resolution authorities may also apply the bail-in tool to meet the resolution objectives, for any of the
following purposes:

(xvi) to recapitalise an institution that meets the conditions for resolution to the extent sufficient to
restore its ability to comply with the conditions for authorisation and to continue to carry out
the activities for which it is authorised and to sustain sufficient market confidence in the
institution or entity; or

(xvii) to convert to equity or reduce the principal amount of claims or debt instruments that are

transferred:

(a) to a bridge institution with a view to providing capital for that bridge institution; or

(b) under the sale of business tool or the asset separation tool.

When applying the bail-in tool, resolution authorities exercise the write-down and conversion powers
meeting the following sequence:

1. Common Equity Tier 1;

2. Additional Tier 1 instruments;

3. Tier 2 instruments;

4. Other subordinated debt, in accordance with the normal insolvency hierarchy; and

5. Other eligible liabilities, in accordance with the normal insolvency hierarchy.

On 3 September 2016, the European Commission adopted the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1450,
of 23 May 2016, supplementing the BRRD regulatory technical standards, which entered into force on
23 September 2016, specifying the criteria relating to the methodology for setting the minimum
requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities. This directive requires that institutions meet the
MREL to avoid excessive reliance on forms of funding that are excluded from bail-in or other resolution
measures and prevent the risk of contagion to other institutions and "bank run" situations, since failure
to meet the MREL would negatively impact the institutions' loss absorption and recapitalisation
capacity and, ultimately, the overall effectiveness of resolution.

The MREL shall be calculated based on different components, namely:

- the loss absorption amount, based on the current capital requirements, including regulatory
capital requirements (8% of RWA), the combined buffer requirements, and additional pillar 2
bank-specific requirements set by the supervisor;

- the recapitalisation amount (RCA), which aims to cover the capital requirements of the failing
institution post-resolution, taking into account potential divestments and other resolution
actions under the preferred resolution strategy, and the need to maintain sufficient market
confidence; and

- adjustments to overall MREL target, namely the DGS adjustment, linked to any potential
involvement of a DGS to protect insured depositors.

Resolution authorities may be able to require, on a case-by-case basis, the MREL to be wholly or
partially composed of own funds or of a specific type of liabilities.

195


-----

On 23 November 2016, the European Commission published proposals for certain amendments to the
BRRD (BRRD II), which include certain proposals in relation to the quality and quantity of MREL
required by European banks. BRRD II, which entered into force in 27 June 2019, will be applied after
being transposed into national law, up to December 2020. A new category of banks ("top-tier banks")
was created with the entry into force of the BRRD II, enlarging the group pf banks for which a statutory
minimum requirement is applicable. Top-tier banks are non-G-SIIs with assets above EUR 100 billion.
MREL is calculated differently for G-SIIs, "top-tier banks" and other banks subject to resolution.
Institutions not meeting the criteria for "top-tier banks" can, however, under certain conditions, be
classified as such.

The Bank is currently subject to an entity-specific MREL requirement. As further described in the
section Trends Information, the Bank has been notified by the Banco de Portugal on the Single
Resolution Board's decision regarding the MREL.

On a speech made to the European Parliament ECON Committee, Elke König referred to the adoption
by the SRB of a pragmatic common-sense approach as required by circumstances created by the Covid19 outbreak by postponing less urgent reporting and thus providing operational relief. As regards
existing MREL binding targets, the SRB is taking a forward-looking approach to banks that may face
difficulties meeting those targets before new decisions, as part of the 2020 resolution cycle.

On 27 December 2017, Directive (EU) 2017/2399 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of
12 December 2017, amending the BRRD as regards the ranking of unsecured debt instruments in
insolvency hierarchy was published in the Official Journal of the EU. The Directive entered into force
on 28 December 2017 and was transposed to Portuguese legal framework by Law No. 23/2019, of 13
March, in addition to the governing of the position of the unsecured debt instruments in the insolvency
hierarchy, providing greater legal certainty to the issuance of non-preferred debt, also confers a
preferential claim to all deposits vis-a-vis senior debt.

On 19 March 2020, the European Commission adopted a Temporary Framework to enable Member
States to further support the economy in the COVID-19 outbreak. It establishes that if due to the
COVID-19 outbreak, banks would need direct support in the form of liquidity recapitalisation or
impaired asset measure, the bank receiving such direct support would not automatically be deemed to
be failing-or-likely-to-fail, as established by the BRRD. To the extent such measures address problems
linked to the COVID-19 outbreak, they would be an exception to the requirement of burden-sharing by
shareholders and subordinated creditors.

The SRM and SRF are regulated by the SRM Regulation, which also established the framework for
recovery and resolution of credit institutions and the calculation method of the annual contributions for
the funding of the resolution mechanism.

The main decision-making body of the SRM is the SRB which is responsible for:

(xviii) the planning and resolution phases of the Banking Union's cross-border and large banks, which

are directly supervised by the ECB;

(xix) all resolution cases that require recourse to the SRF, irrespective of the size of the bank;

(xx) all banks in the Banking Union.

The SRB will work in close cooperation with, and will give instructions to, the national authorities of
Member States, including Banco de Portugal, which is the national resolution authority in Portugal.
The national authorities of participating Member States (including the Portuguese Republic) are

196


-----

responsible for planning and adopting resolution plans in respect of those banks for which the SRB is
not directly responsible.

The SRF is financed through _ex-ante contributions paid annually at individual level by all credit_
institutions within the Banking Union. Contributions to the SRF:

(xxi) take into account the annual target level of the SRF set by the SRB as well as the size and the
risk profile of institutions;

(xxii) are collected by national resolution authorities and transferred to the SRF by 30 June of every

year (in accordance with Article 67(4) of the SRM Regulation and in accordance with the
intergovernmental agreement on the transfer and mutualisation of contributions to the SRF
("Intergovernmental Agreement");

(xxiii) are calculated by the methodology as set out in the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU)

2015/63, of 21 October 2014, as amended, and the SRM Regulation; and

(xxiv) are calculated on the basis of the amount of liabilities deducted from the liability elements that

belong to Tier 1 and additional own funds and the deposits covered by the Deposit Guarantee
Scheme and subject to an adjustment in accordance with the risk profile of the participating
institution, considering its solvability situation.

In accordance to SRM Regulation, the use of the SRF shall be contingent upon the entry into force of
an agreement among the participating Member States on transferring the funds raised at national level
towards the SRF as well as on a progressive merger of the different funds raised at national level to be
allocated to national compartments of the SRF. This Regulation is applicable since 1 January 2016. As
such, the SRF does not cover ongoing situations with the Resolution Fund as at 31 December 2015.

In 2015, following the establishment of the SRF, the Group made an initial EUR 31.4 million
contribution. In accordance with the Intergovernmental Agreement, this amount was not transferred to
the SRF but was used instead to partially cover the disbursements made by the Resolution Fund for
resolution measures applied prior to the date of application of this Intergovernmental Agreement.
Consequently, an equivalent amount will have to be transferred over a period of 8 years (starting in
2016) through periodic contributions to the SRF.

_The Portuguese Resolution Fund_

This fund consists of a resolution fund whose primary purpose has been to provide financial support for
the application of resolution measures as determined by Banco de Portugal ("Resolution Fund"). The
Resolution Fund foresees the participation of:

(xxv) credit institutions with a head office in Portugal, including the Bank;

(xxvi) branches of credit institutions in states that do not belong to the EU;

(xxvii) relevant companies for the management of payment systems subject to supervision of Banco

de Portugal; and

(xxviii) certain types of investment companies.

Decree-Law No. 31-A/2012, of 10 February 2012, which amended the Banking Law, also introduced,
on terms subsequently amended by Law No. 23-A/2015, of 26 March 2015, the creation of the privileges
accorded to claims associated with loans backed-up by deposits under the Deposit Guarantee Fund (the
"DGF"), as well as credit secured by the DGF, by the Integrated Mutual Agricultural Scheme (which,

197


-----

in Portugal, is formed by the Central Mutual Agricultural Bank (Caixa Central de Crédito Agrícola
_Mútua) and its associated banks) or by the Resolution Fund, arising from the potential financial support_
that these institutions might give in the context of the implementation of resolution measures, within
the limits of the applicable laws.

The regime established in Decree-Law No. 24/2013 establishes that the Bank of Portugal fixes, by
instruction, the rate to be applied each year based on objective incidence of periodic contributions. The
instruction of the Bank of Portugal no. 24/2019, published on 16 December 2019, set the base rate to
be effective in 2020 for the determination of periodic contributions to the Resolution Fund by 0.06%
against the rate of 0.057% in 2019.

Increases in the base rate in future years may reduce the Bank's profitability. The contribution of the
Bank to the Resolution Fund was EUR 16.0 million in 2019, EUR 12.1 million in 2018, EUR 8.5 million
in 2017 and EUR 5.7 million in 2016. The ex-ante contributions for the Resolution Fund are calculated
in the same way as the abovementioned SRF contributions are calculated.

According to Article 14(5) of Law No. 23-A/2015, of 26 March 2015, and without prejudice to the ex_ante and ex-post contributions regulated by the regime, further ex-ante and ex-post contributions can be_
charged for the Resolution Fund in accordance with the regime of Decree-Law No. 24/2013, of 19
February 2013, if these contributions are intended to enable the compliance with the obligations
undertaken or to be undertaken by the Resolution Fund by virtue of having financially supported
resolution measures until 31 December 2014.

_Application of resolution measures to Novo Banco_

On 3 August 2014, with the purpose of safeguarding the stability of the financial system, Bank of
Portugal applied a resolution measure to Banco Espírito Santo, S.A. (BES) in accordance with the
Article 145-C (1.b) of the Legal Framework of Credit Institutions and Financial Companies, namely by
the partial transfer of assets, liabilities, off-balance sheet items and assets under management into a
transition bank, Novo Banco, S.A. (Novo Banco), incorporated on that date by a decision issued by the
Bank of Portugal. Within the scope of this process, the Resolution Fund made a capital contribution to
Novo Banco amounting to EUR 4,900 million, becoming, on that date, the sole shareholder.

Within this context, the Resolution Fund borrowed EUR 4,600 million, of which EUR 3,900 million
were granted by the State and EUR 700 million by a group of credit institutions, including the Bank.

As announced on 29 December 2015, Bank of Portugal transferred to the Resolution Fund the liabilities
emerging from the "eventual negative effects of future decisions regarding the resolution process that
may result in liabilities or contingencies".

On 7 July 2016, the Resolution Fund declared that it would analyse and evaluate the diligences to be
taken, following the publication of the report on the result of the independent evaluation, made to
estimate the level of credit recovery for each category of creditors under a hypothetical scenario of a
normal insolvency process of BES on 3 August 2014.

In accordance with the applicable law, when the BES liquidation process is over, if it is verified that
the creditors, whose credits were not transferred to Novo Banco, would take on a higher loss than the
one they would hypothetically take if BES had gone into liquidation right before the application of the
resolution measure, such creditors shall be entitled to receive the difference from the Resolution Fund.

On 31 May 2019, the Liquidation Committee of BES presented a list of all the acknowledged and a list
of the non-acknowledged creditors before the court and the subsequent terms of the proceedings. This
list details that the total of the acknowledge credits, including capital, remunerative and default interest

198


-----

amounts to EUR 5,056,814,588, of which EUR 2,221,549,499 are common credits and EUR
2,835,265,089 are subordinated claims, there being no guaranteed or privileged claims. Both the total
number of acknowledged creditors and the total value of the acknowledged credits and their ranking
will only be ultimately determined with the definitive judicial judgment of the verification and ranking
of credits to be given in the liquidation proceedings.

Following the resolution measure of BES, a significant number of lawsuits against the Resolution Fund
was filed and is underway. According to note 23 of the Resolution Fund's annual report of 2018, "Legal
actions related to the application of resolution measures have no legal precedents, which make it
impossible to use of case law in their evaluation, as well as a reliable estimate of the associated
contingent financial impact. However, on 12 March 2019, the Administrative Court of Lisbon
unanimously by its 20 judges delivered its judgment, confirming the constitutionality of the legal regime
of the resolution and the full legality of the resolution measure applied to BES on 3 August 2014. Also,
by decision of the Supreme Administrative Court on 13 March 2019, a judgment on the substance was
entirely favourable to the Resolution Fund associated to the impugnation of the sale process of Novo
Banco. The Board of Directors supported by lawyers opinion, which sponsored these actions, and in
the light of the legal and procedural information available so far, considers that there is no evidence to
cast doubt on their belief that the probability of success is higher than the probability of failure".

On 31 March 2017, Bank of Portugal communicated the sale of Novo Banco, where it states the
following: "Banco of Portugal today selected Lone Star to complete the sale of Novo Banco. The
Resolution Fund has consequently signed the contractual documents of the transaction. Under the terms
of the agreement, Lone Star will inject a total of EUR 1,000 million in Novo Banco, of which EUR 750
million at completion and EUR 250 million within a period of up to 3 years. Through the capital
injection, Lone Star will hold 75% of the share capital of Novo Banco and the Resolution Fund will
maintain 25% of the share capital".

The terms agreed also include a Contingent Capital Agreement, under which the Resolution Fund, as a
shareholder, undertakes to make capital injections if certain cumulative conditions are to be met related
to the performance of a specific portfolio of assets and to the capital ratios of Novo Banco going
forward.

If these conditions are met, the Resolution Fund may be called upon to make a payment to Novo Banco
for the lesser of the accumulated losses in the covered assets and the amount necessary to restore the
capital ratios at the agreed levels. Any capital injections to be carried out pursuant to this contingent
mechanism are limited to an absolute cap. The terms agreed also provide for mechanisms to safeguard
the interests of the Resolution Fund, to align incentives as well as monitoring mechanisms,
notwithstanding the limitations arising from State Aid rules.

On 18 October 2017, following the resolution of the Council of Ministers no. 151-A/2017 of 2 October
2017, the Bank of Portugal communicated the conclusion of the sale of Novo Banco to Lone Star, with
an injection by the new shareholder of EUR 750 million, followed by a further capital increase of EUR
250 million by the end of 2017. Upon completion of the transaction, the status of Novo Banco as a
bridge institution ceased, fully complying with the purposes of the resolution of Banco Espírito Santo.

On 26 February 2018, the European Commission published the non-confidential version of its decision
regarding the approval of State aid underlying Novo Banco's sale process. This statement identifies the
three support measures by the Resolution Fund and the State that are part of the sale agreement
associated with a total gross book value of around EUR 10-20 billion[25] that revealed significant
uncertainties regarding adequacy in provisioning [26]:

(xxix) Contingent Capital Agreement (CCA) which allows Lone Star to reclaim, from the Resolution

Fund, funding costs, realised losses and provisions related to an _ex-ante agreed portfolio of_
existing loan stock, up to a maximum of EUR 3.89 billion, subject to a capital ratio trigger
(CET1 below 8%-13%) as well as to some additional conditions [8 9 27];

(xxx) underwriting by the Resolution Fund of a Tier 2 instrument to be issued by Novo Banco up to
the amount necessary (but no more than EUR 400 million). The amount that can be reclaimed
by the Resolution Fund under the Contingent Capital Agreement is subject to the cap of EUR
3.89 billion[28];

(xxxi) in case the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process ("SREP") total capital ratio of Novo

Banco falls below the SREP total capital requirement, the State will provide additional capital
in certain conditions and through different instruments[29].

According to the 2018 Resolution Fund's annual report, the Resolution Fund and Novo Banco have
agreed that a Verification Agent - an independent entity which is essentially responsible for settling any
differences that may exist between Novo Banco and the Resolution Fund regarding the set of
calculations inherent to the Contingent Capital Agreement or regarding the practical application of the
principles stipulated in the contract - is in charge of confirming that the perimeter of the mechanism is
correct and that the balance sheet values of Novo Banco are being correctly reflected in the mechanism,
as well as verifying the underlying set of calculations, namely by confirming the correct calculation of
losses and the reference value of the assets.

Also in its 2018 annual report, the Resolution Fund states that "Regarding future periods, a significant
uncertainty as to the relevant parameters for the calculation of future liabilities is deemed to exist, either
for their increase or reduction, under the terms of the agreement on the Contingent Capital Agreement
with Novo Banco".

The Resolution Fund disclosed on 17 June 2019 a set of clarifications related to the payment due in
2019 under the CCA with Novo Banco, namely:

– For payments from the Resolution Fund to be made (limited to a maximum of EUR 3,890
million over the lifetime of the mechanism), losses on the assets under the contingent
mechanism should be incurred and the capital ratios of Novo Banco should stand below the
agreed reference thresholds;

– The payment to be made by the Resolution Fund corresponds to the lower of the accumulated
losses on the assets covered and the amount necessary to restore the capital ratios above the
minimum reference threshold;

– The reference capital ratios are, in 2017, 2018 and 2019, linked to the regulatory requirements
applicable to Novo Banco (CET1 ratio of 11.25% and Tier 1 ratio of 12.75%), but, as from
2020, the reference ratio will correspond to a CET1 ratio of 12%;

– The initial reference value of the portfolio comprising the Contingent Capitalisation Agreement
was as of 30 June 2016 of EUR 7,838 million (book value of the associated assets, net of
impairments), and the value of the portfolio, as of 31 December 2018, amounted to
approximately EUR 3,920 million (book value, net of impairments);

27 According to 2018 Novo Banco's earnings institutional presentation, the "minimum capital condition" is (i) CET1 or Tier 1 <
CET1 or Tier 1 SREP requirement plus a buffer for the first three years (2017-2019); (ii) CET1 < 12%

28 As referred to in the respective European Commission Decision

-----

– The accumulated losses of the covered assets and their management, between 30 June 2016
(reference date of the mechanism) and 31 December 2018, correspond to EUR 2,661 million.
Of this amount, the Resolution Fund paid in 2018, in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the CCA, around EUR 792 million, hence, the amount of losses not borne by the Fund was,
at the end of 2018, approximately EUR 1,869 million;

– The amount necessary to maintain the capital ratios of Novo Banco for 2018 at the agreed levels
is EUR 1,149 million. The amount payable by the Resolution Fund results from a comparison
between the amount of EUR 1.869 million (accumulated loss on the covered assets not
supported by the Fund) and the amount of EUR 1,149 million, corresponding to the lower of
those amounts, i.e. EUR 1,149 million.

On 24 May 2018, arising from the referred mechanism, the Resolution Fund paid EUR 792 million to
Novo Banco using its available financial resources from banking contributions (direct or indirect) and
complemented by a State loan of EUR 430 million under the terms agreed between the Portuguese State
and the Resolution Fund in October 2017. In its 2018 annual results press release, on 1 March 2019,
Novo Banco states that, in connection with the impact of losses related to the sale and write-downs of
legacy assets, Novo Banco will request a compensation of EUR 1,149 million under the existing CCA.
The Resolution Fund paid to Novo Banco on 6 May 2019 the calculated value relative to the 2018
exercise, in the amount of EUR 1.149 million. For this purpose, the Resolution Fund used its own
resources and also resorted to a State loan of EUR 850 million, which corresponds to the annual
maximum funding limit agreed between the Resolution Fund and the State. The amount paid by the
Resolution Fund to Novo Banco in two years was EUR 1,941 million.

According to Novo Banco's 2019 earnings press release, Novo Banco will request a compensation of
EUR 1.037 million under the Contingent Capital Agreement (CCA), as stipulated in the sale agreement.
The amount of the compensation requested in 2017 and 2018 and to be requested relating to 2019 totals
EUR 2.98 billion. The maximum amount of compensation established in the CCA is EUR 3.89 billion.

As at 31 December 2019, Novo Banco is held by Lone Star and the Resolution Fund, corresponding to
75% and 25% of the share capital respectively.

_Resolution measure of Banif – Banco Internacional do Funchal, S.A._

On 19 December 2015, the Board of Directors of Bank of Portugal announced that Banif was "at risk
of insolvency or insolvent" and started an urgent resolution process of the institution through the partial
or total sale of its activity, which was completed on 20 December 2015 through the sale to Banco
Santander Totta S.A. (BST) of the rights and obligations of Banif, formed by the assets, liabilities, offbalance sheet items and assets under management.

The largest portion of the assets that were not sold, were transferred to an asset management vehicle
denominated Oitante, S.A. (Oitante) specifically created for that purpose, having the Resolution Fund
as the sole shareholder. For that matter, Oitante issued bonds representing debt in the amount of EUR
746 million. The Resolution Fund provided a guarantee and the Portuguese State a counter-guarantee.
The operation also involved state aid, of which EUR 489 million were provided by the Resolution Fund,
which was funded by a mutual contract given by the State.

According to the Resolution Fund's 2018 annual report, "to ensure that the Fund has, at due date, the
financial resources necessary to comply with this guarantee, if the principal debtor – Oitante - defaults,
the Portuguese State counter-guarantees the referred bond issue. Until 31 December 2018, Oitante
made partial prepayments of EUR 360.961 million, which reduces the amount of the guarantee provided
by the Resolution Fund to EUR 385.038 million. Considering the anticipated reimbursements, as well
as information provided by Oitante's Board of Directors regarding 2018 exercise, it is envisaged that

201


-----

there are no relevant situations that could trigger the guarantee provided by the Resolution Fund". On
13 July 2019, Oitante states that "at the end of the current month, July 2019, the debt reimbursed since
it was incurred will reach 57.7%".

Also, according to this source, "The outstanding debt related to the amount made available by the State
to finance the absorption of BANIF's losses, following the resolution measure applied by Banco de
Portugal to that entity amounts to EUR 352,880.3 thousand". This partial early repayment of EUR 136
million corresponds to the revenue of the contribution collected, until 31 December 2015, from the
institutions covered by the SRM Regulation which was not transferred to the Single Resolution Fund
and which will be paid to the Single Resolution Fund by the credit institutions that are covered by this
scheme over a period of 8 years starting in 2016 (according to the Resolution Fund's 2016 annual
report).

_Liabilities and Financing of the Resolution Fund_

Pursuant to the resolution measures applied to BES and Banif the Resolution Fund borrowed loans and
assumed other responsibilities and contingent liabilities resulting from:

– The State loans, on 31 December 2018 included the amounts made available (i) in 2014 for the
financing of the resolution measure applied to BES (EUR 3,900 million); (ii) to finance the
absorption of Banif's losses (EUR 353 million); (iii) under the framework agreement concluded
with the State in October 2017 for the financing of the measures under the Contingent Capital
Agreement (EUR 430 million plus EUR 850 million of additional funding requested in 2019,
as described above);

– Other funding granted by the institutions participating in the Resolution Fund in the amount of
EUR 700 million, in which the Bank participates, within the scope of BES resolution measure;

– Underwriting by the Resolution Fund of a Tier 2 instrument to be issued by Novo Banco up to
the amount of EUR 400 million. This underwriting did not take place as the instruments were
placed with third party investors as disclosed by Novo Banco on 29 July 2018;

– Effects of the application of the principle that no creditor of the credit institution under
resolution may assume a loss greater than the one it would take if that institution did not go into
liquidation;

– Negative effects resulting from the resolution process that result in additional liabilities or
contingencies for Novo Banco, S.A., which must be neutralized by the Resolution Fund;

– Legal proceedings filed against the Resolution Fund;

– Guarantee granted to the bonds issued by Oitante S.A. This guarantee is counter-guaranteed
by the Portuguese State;

– Contingent Capital Agreement which allows Lone Star to reclaim, from the Resolution Fund,
funding costs, realised losses and provisions related to the aforementioned ex-ante portfolio of
existing loan stock agreed upon the sale process to Lone Star up to EUR 3,89 billion under the
aforementioned conditions, among which a reduction of CET1 below 8%-13%;

– In case the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) total capital ratio of Novo
Banco falls below the SREP total capital requirement, the State will provide additional capital
in certain conditions and through different instruments as referred to in the respective European
Commission Decision.

According to note 24 of the Resolution Fund's 2018 annual report, the Resolution Fund considers that,
to date, there are no elements that allow a reliable estimate of the potential financial effect of these
potential liabilities.

By a public statement on 28 September 2016, the Resolution Fund and the Ministry of Finance
communicated the agreement based on a review of the terms of the EUR 3,900 million loan originally
granted by the State to the Resolution Fund in 2014 to finance the resolution measure applied to BES.
According to the Resolution Fund, the extension of the maturity of the loan was intended to ensure the
ability of the Resolution Fund to meet its obligations through its regular revenues, regardless of the
contingencies to which the Resolution Fund is exposed. On the same day, the Office of the Minister of
Finance also announced that increases in the liabilities arising from the materialisation of future
contingencies will determine the maturity adjustment of State and Bank loans to the Resolution Fund,
in order to maintain the contributory effort required to the banking sector at current levels.

According to the communication of the Resolution Fund of 21 March 2017:

– "The conditions of the loans obtained from the Fund to finance the resolution measures applied
to Banco Espírito Santo, S.A. and to Banif– Banco Internacional do Funchal, S.A. were
changed. These loans amount to EUR 4,953 million, of which EUR 4,253 million were granted
by the Portuguese State and EUR 700 million were granted by a group of banks";

– "Those loans are now due in December 2046, without prejudice to the possibility of being
repaid early based on the use of the Resolution Fund's revenues. The due date will be adjusted
so that it enables the Resolution Fund to fully meet its liabilities based on regular revenues and
without the need for special contributions or any other type of extraordinary contributions. The
liabilities resulting from the loans agreed between the Resolution Fund and the Sate and the
banks pursuant to the resolution measures applied to BES and Banif are handled with one
another";

– "The revision of the loans' conditions aimed to ensure the sustainability and financial balance
of the Resolution Fund";

– "The new conditions enable the full payment of the liabilities of the Resolution Fund, as well
as the respective remuneration, without the need to ask the banking sector for special
contributions or any other type of extraordinary contributions".

On 2 October 2017, by Council of Ministers (Resolution no. 151-A/2017), the Portuguese State, as the
ultimate guarantor of financial stability, was authorised to enter into a framework agreement with the
Resolution Fund, to make available the necessary financial resources to the Resolution Fund, if and
when it deemed necessary, to satisfy any contractual obligations that may arise from the sale of the 75%
stake in Novo Banco. It is also mentioned that the reimbursement will consider the stability of the
banking sector, i.e. without the Resolution Funds' participants being charged special contributions or
any other extraordinary contributions.

The Resolution Fund's own resources had a negative equity of EUR 6,114 million, according to the
latest 2018 annual report of the Resolution Fund.

To reimburse the loans obtained and to meet other liabilities that it may take on, the Resolution Fund
receives proceeds from the initial and regular contributions from the participating institutions (including
the Bank) and from the contribution over the banking sector (Law no. 55-A/2010). It is also provided
for the possibility of the member of the Government responsible for the area of Finance to determine,
by ordinance that the participating institutions make special contributions, in the situations provided for

203


-----

in the applicable legislation, particularly if the Resolution Fund does not have resources to fulfil with
their obligations.

Pursuant to Decree-Law No. 24/2013, of 19 February 2013, which establishes the method for
determining the initial, periodic and special contributions to the Resolution Fund, provided for in the
Legal Framework of Credit Institutions and Financial Companies, the Bank has been proceeding, since
2013, to the mandatory contributions, as provided for in the Decree-Law.

On 3 November 2015, the Bank of Portugal issued a Circular Letter under which it is clarified that the
periodic contribution to the Resolution Fund should be recognised as an expense at the time of the
occurrence of the event which creates the obligation to pay the contribution, i.e. on the last day of April
of each year, as stipulated in Article 9 of the referred Decree-Law, thus the Bank is recognising as an
expense the contribution to the RF in the year in which it becomes due.

The Resolution Fund issued, on 15 November 2015, a public statement declaring: "...it is further
clarified that it is not expected that the Resolution Fund will propose the setting up of a special
contribution to finance the resolution measure applied to Banco Espírito Santo, S.A., ('BES').
Therefore, the eventual collection of a special contribution appears to be unlikely".

The regime established in Decree-Law No. 24/2013 establishes that the Bank of Portugal fixes, by
instruction, the rate to be applied each year based on objective incidence of periodic contributions. The
instruction of the Bank of Portugal no. 24/2019, published on 16 December 2019, set the base rate to
be effective in 2020 for the determination of periodic contributions to the FR by 0.06% against the rate
of 0.057% in 2019.

During 2019, the Group made regular contributions to the Resolution Fund in the amount of
EUR 15.965 million. The amount related to the contribution on the banking sector, registered in 2019,
was EUR 31.818 million. These contributions were recognized as a cost in 2019, in accordance with
IFRIC no. 21 – Levies.

In 2015, following the establishment of the SRF, the Group had to make an initial contribution in the
amount of EUR31.364 million. In accordance with the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Transfer
and Mutualisation of Contributions to the SRF, this amount was not transferred to the SRF but was used
instead to partially cover for the disbursements made by the RF in respect of resolution measures prior
to the date of application of this Agreement. This amount will have to be reinstated over a period of 8
years (started in 2016) through the periodic contributions to the SRF. The total amount of the
contribution attributable to the Group in 2019 was EUR 21.918 million, of which the Group delivered
EUR 18.747 million and the remaining was constituted as irrevocable payment commitment. The SRF
does not cover undergoing situations with the Resolution Fund as at 31 December 2015.

It is not possible, on this date, to assess the effects on the Resolution Fund due to: (i) the sale of the
shareholding in Novo Banco in accordance with the communication of Banco de Portugal dated 18
October 2017 and the information provided by the European Commission on this subject under the
terms described above, including the effects of the application of the Contingent Capital Agreeement;
(ii) the application of the principle that no creditor of the credit institution under resolution may take on
a loss greater than the one it would take if that institution did not go into liquidation; (iii) additional
liabilities or contingencies for Novo Banco, S.A. which need to be neutralized by the Resolution Fund;
(iv) legal proceedings against the Resolution Fund, including "processo dos lesados do BES"; and (v)
the guarantee provided to the bonds issued by Oitante, in this case, the referred trigger is not expectable
in accordance to the most recent information communicated by the Resolution Fund in its annual
accounts.

204


-----

According to Article 5 (e) of the Regulation of the Resolution Fund, approved by the Ministerial Order
no. 420/2012, of 21 December, the Resolution Fund may submit to the Government a proposal for the
implementation of special contributions to rebalance the financial condition of the Resolution Fund.
According to public communications from both the Resolution Fund and from the Government, there
is no indication that any such special contributions are foreseen.

According to the Resolution Fund's 2018 annual report, under note 10, "the Resolution Fund is not
obliged to present positive equity. In case of insufficient resources, the Resolution Fund may receive
special contributions, as determined by the member of the Government responsible for finance, in
accordance with article 153-I of the Legal Framework of Credit Institutions and Financial Companies
and no such contributions are foreseen, in particular after a review of the financing conditions of the
Resolution Fund".

Eventual alterations regarding this matter may have relevant implications in future financial statements
of the Group.

The COVID-19 pandemic and heightened uncertainty about the magnitude and duration of the outbreak
create an additional context of uncertainty with respect to its impacts.

_The European Deposit Guarantee System_

On 16 April 2014, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 2014/49/EU on DGS
("DGS Directive"). The Directive encompasses the harmonisation of the funding mechanisms of DGS,
the introduction of risk-based contributions and the harmonisation of the scope of products and
depositors covered. In accordance with the DGS Directive, each credit institution should be part of a
DGS recognised under this Directive, thereby ensuring a high level of consumer protection and a level
playing field between credit institutions, while also preventing regulatory arbitrage. The DGS Directive
sets the harmonised coverage level at EUR 100,000 and retains the principle of a harmonised limit per
depositor rather than per deposit (such limit to be applied, in principle, to each identifiable depositor,
except for collective investment undertakings subject to special protection rules). Each institution's
contribution to DGS will be based on the amount of covered deposits and the degree of risk incurred by
the respective member. The DGS Directive was transposed into the Portuguese law by Law No. 23A/2015, of 26 March.

According to the BRRD, and consequently the Banking Law, with the amendments of Law No. 23A/2015, of 26 March 2015, banks must ensure that by 3 July 2024 the financial resources available to
a DGS amount to a target-level of 0.8% of the amount of DGF-covered deposits.

If, after this target level is reached for the first time, the available financial resources are reduced to less
than two thirds of the target level, the ex-ante contributions are set by Banco de Portugal at a level that
allows the target level to be reached within six years. If the available financial resources are not
sufficient to reimburse the depositors, in the event of unavailability of deposits, DGS members must
pay ex-post contributions not exceeding 0.5% of the DGF-covered deposits for the exercise period of
the DGF. In exceptional circumstances, the DGS can request a higher amount of contribution with the
approval of Banco de Portugal.

The exemption from the immediate payment of ex-ante contributions shall not exceed 30% of the total
amount of contributions raised. This possibility depends on the credit institutions undertaking
irrevocable payment commitments, to pay part of or the whole amount of the contribution which has
not been paid in cash to the DGF, that are fully backed by collateral composed of low-risk assets
unencumbered by any third-party rights and partly or wholly pledged in favour of the DGF at DGF's
request.

205


-----

The additional indirect costs of the deposit guarantee systems may be significant and can consist of
costs associated with the provision of detailed information to clients about products, costs of compliance
with specific regulations on advertising for deposits or other products similar to deposits.

**_Other financial service laws and regulations_**

The Bank is still subject to other Directives and Regulations, among which:

– Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 15 May 2014, as
amended, transposed into the national legal framework by Law No. 35/2018, of 20 July 2018,
and already in force with some additional related regulations pending, and Regulation (EU) No.
600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 15 May 2014, as amended, relating
to markets in financial instruments, known as the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II
("MiFID II") and Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation ("MiFIR"), respectively.

– Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 26
November 2014, as amended, relating to packaged retail and insurance-based investment
products, complemented by Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 653/2017 of the Commission, of 8
March 2017 ("PRIIPs"), as amended, which applies from 1 January 2018. On 4 January 2018,
the CMVM issued a "Circular" regarding PRIIPs subject to the CMVM's supervision, outlining
further applicable requirements and Law 35/2018, of 20 July 2018 introduced the legal
framework for PRIIPs in Portugal.

– The European Market Infrastructure Regulation, Regulation (EU) No. 648/2012 of the
European Parliament and of the Council, of 4 July 2012 ("EMIR"), as amended, that sets out
procedures regarding OTC markets and derivatives, namely on clearing;

– Rules and regulations related to the prevention of money laundering, bribery and terrorism
financing - Banco de Portugal is responsible for the preventive supervision of money laundering
and terrorist financing ("ML/TF") in the financial sector. Within the applicable legal
framework, the following are paramount: (i) Law No. 83/2017, of 18 August 2017, as amended,
which sets forth preventive and repressive measures to combat ML/TF; (ii) Regulation (EU)
2015/847 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015, as amended, on the
information on payers and payees, accompanying transfers of funds, in any currency, for the
purposes of preventing, detecting and investigating ML/TF; (iii) Law No. 97/2017, of 23
August 2017, which governs the application and execution of the restrictive measures approved
by the United Nations or by the European Union and sets forth the sanctions applicable to
breaches of such measures and (iv) the regulatory notice ("Aviso") of Banco de Portugal No.
2/2018, of 26 September 2018, which governs enforcement conditions, procedures,
instruments, mechanisms, enforcement measures, reporting obligations and other aspects
necessary for ensuring compliance with obligations for the prevention of ML/TF.

_Prevention, mitigation and monitoring of asset quality_

In 2013, the EBA issued a recommendation to Competent Authorities ("CAs") to perform asset quality
reviews for banks, based on newly harmonised definitions of NPLs (complemented by EBA Report on
the dynamics and drivers of non‐performing exposures in the European Union banking sector dated 22
July 2016). In 2014, CAs carried out comprehensive assessment and a stress test. EBA's Implementing
Technical Standards ("ITS") on forbearance and NPEs, issued under Commission Implementing
Regulation (EU) 2015/227, of 9 January 2015, aim at implementing uniform definitions and reporting
requirements for forbearance and NPEs. The ECB has issued in March 2017 Guidance on SSM bank's
on NPLs supplemented a year later by an addendum specifying ECB's expectations for prudent levels
of provisions for new NPLs.

206


-----

In July 2017, the European Council concluded an Action Plan to achieve a sustainable reduction of
NPEs in credit institutions' balance sheets. On 31 October 2018, the EBA published the final guidance
on management of non-performing and forborne exposures. These guidelines specify sound risk
management practices for credit institutions in their management of NPEs and forborne exposures,
including requirements on NPE reduction strategies, governance and operations of NPE workout
framework, internal control framework and monitoring.

The regulation amending the CRR to introduce common minimum coverage levels for potential losses
stemming from newly originated loans that become nonperforming has been published in Official
Journal on 17 April 2019 (Regulation (EU) 2019/630 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
17 April 2019 amending Regulation (EU) no 575/2013). This regulation establishes a requirement for
credit institutions to build their loan loss reserve up to common minimum levels to cover the incurred
and expected losses on newly originated loans that become non-performing. Where the minimum
coverage requirement is not met, the difference between the actual coverage level and the requirement
should be deducted from a bank's own funds (CET1). The new rules should not be applied in relation
to exposures originated prior to 26 April 2019. A proposal for a directive on credit servicers, credit
purchasers and recovery of collateral was also included in the comprehensive package of measures to
be tackled by the European Commission. The proposal strengthens the ability of secured creditors to
recover value from secured loans to corporates and entrepreneurs. The review by the Parliament and
Council's Working Party is ongoing.

All in all, the legal and regulatory framework regarding NPLs and NPEs creates an assortment of
obligations for credit institutions and sets forth protection measures for bank customers, including,
procedures for gathering information, contacting customers, monitoring the execution of loan
agreements and managing default risk situations; the duty to assess the financial capacity of bank
customers and present default correction proposals adapted to the debtor's situation; and drawing up a
plan for restructuring debts emerging from home loans or replacing mortgage foreclosures that in some
cases of extra-judicial procedures may restrict the Bank's options to (i) terminate the relevant
agreements; (ii) initiate judicial proceedings against the debtor; (iii) assign its credits over the client; or
(iv) transfer its contractual position to a third party.

Furthermore, as the macroprudential authority for Portugal, Banco de Portugal has approved a
recommendation introducing limits to some of the criteria used in the assessment of customers'
creditworthiness, covering the granting of new credit relating to residential immovable property, credit
secured by a mortgage or equivalent guarantee, and consumer credit agreements, to be applied to
agreements concluded as of 1 July 2018. Measures of similar nature are also in place in Poland. In
September 2017, the regulatory notice ("Aviso") No. 4/2017 of Banco de Portugal, which entered into
force on 1 January 2018, established procedures and criteria for banks for assessing customer's financial
capacity before granting mortgage loans.

On 31 January 2020, Banco de Portugal announced the amendment to the macroprudential
recommendation on new credit agreements for consumers: (i) the maximum maturity of new personal
credit operations decreases from 10 to 7 years, with some exceptions (ii) up to 10% of the total amount
of new credit granted by each institution may have a DSTI (debt service-to-income) of up to 60%,
continuing to allow institutions to consider other important aspects for assessing the borrowers'
creditworthiness that are risk mitigating factors. The 5% exception to the DSTI ratio limits will be
maintained.

Following the COVID-19 pandemic, Banco de Portugal has relaxed some of the macroprudential
measures for consumer credit. Banco de Portugal has decided that personal credit with maturities of up
to two years and duly identified as intended to mitigate households' temporary liquidity shortage
situations will no longer have to comply with a DSTI ratio limit and is also exempted from observing
the recommendation of regular principal and interest payments. This measure applies to new personal

207


-----

credit granted from 1 April 2020 until September 2020, date on which Banco de Portugal will reassess
the adequacy of this change.

_Relief measures regarding asset quality deterioration and non-performing loans_

Under the Decree-Law No. 10-J/2020, of 26 March 2020, the Portuguese government approved a sixmonth moratorium on bank loan repayments for households and companies affected by the COVID-19
outbreak. The Portuguese Government also launched state-guaranteed credit lines for medium, small
and micro enterprises in affected sectors which will be operated through the banking system.

In this context, the ECB decided to temporarily exercise flexibility in the classification requirements
and expectations on loss provisioning for NPL that are covered by public guarantees and COVID-19
related public moratoria.

In particular, and on a temporary basis, supervisors will exercise flexibility regarding: (i) the
classification of debtors as “unlikely to pay” when banks call on public guarantees granted in the context
of coronavirus and (ii) loans under COVID-19 related public moratoria. Furthermore, loans which
become non-performing and are under public guarantees will benefit from preferential prudential
treatment in terms of supervisory expectations about loss provisioning. Lastly, when discussing with
banks the implementation of NPL reduction strategies, the extraordinary nature of current market
conditions will be taken into account.

In addition, excessive volatility of loan loss provisioning should be addressed to avoid excessive
procyclicality of regulatory capital and published financial statements. Within its prudential remit, the
ECB recommends that all banks avoid procyclical assumptions in their models to determine provisions
and for banks to opt for the IFRS 9 transitional rules.

On 2 April 2020, the EBA issued guidelines (EBA/GL/2020/02) on public and private payment
moratoria on loan repayments applied before 30 June 2020, aiming to clarify the following points in the
context of the COVID-19 pandemic: (i) the criteria that payment moratoria have to fulfil not to trigger
forbearance classification, (ii) the application of the prudential requirements in the context of these
moratoria and (iii) ensuring the consistent treatment of such measures in the calculation of own funds
requirements.

In this context, these guidelines clarify that payment moratoria do not trigger classification as
forbearance or distressed restructuring if the measures taken are based on the applicable national law or
on an industry or sector-wide private initiative agreed and applied broadly by the relevant credit
institutions. In addition, the Guidelines recall that institutions must continue to adequately identify
those situations where borrowers may face longer-term financial difficulties and classify exposures in
accordance with the existing regulation. The requirements for identification of forborne exposures and
defaulted obligors remain in place.

_Insurance business_

Directive (EU) 2016/97, as amended (the "Insurance Distribution Directive") regulates the way
insurance products are designed and sold both by insurance intermediaries and directly by insurance
undertakings, namely in the cases of insurance products that have an investment element such as unitlinked life insurance contracts. The Insurance Distribution Directive was transposed into national law
by Law No. 7/2019, of 16 January, and has entered into force in October 2018. Similar in nature
provisions are also embedded in the PRIIPs Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 26 November 2014, as amended) and implementing national
provisions which entered into force in 2018. At a different level, the Solvency II in force (as amended)
and IFRS 17 to be applied from 2020 onwards, introduce additional requirements for insurance

companies in terms of minimum capital requirements, supervisory review of firms' assessment of risk
and enhanced disclosure requirements. All these may affect the insurance business and associated
earnings. Further regulatory developments are expected in the forthcoming years, such as the review
of capital requirements, long term guarantees and macroprudential tools.

**EVOLUTION OF THE SOLVENCY RATIO IN 2019**

According to BCP's interpretation of CRD IV and CRR to date, the CET1 estimated ratio as at 31
December 2019 stood at 12.2% both phased-in and fully implemented, consistent with the amounts
presented at the same period of 2018 (12.1% phased-in and 12.0% fully implemented) and above the
minimum required ratios under the SREP (Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process) for 2019
(CET1 9.625%, T1 11.125% and Total 13.125%).

The CET1 phased-in ratio performance during 2019 mainly reflects:

- the phased-in progression along with the application of the 2019 SREP result, determined an
increase of EUR 47 million in CET1 and EUR 53 million in risk weighted assets (+10 basis
points in CET1 phased-in ratio);

- the IFRS16 adoption originated EUR 256 million of increase in risk weighted assets (-7 basis
points in CET1 phase-in ratio);

- the acquisition of Eurobank by Bank Millennium in Poland, that took place in May 2019,
determined an increase of EUR 32 million in CET1 and of EUR 2,067 million in risk weighted
assets (-49 basis points in CET1 phase-in ratio);

- the pension fund's responsibilities discount rate reduction, as a consequence of the interest rate
decrease, although partially compensated by the fund's appreciation, led to a decrease of
EUR 389 million in the CET1 and EUR 148 million in the risk weighted assets (-89 basis points
in CET1 phase-in ratio).

- The T1 and Total ratio were also influenced, in 2019, by the following impacts:

- the issuance of perpetual subordinated notes qualified as Additional Tier 1, in January, in the
amount of EUR 400 million (+96 basis points in both T1 and Total ratios phased-in);

- the issuance, also in January, by Bank Millennium in Poland of subordinated bonds qualified
as Tier 2 capital instruments, amounting PLN 830 million (+10 basis points in Total ratio
phased-in).

The organic generation of capital, including the positive net income of 2019, contributed significantly
to the positive capital ratios performance in this period.

**Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic**

On 12 March 2020, the ECB announced to the banks a set of measures to be adopted in order to
guarantee the continue financing of households and corporations experiencing temporary difficulties,
due to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are felt worldwide.

The supervisory measures aim to support banks in serving the economy and addressing operational
challenges, including the pressure on their staff.

The capital buffers have been designed with a view to allowing banks to withstand stressed situations
and since the European banking sector has built up a significant amount of these buffers, the ECB will
allow banks to operate temporarily below the capital level defined by P2G and the capital conservation
buffer.

Banks will also be allowed to partially use capital instruments that do not qualify as CET1 capital, for
example Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 instruments, to meet the P2R. This brings forward a measure that
was initially scheduled to come into effect in January 2021, as part of the latest revision of the CRD V.

Despite the above measures providing significant capital relief, the Bank does not currently have
objective data to estimate the impacts of this crisis on its activity and capital levels.

**TAXATION**

_The following is a general description of certain tax considerations relating to the Notes. It does not_
_purport to be a complete analysis of all tax considerations relating to the Notes, whether in those_
_countries or elsewhere. The tax laws of an investor's Member State and of the Issuer’s Member State of_
_incorporation might have an impact on the income received from the securities. Prospective purchasers_
_of Notes should consult their own tax advisers as to which countries' tax laws could be relevant to_
_acquiring, holding and disposing of Notes and receiving payments of interest, principal and/or other_
_amounts under the Notes and the consequences of such actions under the tax laws of those countries. It_
_should also be noted that there are differences in the tax treatment of different Notes. This summary is_
_based upon the law as in effect on the date of this Offering Circular and is subject to any change in law_
_that may take effect after such date._

**1.** **Portuguese Taxation**

**The following is a general summary of the Bank's understanding of current law and practice in**
**Portugal as in effect on the date of this Offering Circular in relation to certain current relevant**
**aspects to Portuguese taxation of the Notes and is subject to changes in such laws, including**
**changes that could have a retroactive effect. Potentially applicable transitional rules have not**
**been considered. The following summary is intended as a general guide only and is not exhaustive.**
**It is not intended to be, nor should it be considered to be, legal or tax advice to any holder of**
**Notes. It neither takes into account nor discusses investors' individual circumstances or the tax**
**laws of any country other than Portugal, and it relates only to the position of persons who are**
**absolute beneficial owners of the Notes. Prospective investors are advised to consult their own tax**
**advisers as to the Portuguese or other tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposal**
**of Notes. Tax consequences may differ according to the provisions of different double taxation**
**treaties, as well as according to a prospective investor's particular circumstances.**

The reference to "interest", "other investment income" and "capital gains" in the paragraphs below
means "interest", "other investment income" and "capital gains" as understood in Portuguese tax law.
The statements below do not take into account different definitions of "interest", "other investment
income" or "capital gains" which may prevail under any other law or which may be created by the
"Terms and Conditions of the Note" or any related documentation.

Economic benefits derived from interest, accrued interest, amortisation or reimbursement premiums
and other instances of remuneration arising from the Notes are designated as investment income for
Portuguese tax purposes.

Gains obtained with the repayment of Notes or of any other debt securities are qualified as capital gains
for Portuguese tax purposes.

_Portuguese resident holders and non-resident holders with a Portuguese permanent establishment_

Interest and other types of investment income obtained on Notes by a Portuguese resident individual is
subject to withholding tax at 28%, which, if such income is not earned as business or professional
income, is the final tax on that income unless the individual elects to include it in his/ her taxable income
subject to tax at progressive rates of up to 48%. In the latter case, an additional income tax rate will be
due on the part of the taxable income exceeding EUR 80,000 as follows: (i) 2.5% on the part of the
taxable income up to EUR 250,000 and (ii) 5% on the remaining part (if any) of the taxable income
exceeding EUR 250,000.

Gains obtained on the disposal or the refund of the Notes by an individual resident in Portugal for tax
purposes are subject to Portuguese capital gains taxation on the (annual) positive difference between

228


-----

such gains and gains on other securities and losses in securities. Tax applies at 28%, which is the final
tax on that income, unless the individual elects to include it in his/her taxable income, subject to tax at
progressive rates of up to 48%. In the latter case, an additional income tax rate will be due on the part
of the taxable income exceeding EUR 80,000 as follows: (i) 2.5% on the part of the taxable income up
to EUR 250,000 and (ii) 5% on the remaining part (if any) of the taxable income exceeding EUR
250,000.

Stamp tax at 10% applies to the acquisition through gift or inheritance of Notes by an individual who
is domiciled in Portugal. An exemption applies to transfers in favour of the spouse (or person living
together as spouse), descendants and parents/grandparents.

Interest or other investment income derived from the Notes and capital gains realised with the transfer
of the Notes by legal persons resident for tax purposes in Portugal and by non-resident legal persons
with a permanent establishment in Portugal to which the income or gains are attributable are included
in their taxable profits and are subject to Portuguese corporate tax at 21% or 17% on the first EUR
25,000 in the case of small and medium-sized enterprises and may be subject to a municipal surcharge
("derrama municipal") of up to 1.5%. A state surcharge ("derrama estadual") also applies at 3% on
taxable profits in excess of EUR 1,500,000 and up to EUR 7,500,000, and at 5% on taxable profits in
excess of EUR 7,500,000 up to EUR 35,000,000, and at 9% on taxable profits in excess of
EUR 35,000,000.

Withholding tax at 25% applies to interest and other investment income, which is deemed a payment
on account of the final tax due. The withholding (and final) tax rate is 21% in the case of entities
benefiting from a tax exemption under Articles 9 and 10 of the corporate tax code that does not apply
to investment income.

Financial institutions, pension funds, retirement and/or education savings funds, venture capital funds,
collective investment undertakings and some exempt entities, among other entities, are not subject to
withholding tax.

Interest and other investment income paid or made available ("colocado à disposição") to accounts in
the name of one or more accountholders acting on behalf of undisclosed entities is subject to a final
withholding tax at 35%, unless the beneficial owner of the income is disclosed, in which case the general
rules will apply.

The acquisition of Notes through gift or inheritance by a Portuguese resident legal person or a
non-resident acting through a Portuguese permanent establishment is subject to Portuguese corporate
tax at 21%, or 17% on the first EUR 25,000 in the case of small and medium-sized enterprises. A
municipal surcharge ("derrama municipal") of up to 1.5% may also be due. A state surcharge ("derrama
_estadual") also applies at 3% on taxable profits in excess of EUR 1,500,000 and up to EUR 7,500,000,_
and at 5% on taxable profits in excess of EUR 7,500,000 up to EUR 35,000,000, and at 9% on taxable
profits in excess of EUR 35,000,000.

There is no wealth nor estate tax in Portugal.

_Non-resident holders without a Portuguese permanent establishment – General rules_

Interest and other types of investment income obtained by non-resident holders without a Portuguese
permanent establishment to which the income is attributable is subject to withholding tax at 28%
(individuals) or 25% (legal persons), which is the final tax on that income. The withholding tax rate is
35% in the case of individuals or legal persons domiciled in a country, territory or region included in
the "tax havens" list approved by Ministerial Order No. 150/2004, of 13 February 2004, as amended
from time to time (hereafter "Ministerial Order No. 150/2004").

229


-----

Interest and other investment income paid or made available ("colocado à disposição") to accounts in
the name of one or more accountholders acting on behalf of undisclosed entities is subject to a final
withholding tax at 35%, unless the beneficial owner of the income is disclosed, in which case the general
rules will apply.

Under the tax treaties entered into by Portugal, the withholding tax rate may be reduced to 15, 12, 10
or 5%, depending on the applicable treaty and provided that the relevant formalities are met. These
formalities include the certification, through a document issued by the competent tax authorities, of the
residence of the beneficial owners of the interest and other investment income in the periods concerned,
as well as the certification that they are subject to taxation. The reduction may apply at source or through
the refund of the excess tax. The standard forms currently applicable for these purposes, to be presented
with the document issued by the competent tax authorities, were approved by Order ("Despacho") No.
4743-A/2008 (second series), as rectified on 29 February 2008, published in the Portuguese official
gazette, second series, No. 43, of 29 February 2008, of the Portuguese Minister of Finance and may be
available for viewing and downloading at www.portaldasfinancas.gov.pt.

Interest paid to an associated company of the Bank which is resident in the European Union is exempt
from withholding tax.

For these purposes, an "associated company of the Bank" is:

(a) a company which is subject to one of the taxes on profits listed in Article 3(a)(iii) of Council
Directive 2003/49/EC without being exempt, which takes one of the forms listed in the Annex
to that Directive, which is considered to be resident in a Member State of the European Union
and is not, within the meaning of a double taxation convention on income concluded with a
third state, considered to be resident for tax purposes outside the European Community; and

(b) which holds a minimum direct holding of 25% in capital of the Bank, or is directly held by the
Bank in at least 25% or which is directly held in at least 25% by a company which also holds
at least 25% of the capital of the Bank; and

(c) provided that the holding has been maintained for an uninterrupted period of at least two years.
If the minimum holding period is met after the date the withholding tax becomes due, a refund
may be obtained.

The associated company of the Bank to which payments are made must be the beneficial owner of the
interest, which will be the case if it receives the interest for its own benefit and not as an intermediary,
either as a representative, a trustee or authorised signatory, for some other person.

Capital gains obtained on the disposal or the refund of the Notes by an individual non-resident in
Portugal for tax purposes are subject to Portuguese capital gains taxation on the (annual) positive
difference between such gains and gains on other securities and losses in securities. Tax applies at 28%.
An exemption applies to non-resident individuals, unless they are resident in a country, territory or
region included in Ministerial Order No. 150/2004. Under the tax treaties entered into by Portugal, such
gains are usually not subject to Portuguese tax, but the applicable rules should be confirmed on a case
by case basis.

Gains obtained on the disposal or the refund of Notes by a legal person non-resident in Portugal for tax
purposes and without a permanent establishment in Portugal to which gains are attributable are exempt
from Portuguese capital gains taxation, unless the share capital of the holder is (a) more than 25%
directly or indirectly, held by Portuguese resident entities or (b) if the holder is resident in a country,
territory or region subject to a clearly more favourable tax regime included in Ministerial Order No.

230


-----

150/2004. Under the tax treaties entered into by Portugal, such gains are usually not subject to
Portuguese tax, but the applicable rules should be confirmed on a case by case basis.

No stamp tax applies to the acquisition through gift and inheritance of Notes by an individual who is
not domiciled in Portugal.

The acquisition of Notes through gift or inheritance by a non-resident legal person is subject to corporate
tax at 25%. Under the tax treaties entered into by Portugal, such gains are usually not subject to
Portuguese tax, but the applicable rules should be confirmed on a case-by-case basis.

There is neither wealth nor estate tax in Portugal.

_Notes held through a centralised control system_

The regime described above corresponds to the general tax treatment of investment income and capital
gains on the Notes and to the acquisition through gift or inheritance of such Notes.

Nevertheless, pursuant to the Special Taxation Regime for Debt Securities approved by Decree-law No.
193/2005, of 7 November 2005, as amended from time to time (hereafter "the special regime approved
**by Decree-Law No. 193/2005"), investment income and gains on the disposal or the refund of debt**
securities issued by Portuguese resident entities, such as the Notes, may be exempt from Portuguese
income tax, provided that the debt securities are integrated in a centralised system managed by
Portuguese resident entities (such as the Central de Valores Mobiliários, managed by Interbolsa), by
other European Union or EEA entities that manage international clearing systems (in the latter case if
there is administrative co-operation for tax purposes with the relevant country which is equivalent to
that in place within the European Union), or, when authorised by the member of the government in
charge of finance (currently the Finance Minister), in other centralised systems and:

(a) the beneficial owners have no residence, head office, effective management or permanent
establishment in the Portuguese territory to which the income is attributable; and

(b) the beneficial owners are central banks and government agencies, international organisations
recognised by the Portuguese state, residents in a country or jurisdiction with which Portugal
has entered into a double tax treaty or a tax information exchange agreement in force or other
non–resident entities which are not domiciled in a country, territory or region subject to a
clearly more favourable tax regime included in Ministerial Order No. 150/2004.

The special regime approved by Decree-law No. 193/2005 sets out the detailed rules and procedures to
be followed on the proof of non-residence by the holders of Notes to which it applies.

Under these rules, the direct register entity is to obtain and keep proof, in the form described below,
that the beneficial owner is a non-resident entity that is entitled to the exemption. As a general rule, the
proof of non-residence by the holders of Notes should be provided to, and received by, the direct register
entities prior to the relevant date for payment of any interest, or the redemption date (for Zero Coupon
Notes), and, in the case of domestically cleared Notes, prior to the transfer of Notes, as the case may
be. For the avoidance of doubt is it envisaged that the Notes will be integrated in a centralised system
managed by a Portuguese domestic entity (Interbolsa).

The following is a general description of the rules and procedures on the proof required for the
exemption to apply at source, as they stand on the date of this Offering Circular.

231


-----

_Domestically Cleared Notes_

The beneficial owner of Notes must provide proof of non-residence in Portuguese territory substantially
in the terms set forth below.

(a) If a holder of Notes is a central bank, a public law entity or agency or an international
organisation recognised by the Portuguese state, a declaration of tax residence issued by the
holder of Notes, duly signed and authenticated or proof pursuant to sub-paragraph (d) below;

(b) If the beneficial owner of Notes is a credit institution, a financial company, pension fund or an
insurance company domiciled in any OECD country or in a country or jurisdiction with which
Portugal has entered into a double taxation treaty, and is subject to a special supervision regime
or administrative registration, certification shall be made by means of the following: (A) its tax
identification; or (B) a certificate issued by the entity responsible for such supervision or
registration or by the tax authorities confirming the legal existence of the holder of Notes and
its domicile; or (C) proof of non-residence, pursuant to the terms of sub-paragraph (d) below;

(c) If the beneficial owner of Notes is either an investment fund or other type of collective
investment undertaking domiciled in any OECD country or any country or jurisdiction with
which Portugal has entered into a double tax treaty or a tax information exchange agreement in
force, certification shall be provided by means of any of the following documents: (A)
declaration issued by the entity which is responsible for its registration or supervision or by the
tax authorities, confirming its legal existence and the law of incorporation; or (B) proof of nonresidence pursuant to the terms of sub-paragraph (d) below;

(d) In any other case, confirmation must be made by way of (A) a certificate of residence or
equivalent document issued by the relevant tax authorities, or (B) a document issued by the
relevant Portuguese consulate certifying residence abroad, or (C) a document specifically
issued by an official entity of the public administration (either central, regional or peripheral,
indirect or autonomous) of the relevant country certifying the residence; for these purposes, an
identification document such as a passport or an identity card or document by means of which
it is only indirectly possible to assume the relevant tax residence (such as a work or permanent
residency permit) is not acceptable.

There are rules on the authenticity and validity of the documents mentioned in sub-paragraph (d) above,
in particular that the holder of Notes must provide an original or a certified copy of the residence
certificate or equivalent document. This document must be issued up to until three months after the date
on which the withholding tax would have been applied and will be valid for a 3-year period starting on
the date such document is issued. The holder of Notes must inform the register entity immediately of
any change that may preclude the tax exemption from applying.

In what concerns the documents mentioned in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c) above, proof of non-residence
is required only once, the beneficial owner having to inform the register entity of any changes that
impact the entitlement to the exemption.

_Internationally Cleared Notes_

If the Notes are registered in an account with an international clearing system, prior to the relevant date
for payment of any interest or the redemption date (for Zero Coupon Notes), the entity managing such
system is to provide to the direct register entity or its representative the identification and number of
securities, as well as the income and, when applicable, the tax withheld, itemised by type of beneficial
owner, as follows: (i) Portuguese resident entities or permanent establishments of non-resident entities
to which the income is attributable which are not exempt from tax and are subject to withholding tax;

232


-----

(ii) Entities domiciled in a country, territory, or region subject to a clearly more favourable tax regime
included in Ministerial Order No. 150/2004, which are not exempt from tax and are subject to
withholding tax ; (iii) Portuguese resident entities or permanent establishments of non-resident entities
to which the income is attributable which are exempt from tax and are not subject to withholding tax;
(iv) other non-Portuguese resident entities.

In addition, the international clearing system managing entity is to provide to the direct register entity,
in relation to each income payment, at least the following information concerning each of the
beneficiaries mentioned in items (i), (ii) and (iii) above: name and address, tax identification number,
if applicable, identification of the securities held and amount thereof and amount of income.

No Portuguese exemption shall apply at source under the special regime approved by Decree-Law No.
193/2005 if the above rules and procedures are not followed. Accordingly, the general Portuguese tax
provisions shall apply as described above.

If the conditions for an exemption to apply are met, but, due to inaccurate or insufficient information,
tax is withheld, a special refund procedure is available under the regime approved by Decree-Law No.
193/2005.

The refund claim is to be submitted to the direct or indirect register entity of the Notes within 6 months
from the date the withholding took place.

The refund of withholding tax in other circumstances or after the above 6 months period is to be claimed
to the Portuguese Tax Authorities within 2 years from the end of the year in which tax was withheld.
The refund is to be made within 3 months, after which interest is due.

The forms currently applicable for the above purposes were approved by Order ("Despacho") No.

**2.** **United Kingdom Taxation**

**_The following is a summary of the Issuer's understanding of current United Kingdom law and_**
**_published HM Revenue and Customs' practice relating only to the United Kingdom withholding tax_**
**_treatment of payments of interest (as that term is understood for United Kingdom tax purposes) in_**
**_respect of Notes. It does not deal with any other United Kingdom taxation implications of acquiring,_**
**_holding or disposing of Notes. The United Kingdom tax treatment of prospective Noteholders depends_**
**_on their individual circumstances and may be subject to change in the future. Prospective_**
**_Noteholders who may be subject to tax in a jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom or who may_**
**_be unsure as to their tax position should seek their own professional advice._**

Payments of interest on the Notes that does not have a United Kingdom source may be made without
deduction or withholding on account of United Kingdom income tax. If interest paid on the Notes does
have a United Kingdom source, then payments may be made without deduction or withholding on
account of United Kingdom income tax in any of the following circumstances.

The Issuer will be entitled to make payments of interest on the Notes without deduction of or
withholding on account of United Kingdom income tax provided that:

(a) the Issuer is and continues to be a bank within the meaning of section 991 of the Income Tax
Act 2007 ("ITA 2007"); and

233


-----

(b) the interest on the Notes is and continues to be paid in the ordinary course of the Issuer's
business within the meaning of section 878 ITA 2007.

Payments of interest on the Notes may be made without deduction of or withholding on account of
United Kingdom income tax provided that the Notes carry a right to interest and the Notes are and
continue to be listed on a "recognised stock exchange" within the meaning of section 1005 of the Income
Tax Act 2007. Provided, therefore, that the Notes carry a right to interest and are and remain listed on
a "recognised stock exchange", interest on the Notes will be payable without deduction of or
withholding on account of United Kingdom tax.

In other cases, an amount must generally be withheld from payments of interest on the Notes that has a
United Kingdom source on account of United Kingdom income tax at the basic rate (currently 20%),
subject to any other available exemptions and reliefs. However, where an applicable double tax treaty
provides for a lower rate of withholding tax (or for no tax to be withheld) in relation to a Noteholder,
HMRC can issue a notice to the Issuer to pay interest to the Noteholder without deduction of tax (or for
interest to be paid with tax deducted at the rate provided for in the relevant double tax treaty).

**3.** **Irish Taxation**

The following is a summary of the Irish withholding tax treatment of the Notes. It is based on the laws
and practice of the Revenue Commissioners of Ireland currently in force in Ireland as at the date of this
Offering Circular and may be subject to change. The summary does not purport to be a comprehensive
description of all of the Irish tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase, own or
dispose of the Notes. The summary does not constitute tax or legal advice and the comments below are
of a general nature only and it does not discuss all aspects of Irish taxation that may be relevant to any
particular holder of Notes. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their professional advisers
on the tax implications of the purchase, holding, redemption or sale of the Notes and the receipt of
payments thereon under any laws applicable to them.

(a) Withholding Tax

In general, tax at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20%), is required to be withheld
from payments of Irish source income. The Issuer will not be obliged to withhold Irish income
tax from payments of interest on the Notes so long as such payments do not constitute Irish
source income. Interest paid on the Notes should not be treated as having an Irish source unless:

(i) The Issuer is resident in Ireland for tax purposes; or

(ii) the Issuer has a branch or permanent establishment in Ireland, the assets or income of
which is used to fund the payments on the Notes; or

(iii) the Issuer is not resident in Ireland for tax purposes but the register for the Notes is
maintained in Ireland or (if the Notes are in bearer form) the Notes are physically held
in Ireland.

It is anticipated that, (A) the Issuer is not and will not be resident in Ireland for tax purposes;
(B) the Issuer will not have a branch or permanent establishment in Ireland; (C) that bearer
Notes will not be physically located in Ireland; and (D) the Issuer will not maintain a register
of any registered Notes in Ireland.

In any event, an exemption from withholding on interest payments exists under Section 64 of
the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 of Ireland for certain interest bearing securities ("quoted

234


-----

**Eurobonds") issued by a body corporate (such as the Issuer) which are quoted on a recognised**
stock exchange (which would include Euronext Dublin).

Any interest paid on such quoted Eurobonds can be paid free of withholding tax provided:

(A) the person by or through whom the payment is made is not in Ireland; or

(B) the payment is made by or through a person in Ireland, and either:

(I) the quoted Eurobond is held in a clearing system recognised by the Irish
Revenue Commissioners (Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg are so
recognised), or

(II) the person who is the beneficial owner of the quoted Eurobond and who is
beneficially entitled to the interest is not resident in Ireland and has made a
declaration to a relevant person (such as an Irish paying agent) in the prescribed
form.

So long as the Notes are quoted on a recognised stock exchange and are held in
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, interest on the Notes can be paid by the
Issuer and any paying agent acting on behalf of the Issuer without any withholding or
deduction for or on account of Irish income tax.

(b) Taxation of Noteholders

Notwithstanding that a Noteholder may receive interest on the Notes free of withholding tax,
the Noteholder may still be liable to pay Irish income or corporation tax (and, in the case of
individuals, the universal social charge) on such interest if (i) such interest has an Irish source
(as discussed in 'Withholding Tax' above), (ii) the Noteholder is resident or (in the case of a
person other than a body corporate) ordinarily resident in Ireland for tax purposes (in which
case there would also be a social insurance (PRSI) liability for an individual in receipt of interest
on the Notes) or (iii) the Notes are attributed to a branch or agency in Ireland.

However, interest on the Notes will be exempt from Irish income tax if the recipient of the
interest is resident in a relevant territory (a member state of the European Union (other than
Ireland) or in a country with which Ireland has a comprehensive double taxation agreement)
provided either (A) the Notes are quoted Eurobonds and are exempt from withholding tax as
set out above (B) if the Notes are not or cease to be quoted Eurobonds exempt from withholding
tax and the recipient of the interest is a company resident in a relevant territory that generally
taxes foreign source interest.

Ireland operates a self-assessment system in respect of income and corporation tax and each
person must assess its own liability to Irish tax.

(c) Withholding of Irish Encashment Tax

Payments on any Notes paid by a paying agent in Ireland or collected or realised by an agent in
Ireland acting on behalf of the beneficial owner of Notes will be subject to Irish encashment
tax at the standard rate of Irish tax (currently 20%), unless it is proved, on a claim made in the
required manner to the Revenue Commissioners of Ireland, that the beneficial owner of the
Notes entitled to the interest or distribution is not resident in Ireland for the purposes of Irish
tax and such interest or distribution is not deemed, under the provisions of Irish tax legislation,
to be income of another person that is resident in Ireland.

**4.** **Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ("FATCA") impose a
new reporting regime and, potentially, a 30% withholding tax with respect to: (i) certain
payments from sources within the United States, (ii) "foreign passthru payments" made to
certain non-U.S. financial institutions that do not comply with this new reporting regime, and
(iii) payments to certain investors that do not provide identification information with respect to
interests issued by a participating non-U.S. financial institution. FATCA may affect payments
made to custodians or intermediaries in the subsequent payment chain leading to the ultimate
investor if any such custodian or intermediary generally is unable to receive payments free of
FATCA withholding. It may also affect payment to any ultimate investor that fails to provide
its broker (or other custodian or intermediary from which it receives payment) with any
information, forms, other documentation or consents that may be necessary for the payments
to be made free of FATCA withholding.

Investors should choose the custodians or intermediaries with care (to ensure each is compliant
with FATCA or other laws or agreements related to FATCA) and provide each custodian or
intermediary with any information, forms, other documentation or consents that may be
necessary for such custodian or intermediary to make a payment free of FATCA withholding.
Investors should consult their own tax advisor to obtain a more detailed explanation of FATCA
and how FATCA may affect them. The Issuer’s obligations under the Notes are discharged
once it has made payment via the Interbolsa system and the Issuer therefore has no
responsibility for any amount thereafter transmitted through Euroclear and Clearstream,
Luxembourg or Interbolsa and custodians or intermediaries. Further, foreign financial
institutions in a jurisdiction which has entered into an intergovernmental agreement with the
United States (an "IGA") are generally not expected to be required to withhold under FATCA
or an IGA (or any law implementing an IGA) form payments they make.

Portugal signed an IGA with the United States on 6 August 2015 and has implemented through
Law No. 82-B/2014, of 31 December 2014 (as amended), the legal framework based on the
reciprocal exchange of information with the United States on financial accounts subject to
disclosure. The IGA entered into force in 10 August 2016, and through Decree-Law No.
64/2016, of 11 October 2016, amended by Law No. 98/2017, of 24 August 2017 and Law No.
17/2019 of 14 February 2019, the Portuguese government approved the regulation required to
comply with FATCA. Under this legislation, the Issuer is required to obtain information
regarding certain accountholders and report such information to the Portuguese Tax
Authorities, which, in turn, will report such information to the US Internal Revenue Service.
The exchange of information shall be made by 31 July of each year comprising the information
gathered respecting the previous year.

Holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding how these rules may apply to their
investment in Notes. In the event any withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or an
IGA with respect to payments on the Notes, no person will be required to pay additional
amounts as a result of the withholding.

**5.** **The proposed financial transactions tax ("FTT")**

On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the "Commission's
**Proposal") for a Directive for a FTT in Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Italy,**
Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia (the "participating Member States") and Estonia.
However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate.

236


-----

Currently, after the withdrawal of the Republic of Estonia as a Member State wishing to
participate in the establishment of the enhanced cooperation, ten countries are participating in
the negotiations on the proposed directive. At the working party meeting of 7 May 2019,
participating Member States indicated that they were discussing the option of an FTT based on
the French model of the tax, and the possible mutualisation of the revenues among the
participating member states as a contribution to the EU budget.

The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member States. It
may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear.
Additional European Union Member States may decide to participate. Prospective holders of
Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

**6.** **Administrative co-operation in the field of taxation**

Council Directive 2011/16/EU, as amended by Council Directive 2014/107/EU, of 9 December
2014, introduced the automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation concerning
bank accounts and is in accordance with the Global Standard released by the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development in July 2014 (the Common Reporting Standard).

Portugal has implemented Directive 2011/16/EU through Decree-Law No. 61/2013, of 10 May
2013, as amended by Decree-Law No. 64/2016, of 11 October 2016, Law No. 98/2017, of 24
August 2017, and Law No. 17/2019, of 14 February 2019.

The Council Directive 2014/107/EU, of 9 December 2014, regarding the mandatory automatic
exchange of information in the field of taxation was also transposed into the Portuguese law
through the Decree-Law No. 64/2016, of 11 October 2016, as amended, Law No. 98/2017, of
24 August 2017, and Law No. 17/2019, of 14 February 2019. Under such law, the Issuer is
required to collect information regarding certain accountholders and report such information to
Portuguese Tax Authorities – which, in turn, will report such information to the relevant tax
authorities of EU Member States or third States which have signed the Multilateral Competent
Authority Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information for the
Common Reporting Standard. Law no. 17/2019, of 14 February 2019 introduced the regime for
the automatic exchange of financial information to be carried out by financial institutions to the
Portuguese Tax Authority (until July 31, with reference to the previous year) with respect to
accounts held by holders or beneficiaries resident in the Portuguese territory with a balance or
value that exceeds EUR 50,000 (assessed at the end of each civil year). This regime covers
information related to years 2018 and following years.

Under Council Directive 2014/107/EU, of 9 December 2014, financial institutions are required
to report to the tax authorities of their respective Member State (for the exchange of information
with the state of residence) information regarding bank accounts, including custodial accounts,
held by individual persons residing in a different Member State or entities which are controlled
by one or more individual persons residing in a different Member State, after having applied
the due diligence rules foreseen in the Directive. The information refers to the account balance
at the end of the calendar year, income paid or credited in the account and the proceeds from
the sale or redemption of the financial assets paid or credited in the account during the calendar
year to which the financial institution acted as custodian, broker, nominee, or otherwise as an
agent for the account holder, among others.

In view of the regime enacted by Decree-Law No. 64/2016, of 11 October 2016, which was
amended by Law No. 98/2017, of 24 August 2017, and Law No. 17/2019, of 14 February 2019,
all information regarding the registration of the financial institution, the procedures to comply
with the reporting obligations arising thereof and the applicable forms were approved by

**CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT**

_To the best of the knowledge of the Bank (having taken all reasonable care to ensure that such is the_
_case), the information in this section concerning Interbolsa is correct as of the date of this Offering_
_Circular. The information set out below is subject to any change in or reinterpretation of the rules,_
_regulations and procedures of Interbolsa currently in effect. Investors wishing to use the facilities of_
_Interbolsa are advised to confirm the continued applicability of the rules, regulations and procedures_
_of Interbolsa. The Issuer, any agent party to the Agency Terms, the Arranger or any of the Dealers will_
_have no responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account_
_of beneficial ownership interests in the Notes held through the facilities of Interbolsa or for maintaining,_
_supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests._

_General_

Interbolsa holds security through a centralised system (sistema centralizado) composed by
interconnected securities accounts, through which such securities (and inherent rights) are held and
transferred, and which allows Interbolsa to control at all times the amount of securities so held and
transferred. The centralised securities system of Interbolsa provides for all procedures required for the
exercise of ownership rights inherent to the Notes.

In relation to each issue of securities, Interbolsa's centralised system comprises, inter alia, (a) the issue
account, opened by the Issuer in the centralised system and which reflects the full amount of issued
securities; and (b) the control accounts opened by each of the financial intermediaries which participate
in Interbolsa's centralised system, and which reflect the securities held by such participant on behalf of
its customers in accordance with its individual securities accounts.

Notes will be attributed an International Securities Identification Number code ("ISIN") through the
codification system of Interbolsa (and if applicable any other relevant financial instrument codes, such
as a Classification of Financial Instruments code ("CFI") and a Financial Instrument Short Name code
("FISN")). Notes will be accepted and registered with Central de Valores Mobiliários, the centralised
securities system managed and operated by Interbolsa and settled by Interbolsa's settlement system.

_Form of the Notes_

The Notes of each Series will be in book entry form and title to the Notes will be evidenced by book
entries in accordance with the provisions of the Portuguese Securities Code (Código dos Valores
_Mobiliários) and the applicable CMVM and Interbolsa regulations. No physical document of title will_
be issued in respect of the Notes.

The Notes of each Series will be registered in the relevant issue account opened by the Issuer with
Interbolsa and will be held in control accounts by each Interbolsa Participant (as defined below) on
behalf of the holders of the Notes. Such control accounts reflect at all times the aggregate of Notes held
in the individual securities accounts opened by the holders of the Notes with each of the Interbolsa
Participants. The expression "Interbolsa Participant" means any authorised financial intermediary
entitled to hold control accounts with Interbolsa on behalf of their customers and includes any
depositary banks appointed by Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg for the purpose of holding
accounts on behalf of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg.

Each person shown in the records of an Interbolsa Participant as having an interest in Notes shall be
treated as the holder of the principal amount of the Notes recorded therein.

Payment of principal and interest in respect of Notes

239


-----

Payment of principal and interest in respect of the Notes will be (i) credited, according to the procedures
and regulations of Interbolsa, by the Agent (acting on behalf of the Issuer) to the accounts used by the
Interbolsa Participants for payments in respect of securities held through Interbolsa and thereafter (ii)
credited by such Interbolsa Participants from the aforementioned accounts to the accounts of the owners
of those Notes or through Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg to the accounts with Euroclear and
Clearstream, Luxembourg of the beneficial owners of those Notes, in accordance with the rules and
procedures of Interbolsa, Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be.

_Transfer of Notes_

Notes may, subject to compliance with all applicable rules, restrictions and requirements of Interbolsa
and Portuguese law, be transferred to a person who wishes to hold such Notes. No owner of Notes will
be able to transfer such Notes, except in accordance with Portuguese Law and the applicable procedures
of Interbolsa.

**SUBSCRIPTION AND SALE AND TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

The Programme Dealers, pursuant to an amended and restated dealer agreement dated 26 May 2020 (as
amended, restated or supplemented from time to time, the "Dealer Agreement"), have agreed with the
Issuer on the terms upon which any one or more of the Programme Dealers may from time to time agree
to purchase (as principal, unless the applicable Final Terms states otherwise) Notes. Any such
agreement will extend to those matters stated under "Form of the Notes"; "Form of Final Terms"; and
"

241


-----

_Terms and Conditions of the Notes" above. In the Dealer Agreement, the Issuer has agreed to reimburse_
the Programme Dealers for certain of their expenses in connection with the establishment and any future
update of the Programme and the issue of Notes under the Programme. The Issuer may also agree to
issue Notes to Issue Dealers who shall enter into the Dealer Agreement with the Issuer for the purpose
only of a particular issue or issues of Notes under the Programme on, and subject to, the terms of the
Dealer Agreement. Dealers will be entitled in certain circumstances to be released from their obligations
under the Dealer Agreement in respect of the issue and purchase of Notes under the Programme.

**United States**

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of
any state or other jurisdiction of the United States, and may not be offered or sold within the United
States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except in certain transactions exempt from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings
given to them by Regulation S under the Securities Act.

The applicable Final Terms will identify whether TEFRA C rules apply or whether TEFRA is not
applicable. If TEFRA C applies, the Notes are subject to U.S. tax law requirements and may not be
offered, sold or delivered within the United States or its possessions or to a United States person, except
in certain transactions permitted by U.S. Treasury regulations. Terms used in this paragraph have the
meanings given to them by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and Treasury regulations
promulgated thereunder.

Each Dealer has represented and agreed, and each further Dealer appointed under the Programme will
be required to represent and agree, that it will not offer, sell or deliver Notes (a) as part of their
distribution at any time or (b) otherwise until 40 days after the completion of the distribution of all
Notes of the Tranche of which such Notes are a part of all Notes of the Tranche of which such Notes
are a part, within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Each Dealer has
further agreed, and each further Dealer appointed under the Programme will be required to agree, that
it will send to each dealer to which it sells any Notes during the distribution compliance period a
confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the
United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms used in this paragraph have
the meanings given to them by Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Until 40 days after the commencement of the offering of any Series of Notes, an offer or sale of such
Notes within the United States by any dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate
the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in
accordance with an available exemption from registration under the Securities Act.

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA and UK Retail Investors**

Unless the Final Terms in respect of any Notes specifies "Prohibition of Sales to EEA and UK Retail
Investors" or "Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors" (as the case may be) as "Not Applicable",
each Dealer has represented and agreed, and each further Dealer appointed under the Programme will
be required to represent and agree, that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not

Regulation); and

(b) the expression an "offer" includes the communication in any form and by any means of
sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an
investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Notes.

If the Final Terms in respect of any Notes specifies "Prohibition of Sales to EEA and UK Retail
Investors" or "Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors" (as the case may be) as "Not Applicable",
in relation to each Member State of the EEA and the United Kingdom (as applicable) (each, a "Relevant
**State"), each Programme Dealer has represented and agreed, and each further Programme Dealer or**
Issue Dealer appointed under the Programme will be required to represent and agree, that it has not
made and will not make an offer of Notes which are the subject of the offering contemplated by this
Offering Circular as completed by the final terms in relation thereto to the public in that Relevant State,
except that it may make an offer of such Notes to the public in that Relevant State:

a prospectus pursuant to Article 23 of the Prospectus Regulation.

For the purposes of this provision, the expression an "offer of Notes to the public" in relation to any
Notes in any Relevant State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient
information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide
to purchase or subscribe for the Notes and the expression "Prospectus Regulation" means Regulation
(EU) 2017/1129, as amended from time to time.

the Bank or Banco Comercial Português Group since the date of the last audited annual accounts, 31
December 2019.

**Litigation**

1. In 2012, the Portuguese Competition Authority initiated an administrative proceeding relating to
competition restrictive practices. During the investigations, on 6 March 2013, several searches
were conducted in the Bank's premises, as well as to at least eight other credit institutions, where
documentation was seized in order to investigate allegations of exchange of privileged
commercial information among Portuguese banks.

The Portuguese Competition Authority has declared the administrative proceeding to stay under
judicial secrecy, once it considered that the interests dealt with in the investigation, as well as the
parties' rights, would not be compatible with the publicity of the process. On 2 June 2015, the
Bank was notified of the Portuguese Competition Authority's notice of illegality in connection
with an administrative offence, by which the Bank is accused of participating in an information
exchange between banks of the system related to prices already approved and housing and
consumer credit operations already granted or approved. In light of the accusations, the Bank
filed a response to the note of illegality, to which may follow a judicial appeal. Note that the
notification of a note of illegality does not constitute a final decision in relation to the accusations.
According to the terms foreseen in the law, the illicit under investigation in this administrative
proceeding may be punished with a fine up to a maximum limit of 10% of the defendant's annual
consolidated turnover with reference to the year preceding the decision. However, judicial appeal
against such decision is possible. In October 2016, the Lisbon Court of Appeals overruled an

248


-----

earlier decision by the Competition, Regulation and Supervision Court to suspend the
Competition Authority's investigation.

On 4 July 2017, the Competition Authority notified the Bank on the decision regarding the
withdrawal of the suspension concerning the access to documents deemed as confidential and of
the extension of the term for the making of a decision on the illicit act for more 40 days. The
Portuguese Competition Authority refused the Bank's application for confidential treatment of
some of the information in the Bank's defence against the notice of illegal act. In June 2018 the
Bank filed an appeal with the Portuguese Competition, Regulation and Supervision Court (which
is pending) and filed its defence against the notice of illegal act in a non-confidential version.

On 5 November 2018, the Bank was notified of the ruling of the Portuguese Competition,
Regulation and Supervision Court, that gives approval to the appeal presented by BCP, on the
subject of secrecy, accepting, in its essence, BCP's argument that the Portuguese Competition
Authority, infringed on the right to a prior hearing.

On 25 January 2019, the PCA granted the Bank a 10-business day period to provide summaries
for the co-defendants' confidential information. On 4 February 2019, the Bank filed an appeal
before the Competition Court and, on 11 February 2019, submitted a reply to the PCA (although
restating its opposition to the PCA's request).

On 9 September 2019, the PCA adopted its final decision on this proceeding, fining BCP in EUR
60 million for its alleged participation in a confidential information exchange system with its
competitors in the mortgage, consumer and small and medium enterprises credit segments. The
Bank considers that this decision contains serious factual and legal errors, having filed an appeal
on 21 October 2019 before the Competition Court requesting the annulation of the decision and
the suspensive effect of the appeal. The admission of the appeal and the decision on its respective
effect are expected.

2. On 20 October 2014, the Bank became aware of a class action brought against Bank Millennium
in Poland by a group of borrowers represented by the Municipal Consumer Ombudsman in
Olsztyn. As other Polish banks in a similar situation, Bank Millennium was in the meantime
notified of such class action, which seeks to assess the institution's "illicit" enrichment from
certain clauses contained in the mortgage loan agreements denominated in Swiss francs. In the
referred class action, clients have questioned a set of those agreements' clauses, notably those
related with the spread bid-offer between Polish zloty and Swiss francs applicable in the
conversion of credits. On 28 May 2015, the Regional Court of Warsaw issued a decision rejecting
the class action on the grounds that the case cannot be heard in class action proceedings. The
decision of the Regional Court of Warsaw is not final. On 3 July 2015, the claimants filed an
appeal against this decision and the Court of Appeal upheld the appeal by refusing the dismissal
of the claim.

On 31 March 2016, the Regional Court in Warsaw issued a decision dismissing the Bank's motion
for a security deposit to secure litigation costs. On 6 April 2016, the Bank filed an appeal against
this decision.

On 17 February 2016, the claimant filed a submission with the Regional Court in Warsaw,
extending the claim again to include 1,041 group members. Bank Millennium has not yet been
notified of this submission.

On 2 August 2016 the Regional Court in Warsaw issued a decision ordering the publication of
an announcement in the press concerning the commencement of action proceedings. Following
the Bank's motion to repeal this decision, the Court suspended its execution, but, on 8 August

249


-----

2016, it issued another decision for the case to be heard in the group action proceedings. On 31
August 2016, the Bank appealed this decision. On 16 December 2016 the Court of Appeal in
Warsaw overruled decision of the Regional Court for the case to be heard in group action
proceedings and referred the request for the case to be heard in group action proceedings to the
Regional Court for re-examination. At a hearing on 15 March 2017 the Regional Court issued
decision for the case to be heard in group action proceedings. On 18 April 2017 the Bank filed
an appeal against the above decision; the date of reviewing the case by the Court of Appeal in
Warsaw has not been scheduled yet. On 30 June 2017 the claimant filed a submission with the
Regional Court in Warsaw, extending the claim again by a further 676 group members. The new
value of the subject matter of the dispute was indicated as approximately PLN 132.7 million
(approximately EUR 31 million, including the values provided in the statement of claim and the
previous submissions concerning extension of the claims dated 4 March 2015 and 17 February
2016). The submission dated 30 June 2017 extending the claim has not yet been served on the
Bank's counsel. On 28 September 2017 the Court of Appeal in Warsaw issued a decision
dismissing the Bank's appeal against the decision of the Regional Court in Warsaw dated 15
March 2017; thus, the decision for the case to be heard in group action proceedings became final.
On 20 November 2017 the Regional Court in Warsaw issued a decision ordering the publication
of an announcement in the "Rzeczpospolita" newspaper concerning the commencement of group
action proceedings. The announcement was published on 23 January 2018; the deadline for
further borrowers to join the proceedings was 23 April 2018.

In the last extension of claim (dated 24 April 2018), 382 new borrowers declared their accession
to the group. Including all previous extensions of claim, the total number of declared members
of the group is currently approximately 5,400 persons, while the total value of the subject matter
of the dispute was indicated as approximately PLN 146 million (approximately EUR 34 million).

On 14 January 2019, the Regional Court in Warsaw issued a decision on the composition of the
group. Both parties appealed against this decision. On 27 August 2019, the Court of Appeal in
Warsaw issued a final decision on the composition of the group. The proceedings have thus
entered the phase of reviewing the case on the merits. The date of the hearing was scheduled for
20 March 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the hearing was cancelled. The date of the next
hearing is not yet set.

Currently, the number of the group members is 5.350 and the value of the litigation has been
estimated to approximately PLN 146 million. The number of loan agreements involved is 3,281.

On 3 December 2015, Bank Millennium received notice of a class action lawsuit lodged by a
group of 454 borrowers represented by the Municipal Consumer Ombudsman in Olsztyn
pertaining to low down payment insurance used with CHF-indexed mortgage loans. The
plaintiffs demand the payment of the amount of PLN 3.5 million (approximately EUR 0.83
million) claiming for some clauses of the agreements pertaining to low down-payment insurance
to be declared null and void. The Bank already contested the claim, demanding that the lawsuit
be dismissed. The first hearing took place on 13 September 2016, the Court having ruled that the
proceedings were admitted. On 16 February 2017, the Court of Appeal denied the appeal brought
forward by the Bank and the previous sentence became definitive. On 30 March 2017 the
Regional Court in Warsaw dismissed Bank's motion to oblige the plaintiff to provide security for
costs of proceedings. On 10 April 2017 Bank filed a complaint to the Court of Appeal in Warsaw
against the decision dismissing the motion to provide security. On 13 September 2017, the Court
of Appeal in Warsaw dismissed the complaint against the decision of the Regional Court in
Warsaw of 30 March 2017 on dismissal of the motion to provide security. The Regional Court
in Warsaw announced the initiation of group proceedings in the daily newspaper
"Rzeczpospolita", thus setting a period of three months for submitting statements on joining the
group by the interested parties. Pursuant to the court´s order, the representative of the group filed

250


-----

with the Regional Court in Warsaw an update list of all the members of the group amounting to
709 persons and lodged a further claim for slightly above 5 million PLN altogether.

On 1 October 2018, the group's representative corrected the total amount of claims pursued in
the proceedings and submitted a revised list of all group members, covering a total of 697
borrowers and 432 loan agreements. The value of the subject of the dispute, as updated by the
claimant, is PLN 7,371,107.94.

On 21 November 2018, the Bank filed objections regarding the membership of individual persons
in the group. The court also ordered the Bank to submit its objections as to the revised list of all
group members by 28 January 2019.

The next stage of the proceedings is establishing the composition of the group (i.e. determining
whether all persons who joined the proceedings may participate in the group).

On 28 January 2019, the Bank submitted second objection regarding the membership in the group
of persons included in the revised list. On 27 July 2019, the Bank filed a motion to exclude a
judge from the case. On 26 October 2019, the court issued a decision to exclude three judges
from hearing the case.

On 1 April 2020, the court issued a decision on establishing the composition of the group and
determined that all persons indicated by the plaintiff are allowed to participate in the group. The
decision is not final and has not yet been officially delivered to the Bank. Upon an official service
of the decision, the Bank will have the right to file an appeal.

3. On 28 December 2015 and 5 April 2016, Bank Millennium was notified of two cases filed by
PCZ SA in the amount of PLN 150 million (approximately EUR 34.3 million) and by Europejska
Fundacja Współpracy Polsko - Belgijskiej / European Foundation for Polish-Belgian
Cooperation ("EFWP-B"), in the amount of PLN 521.9 million (approximately EUR 119.4
million) based on the same grounds. The claimants allege in their petitions that Bank Millennium
misrepresented certain contractual clauses, which determined the maturity of the credits, causing
losses to the claimants. In the case brought by EFWP-B a decision of the first instance of the
Warsaw Regional Court is pending. As regards the case brought by PCZ SA, on 7 April 2017
the Wrocław Regional Court (first instance) issued a verdict favourable to Bank Millennium by
rejecting the case. The plaintiff has lodged an appeal. On 21 December 2017, the Appeal Court
of second instance in Wrocław has issued a verdict favourable to the Bank dismissing the appeal.
This decision is final.

The Bank is requesting complete dismissal of the suit, stating disagreement with the charges
raised in the claim. Supporting the position of the Bank, the Bank's attorney submitted a binding
copy of final verdict of Appeal Court in Wrocław favourable to the Bank, issued in the same legal
state in the action brought by PCZ S.A. against the Bank.

Favourable forecasts for the Bank, as regards dismissal of the suit brought by EFWP-B to the
Warsaw Regional Court, have been confirmed by a renowned law firm representing the Bank in
this proceeding.

4. On 19 January 2018, the Bank has received the lawsuit petition of First Data Polska SA
requesting the payment of PLN 186.8 million (approximately EUR 43.5 million). First Data
claims a share in an amount which the Bank has received in connection with the Visa Europe
takeover transaction by Visa Inc. The plaintiff based its request on an agreement with the Bank
on cooperation in scope of acceptance and settlement of operations conducted with the usage of

251


-----

Visa cards. The Bank does not accept the claim and filed the response to the lawsuit petition
within the deadline set forth in the law.

In accordance with the decision issued on 13 June 2019, the Bank won the case before the Court
of First Instance. The case is currently pending before the Court of Appeal. According to the
current risk estimation of losing the dispute, the Bank has not created a provision in its accounts.

5. On 3 January 2018, Bank Millennium was notified of a decision of the President of the Office of
Competition and Consumer Protection (the "UOKiK"), in which the President of UOKiK found
infringement by the Bank of the rights of consumers. In the opinion of the President of UOKiK,
the essence of the violation was that the Bank informed consumers (connected with 78
agreements), in response to their complaint, that the court verdict stating the abusiveness of the
provisions of the loan agreement regarding exchange rates did not apply to them. According to
the position of the President of UOKiK, the abusiveness of contract's clauses determined by the
court in the course of abstract control is constitutive and effective for every contract from the
beginning. As a result of the decision, the Bank had to: 1) send information of the UOKiK
decision to the said 78 clients; 2) post the information on the decision and the decision itself on
the website and on twitter, which it has already done; and 3) to pay a fine amounting to PLN 20.7
million. The decision on the fine is not immediately enforceable. The decision of the President
of UOKiK is not final. The Bank does not agree with this decision and lodged an appeal within
the statutory time limit.

On 7 January 2020, the first instance court dismissed the Bank's appeal in its entirety. The court
presented the view that the judgment issued in the course of the control of a contractual template
(in the course of an abstract control), recognising the provisions of the template as abusive,
determines the abusiveness of similar provisions in previously concluded contracts. Therefore,
the information provided to consumers was incorrect and misleading. As regards the penalty
imposed by UOKiK, the court pointed out that the policy of imposing penalties by UOKiK had
changed in the direction of tightening penalties and that the court agrees with this direction.

In the Bank's assessment, the court should not assess the Bank's behaviour in 2015 from the
perspective of today's case-law views on the importance of abstract control (it was not until
January 2016 that the Supreme Court's resolution supporting the view of the President of UOKiK
was published), nor should it impose penalties for these behaviours using current policy. The
above constitutes a significant argument against the validity of the judgment and supports the
appeal which the Bank submitted to the Court of Appeal.

6. In October 2015, a set of companies connected to a group which has debts in default towards the
Bank in the amount of approximately EUR 170 million, resulting from a financing agreement
entered into in 2009 – such debts having been fully provisioned for in the Bank's accounts –
brought a judicial proceeding against the Bank, after having received a notification from the Bank
enforcing payment of such debts. In the judicial proceedings it is envisaged:

(a) to deny the obligation of payment of those debts, by arguing the voidness and nullity
of the respective agreement, but without the correspondent obligation of returning the
amounts received;

(b) that the Bank is also convicted to bear the amounts of approximately EUR 90 million
and EUR 34 million related to other debts contracted by those entities with other
banking institutions, as well as the amounts, in a total sum of approximately EUR 26
million, that the debtors would have already paid in the context of the respective
financing agreements; and

252


-----

(c) to declare that the Bank is the owner of the object of the pledges associated with said
financing agreements, which corresponds to approximately 340 million shares of the
Bank itself, allegedly acquired at the request of, on behalf of and in the interest of the
Bank.

The Bank has filed its defence and counterclaim, reinforcing the demand for payment of the debt.
The claimants filed their statements of defence regarding the counterclaim filed by the Bank and
the Bank replied to those statements in July 2016.

The Court issued a decision establishing the facts that are considered to be proven and those that
must still be proven in court. The parties presented their requests for proof and each of the parties
appointed its expert. The Court shall now issue a decision regarding the proof requested by the
parties and appoint the third expert.

The claimants challenged both experts appointed by BCP and the Court, but the Court maintained
the appointed experts, who were notified on 13 March 2020 to proceed with the expert evidence.

The proceedings are waiting for the expert evidence to proceed.

7. In 2013, the Bank filed a lawsuit against a former Chairman of its Board of Directors, his wife
and an insurance company, requesting mainly that the following be recognised: (a) that the
amount of the retirement instalments of the former Chairman, to be paid by the Bank, cannot
exceed the highest fixed remuneration earned by the directors exercising functions in the Bank
at any moment; (b) that the former Chairman cannot maintain, at the Bank's expenses, the unique
benefits he had when still in active functions; and (c) that the wife of the former Chairman cannot
benefit from a survival lifelong pension paid by the Bank in case of death of the former Chairman,
under conditions different from the ones foreseen for the majority of the Bank's employees.

On 25 May 2018 the court rejected the request made by the Bank consisting in the reduction of
the pensions paid and to be paid and partially accepted a counter-claim, sentencing the Bank to
compensate him for certain past and future expenses (that, as incurred as at 16 June 2016, the
court computed in the amount of EUR 2,124,923.97), plus default interest accounted at the legal
rate of 4% per year since the date of the reimbursement request up to their effective and full
payment.

The Bank disagrees with the interpretation adopted by the court and, on 12 July 2018, appealed
to the Lisbon Court of Appeals.

The lower stage court had to annul the sentence mentioned above.

After several procedural extraordinary events, on 27 January 2019, the Court issued a new
decision, which fully reproduces the previous one issued on 25 May 2018 as detailed above.

On 5 March 2020, the Lisbon Court of Appeals abrogated the court of first instance’s decision,
upholding the Bank's legal action and declaring the non-existence of the right of the defendant to
receive the retirement supplements paid by the insurance company, condemning the defendant to
return to the Bank the amounts received monthly in excess of the limits provided for in Article
402 (2) of the Commercial Companies Code, as from the date of retirement. The Court also
enacted the partial nullity of the insurance contracts titled by the capitalisation and lifelong
pension policy, sentencing the insurance company to return to the Bank the amounts paid by the
latter to support the retirement supplements of such former Chairman of the Board of Directors.
Finally, the court dismissed the counterclaim, acquitting the Bank of the request. There may be
an appeal to the Supreme Court of Justice for this last decision.

8. Litigation initiated by BCP and Millennium bim in relation to their exposure to Mozambique
entities and sovereign guarantees:

On 8 April 2020, the Bank filed a Claim in the High Court of Justice Business & Property Courts
of England and Wales Commercial Court in which the Bank claims sums due and in default under
a facility agreement and a sovereign guarantee in the amount of USD 158,942,748.88, as at 8
April 2020, plus other interest and other costs.

Further to legal action brought by the State with a view to seek, inter alia, a declaration that a
State guarantee is not valid, legal or enforceable, on 27 April 2020 Millennium bim issued a
Claim in the High Court of Justice Business & Property Courts of England and Wales
Commercial Court against the original arranger and lender of a credit facility benefiting from
said State guarantee and related persons. Millennium bim was assigned loans under this facility
in the amounts of USD 37.2 million and USD 24 million. The total amount outstanding as at 27
April 2020 was US$79,639,385.33.

Save as disclosed in this section entitled "Litigation" there are no, nor have there been any
governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any such proceedings which are pending or
threatened of which the Issuer is aware) during the 12 months before the date of this document which
may have or have had in the recent past a significant effect on the financial position or profitability of
the Issuer or the Group.

characteristics, these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposure to adverse conditions.
An obligation rated "BB" is less vulnerable to non-payment than other speculative issues. However, it
faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions
that could lead to the obligor's inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitments on the obligation.
In accordance with such S&P ratings definitions, a short-term rating of "B" indicates that an obligation
is vulnerable and has significant speculative characteristics. It indicated that the obligor currently has
the capacity to meet its financial commitments; however, it faces major ongoing uncertainties that could
lead to the obligor's inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitments. In accordance with Fitch's
ratings definitions available as at the date of this Offering Circular on

vulnerability to default risk, particularly in the event of adverse changes in business or economic
conditions over time; however, business or financial flexibility exists that supports the servicing of
financial commitments. In accordance with such Fitch ratings definitions, a short-term rating of "B"
indicates an uncertain capacity for timely payment of financial commitments relative to other issuers or
obligations in the same country or monetary union. In accordance with DBRS's ratings definitions

definitions, a short-term rating of "R-2" indicates the capacity for the payment of short-term financial
obligations as they fall due is acceptable. The obligor may be vulnerable to future events.

**Dealers transacting with the Issuer**

Certain of the Dealers and their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in financing, in
investment banking and/or commercial banking transactions with, and may perform services for, the
Issuer and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business. They have received, or may in the future
receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions. Certain of the Dealers and their
affiliates may have positions, deal or make markets in the Notes issued under the Programme, related
derivatives and reference obligations, including (but not limited to) entering into hedging strategies on
behalf of the Issuer or its affiliates, investor clients, or as principal in order to manage their exposure,
their general market risk, or other trading activities. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business
activities, the Dealers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively
trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including
bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and
securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or its affiliates. Certain of
the Dealers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Issuer routinely hedge their credit
exposure to the Issuer in a way consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically,
such Dealers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist
of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities, including
potentially the Notes issued under the Programme. Any such positions could adversely affect future
trading prices of Notes issued under the Programme. The Dealers and their affiliates may also make
investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such
securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or
short positions in such securities and instruments. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term
"affiliates" includes parent companies.
