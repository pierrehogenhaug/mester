# Unicaja Banco, S.A.

_(incorporated as a limited liability company (sociedad anónima) under the laws of Spain)_

## EUR 300,000,000

 Fixed Rate Reset Subordinated Notes due 2032

The issue price of the €300,000,000 Fixed Rate Reset Subordinated Notes due 2032 (the “Notes”) of Unicaja Banco, S.A. (the “Issuer”,
the “Bank” or “Unicaja Banco”) is 99.714% of their principal amount. The Notes have been issued in denominations of €100,000. The
Notes were issued on 19 January 2022 (the “Issue Date”). The Bank and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to herein as the
“Group”.

As described in the terms and conditions of the Notes (the “Conditions”), unless previously redeemed, the Notes will be redeemed at
their principal amount on 19 July 2032. The Notes may be redeemed at the option of the Bank in whole, but not in part at their principal
amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to (but excluding) the date fixed for redemption, subject to the conditions
set out in Condition 4.2 including, without limitation, obtaining prior Supervisory Permission, if a Tax Event, a Capital Event or a MREL
Disqualification Event occurs (as such terms are defined in the Conditions). See Conditions 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6 in “Conditions of the Notes”.
In particular, the Notes may be redeemed pursuant to a MREL Disqualification Event only after five years from the Issue Date.

In addition, the Bank may at its option, subject to the conditions set out in Condition 4.2 including, without limitation, obtaining prior
Supervisory Permission, redeem all, but not some only, of the Notes on any day falling in the period commencing on (and including) 19
January 2027 and ending on (and including) the Reset Date at their principal amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest
thereon to (but excluding) the date fixed for redemption. See Condition 4.3 in “Conditions of the Notes”.

The Notes bear interest on their outstanding principal amount (i) at a fixed rate of 3.125% per annum from (and including) the Issue Date
to (but excluding) the Reset Date (as defined in the Conditions) payable annually (except for the first Interest Period (as defined in the
Conditions)) in arrear on 19 July in each year, with the first Interest Payment Date on 19 July 2022 (short coupon), and (ii) from (and
including) the Reset Date (as defined in the Conditions), at the Reset Rate of Interest (the sum of the 5-year Mid Swap Rate (as defined
in the Conditions) plus 3.050% per annum (the “Margin”)), as determined by the Bank, payable annually in arrear on 19 July in each
year, with the first Interest Payment Date after the Reset Date on 19 July 2028 (see Condition 3 in “Conditions of the Notes”). Payments
on the Notes will be made in Euro without deduction for or on account of taxes imposed or levied by the Kingdom of Spain to the extent
described under Condition 7 in “Conditions of the Notes”.

The payment obligations of the Bank under the Notes constitute direct, unconditional, unsecured and subordinated obligations (“créditos
_subordinados”) of the Bank, as more fully described in Condition 2. The Bank will request that the Notes qualify as Tier 2 Capital (as_
defined in the Conditions) of the Bank and of the Group for the purposes of the Applicable Banking Regulations. The Notes are expected
to be eligible for MREL (as defined in “Risk Factors - Increasingly onerous capital, liquidity and funding requirements constitute one of
_the Group’s main regulatory challenges”)._

Subject to the prior Supervisory Permission (and/or otherwise in accordance with the Applicable Banking Regulations then in force), if
a Tax Event, a Capital Event or a MREL Disqualification Event has occurred and is continuing, the Bank may substitute all (but not some
only) of the Notes or vary the terms of all (but not some only) of the Notes, without the consent of the Holders (as defined below), so that
they become or remain Qualifying Tier 2 Notes (as defined in the Conditions).

The final rating provided by Fitch Ratings Ireland Limited (“Fitch”) to the Notes is BB. Fitch is established in the European Union
(“EU”) and is registered under Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 (as amended) on credit rating agencies (the “CRA Regulation”). Fitch
appears on the latest update of the list of registered credit rating agencies (as of 7 May 2021) on the European Securities and Markets

Kingdom and registered under Regulation (EU) No 1060/2009 as it forms part of domestic law of the United Kingdom by virtue of the
European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “UK CRA Regulation”). Fitch has been certified under the UK CRA Regulation.

This document (together with the information incorporated by reference) constitutes a listing prospectus (the “Prospectus”) for the
purposes of Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 (the “Prospectus
**Regulation”) and has been prepared in accordance with, and including the information required by Annexes 7 and 15 of Delegated**
Regulation (EU) 2019/980 of 14 March 2019. This Prospectus has been approved by the Spanish National Securities Market Commission
(Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores) (the “CNMV”) as competent authority under the Prospectus Regulation and is available at
the website of the Issuer (https://www.unicajabanco.com/es/inversores-y-accionistas/emisiones/programas-de-emision) and at the
website of the CNMV (www.cnmv.es). For the avoidance of doubt, unless specifically incorporated by reference into this Prospectus,
information contained on any website referred to in this Prospectus does not form part of this Prospectus and has not been scrutinised or
approved by the CNMV. The CNMV has only approved this Prospectus as meeting the standards of completeness, comprehensibility and
consistency imposed by the Prospectus Regulation. Such an approval should not be considered as an endorsement of the Bank or the
quality of the Notes that are the subject of this Prospectus. Investors should make their own assessment as to the suitability of investing
in the Notes.

Application has been made for the Notes to be admitted to trading on the Spanish AIAF Fixed Income Securities Market (“AIAF”). AIAF
is a regulated market for the purposes of Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments directive (as amended, “MiFID II”).

Amounts payable under the Notes from and including the Reset Date are calculated by reference to the 5-year Mid-Swap Rate which (i)
appears on the “ICESWAP2” page under the heading “EURIBOR BASIS – EUR” and above the caption “11AM FRANKFURT” as of
11.00 am (CET) on the Reset Determination Date, which is provided by ICE Benchmark Administration Limited or (ii), only if the 5year Mid-Swap Rate does not appear on such page and at such time on the Reset Determination Date, is calculated by reference to
EURIBOR 6-month (as defined in the Conditions) which appears on the “EURIBOR01” page, which is provided by the European Money
Markets Institute. As at the date of this Prospectus, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited does not appear on the register of
administrators and benchmarks established and maintained by ESMA pursuant to Article 36 of Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2016 (as amended, the “Benchmark Regulation”). As far Unicaja Banco is aware,
the transitional provisions in Article 51 of the Benchmark Regulation apply, such that ICE Benchmark Administration Limited is not
currently required to obtain authorisation or registration (or, if located outside the European Union, recognition, endorsement or
equivalence). As at the date of this Prospectus, the European Money Markets Institute appears on the register of administrators and
benchmarks established and maintained by ESMA pursuant to article 36 of the Benchmark Regulation.

Title to the Notes is evidenced by book entries, and each person shown in the central registry of the Spanish clearance and settlement
system managed by Sociedad de Gestión de los Sistemas de Registro, Compensación y Liquidación de Valores, S.A. Unipersonal
(“Iberclear”) and in the registries maintained by the participating entities (entidades participantes) in Iberclear (“Iberclear Members”)

the Notes recorded therein (a “Holder”).

**The Notes are complex financial instruments and are not a suitable or appropriate investment for all investors.**

**Prospective purchasers of the Notes should ensure that they understand the nature of the Notes and the extent of their exposure**
**to risks and that they consider the suitability of the Notes as an investment in the light of their own circumstances and financial**

-----

In this Prospectus, unless otherwise specified, references to a “Member State” are references to a Member
State of the EEA, references to “EUR” or “euro” are to the currency introduced at the start of the third stage of
European economic and monetary union, and as defined in Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 of
3 May 1998 on the introduction of the euro, as amended. References to “billions” are to thousands of millions.

Certain figures included in this Prospectus have been subject to rounding adjustments; accordingly, figures
shown for the same category presented in different tables may vary slightly and figures shown as totals in certain
tables may not be an arithmetic aggregation of the figures which precede them.

Words and expressions defined in the Conditions (see “Conditions of the Notes”) shall have the same meanings
when used elsewhere in this Prospectus unless otherwise specified.

This Prospectus includes forward-looking statements that reflect the Issuer's intentions, beliefs or current
expectations and projections about its future results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, performance,
prospects, anticipated growth, strategies, plans, opportunities, trends and the market in which it operates. These
forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding the Bank's present and future
business and the environment in which it expects to operate in the future and have not been verified by an
independent entity; the accuracy, completeness or correctness thereof should not be relied upon. The forwardlooking events described in this Prospectus may not occur. These forward-looking statements speak only as at
the date on which they are made. Except as otherwise required by applicable securities law and regulations and
by any applicable stock exchange regulations, the Bank undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise
publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed
circumstances or any other reason after the date of this Prospectus. Given the uncertainty inherent in forwardlooking statements, the Bank cautions prospective investors not to place undue reliance on these statements.

Potential investors are advised to exercise caution in relation to any purchase of the Notes. If a potential investor
is in any doubt about any of the contents of this Prospectus, it should obtain independent professional advice.
Prior to making an investment decision, potential investors should consider carefully, in light of their own
financial circumstances and investment objectives, all the information contained in this Prospectus or
incorporated by reference herein.

The Notes are complex financial instruments and are not a suitable or appropriate investment for all investors.
Each potential investor in the Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own
circumstances. In particular, each potential investor may wish to consider, either on its own or with the help of
its financial and other professional advisers, whether it:

(i) has sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Notes, the merits and
risks of investing in the Notes and the information contained or incorporated by reference in this
Prospectus, taking into account that the Notes are a suitable investment for professional or institutional
investors only;

(ii) has access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its particular
financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact the Notes will have on its overall
investment portfolio;

(iii) has sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the Notes,
including where the currency for payments in respect of the Notes is different from the potential
investor’s currency;

(iv) understands thoroughly the terms of the Notes, including the provisions relating to redemption or
substitution of the Notes and any variation of their terms, and is familiar with the behaviour of financial
markets; and

A46786082

5


-----

(v) is able to evaluate possible scenarios for economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its
investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks.

A potential investor should not invest in the Notes unless it has the expertise (either alone or with its financial
and other professional advisers) to evaluate how the Notes will perform under changing conditions, the resulting
effects on the value of the Notes and the impact this investment will have on the potential investor’s overall
portfolio.

The Notes are rated BB by Fitch. Similar ratings assigned to different types of securities do not necessarily
mean the same thing and any rating assigned to the Notes does not address the likelihood that interest (including
any additional amounts payable in accordance with Condition 7) or any other payments in respect of the Notes
will be made on any particular date or at all. Credit ratings also do not address the marketability or market price
of securities.

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension
or withdrawal, at any time, by the assigning rating organisation. Potential investors should not rely on any rating
of the Notes and should make their investment decision in light of its own circumstances. The Bank does not
participate in any decision making of the rating agencies and any revision or withdrawal of any credit rating
assigned to the Bank or any securities of the Bank is a third party decision for which the Bank does not assume
any responsibility.

**PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS – The Notes are not intended to be offered,**
sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail
investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail
client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive
(EU) 2016/97 (the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no key information
document (KID) required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 on key information documents for packaged and
retail and insurance-based investment products (the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or
selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under
the PRIIPs Regulation.

**PROHIBITION OF SALES TO UK RETAIL INVESTORS – The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold**
or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor
in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as
defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of
European Union (Withdrawal) Act of 2018 (“EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions
of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the
FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of
UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (“UK MiFIR”). Consequently no key information document (KID)
required by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs
**Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK**
has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail
investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

**MIFID II PRODUCT GOVERNANCE / PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS AND ECP ONLY TARGET**
**MARKET – Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market**
assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution

A46786082

-----

of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. The target market assessment
indicates that the Notes are incompatible with the needs, characteristic and objectives of clients which have no
risk tolerance or are seeking on-demand full repayment of the amounts invested. Any person subsequently
offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’
target market assessment. However, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own
target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Singapore Securities and Futures Act Product Classification**   - Solely for the purposes of its obligations
pursuant to sections 309B(1)(a) and 309B(1)(c) of the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289) of Singapore
(the “SFA”), the Bank has determined, and hereby notifies all relevant persons (as defined in Section 309A(1)
of the SFA), that the Notes are ‘prescribed capital markets products' (as defined in the Securities and Futures
(Capital Markets Products) Regulations 2018) and Excluded Investment Products (as defined in MAS Notice
SFA 04-N12: Notice on the Sale of Investment Products and MAS Notice FAA-N16: Notice on
Recommendations on Investment Products).

**INFORMATION ON THE MERGER WITH LIBERBANK**

The merger of Liberbank, S.A. (“Liberbank”) (absorbed company) into Unicaja (absorbing company) became
effective on 30 July 2021 (the “Merger”). Please see “Description of the Issuer – History and Development –
_Recent developments – Merger by absorption of Liberbank by Unicaja Banco”_ for more information.

Although descriptions contained in this Prospectus are those of Unicaja Banco and its Group after the Merger,
quantitative information for the 2020 and 2019 fiscal years in this Prospectus (including historical consolidated
financial information and information on the regulatory own funds and eligible liabilities position for such
periods) refers to Unicaja Banco and/or Liberbank (and their respective groups) as separate entities and/or
groups and, therefore, that information may not reflect what the business, financial condition, results of
operations, cash flows or regulatory own funds and eligible liabilities position and requirements of the Group
resulting from the Merger would have been had the Merger been effective during those periods.

The financial information on the Group resulting from the Merger is limited to the Group’s unaudited financial
report as of and for the nine-months ended 30 September 2021. Given that the Merger was materialised on 31
July 2021 for accounting purposes (i) the financial information of the Bank and/or the Group as of 31 December
2020 does not contain any financial information regarding Liberbank; (ii) the consolidated balance sheet of the
Group as of 30 September 2021 includes Liberbank’s assets and liabilities and the results generated by
Liberbank in August and September 2021 and therefore it is not comparable with the consolidated balance sheet
of the Group as of 31 December 2020; and (iii) the consolidated income statement of the Group for the nine
months ended 30 September 2021 includes the results generated by Liberbank in August and September 2021
and therefore it is not comparable with the consolidated income statement of the Group for the nine months
period ended 30 September 2020. In addition, no information on the regulatory capital requirements and on the
own funds and eligible liabilities requirements (MREL requirement) for the Group resulting from the Merger
is available.

Consequently, it may be difficult to evaluate the current business of Unicaja Banco and its Group and predict
its future performance on the basis of the information contained in this Prospectus.

_Central Bank and Bank of Spain) and that may have an impact on the financial statements and risks described_
_hereinafter._

_Any investment in the Notes is subject to a number of risks. Prior to investing in the Notes, prospective investors_
_should carefully consider risk factors associated with any investment in the Notes, the business of the Issuer_
_(and the Group) and the industry in which it operates together with all other information contained in this_
_Prospectus, including, in particular the risk factors described below._

_Only risks which are specific and material to the Issuer and to the Notes are included herein as required by the_
_Prospectus Regulation. Additional risks and uncertainties relating to the Issuer or the Group that are not_

_decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment. Investors should consider carefully whether an_
_investment in the Notes is suitable for them in light of the information in this Prospectus and their personal_
_circumstances. Risks that apply generally to securities with the characteristics of the Notes (for instance, risks_
_related to modifications of the Notes approved by a meeting of Holders of the Notes, risks related to the absence_
_of limitations on the amount or type of further securities or indebtedness which the Bank may incur or risks_

### RISKS RELATING TO THE ISSUER AND THE GROUP

 Business and financial risks

 The Group’s business is significantly affected by the credit risk of its customers and counterparties and is particularly exposed to the creditworthiness of individuals, families and small and medium enterprises (“SMEs”).

The Group is exposed to the creditworthiness of its customers and counterparties. Credit risk is defined as
potential losses in respect of the full or partial breach of the debt repayment obligations of customers or
counterparties (including, but not limited to, the insolvency of a counterparty or debtor), and also includes the
value loss as a consequence of the credit quality of customers or counterparties. This risk is particularly

A46786082

14


-----

significant in adverse market situations such as those prevailing today, principally due to the COVID-19
pandemic.

As of 30 September 2021, credits to customers and fixed income debt securities[1] represented 50.7% and 23.6%
respectively, of the total assets of the Group (42.2% and 35.6%, respectively, as of 31 December 2020).
Although in some cases compliance with the referred contractual obligations is secured, collateral and security
provided to the Group may be insufficient.

In addition, the Group’s loan portfolio primarily consists of mortgage and consumer lending granted to retail
customers[2] (representing 63.5% and 64.2% of the total performing loan book as of 30 September 2021 and 31
December 2020, respectively) and loans to SMEs (representing 13.2% and 13.5% of the total performing loan
book as of 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2020, respectively, and including the self-employed).
Households and SMEs with a high level of debt are more likely to have difficulties in complying with their debt
obligations due to unfavorable economic circumstances than other types of clients; therefore, the high
concentration in this type of clients could have a negative impact on the income from interest of the Group.
Furthermore, the high level of debt of households and SMEs also limits their capacity to incur any further debt,
which could negatively affect the Group’s business activities.

In general, the Group’s ability to mitigate credit risk depends in large part on its ability to assess the credit
worthiness of its counterparties. However, the availability of precise, complete financial information as well as
general credit information on which to base decisions related to credit is more limited with regard to SMEs than
it is for large corporates and is even more limited in the case of households and may lead to errors on the precise
assessment of the credit risk.

Non-performing or low credit quality loans could negatively impact the Group’s results of operations. As of 30
September 2021, the non-performing loans (“NPLs”) amounted to €1,862 million (€1,181 million as of 31
December 2020), the Group’s NPL ratio[3] was 3.4% (4.2% as of 31 December 2020) and the Group’s NPL
coverage ratio[4] was 72.1% (67.4% as of 31 December 2020). In addition, the Group had €1,452[5] million of
refinanced and restructured gross loans (of which 54.3% corresponded to NPLs) as of 30 September 2021
(€1,223 million (of which 52.8% corresponded to NPLs) as of 31 December 2020).

With regard to Liberbank, as of 31 December 2020, the NPLs amounted to €805 million, its NPL ratio was
2.9% and its NPL coverage ratio was 56.1%. In addition, Liberbank had €367.8 million of refinanced and
restructured gross loans[6] (of which 70% corresponded to NPLs) as of 31 December 2020.

If the Group was unable to control the level of its non-performing or poor credit quality loans, this could
adversely affect the Group’s financial condition and results of operations since the assets do not generate income
but drain resources related to the recovery process in addition to the explicit costs that might be materialized
through the constitution of provisions and other impairments.

### The Group is subject to significant exposure to real estate

The Group is exposed to the Spanish real estate market both directly (through the real estate assets that it owns)
and indirectly (given that real estate assets secure many of its outstanding loans).

As of 30 September 2021, the gross carrying amount of foreclosed real estate assets amounted to €2,323 million,
which in net terms (€881 million) represented 0.81% of total assets (€1,091 million as of 31 December 2020,
which in net terms (€405 million) represented 0.6% of total assets) and the foreclosed assets coverage ratio [7]
stood at 62.1% (62.9% as of 31 December 2020). Additionally, as of 30 June 2021, the gross loans to real estate
developers amounted to €735.1[8] million, which in net terms (€693.8[9] million) represented 1.05% of total assets
(€816.8 million as of 31 December 2020, which in net terms (€770.2 million) represented 1.2% of total assets).
As of 30 June 2021, the carrying amount of mortgage loans granted to its customers for households to buy
housing totaled to €14,767.3[10] million, which represented 22.3% of total assets (€14,773.1 million as of 31
December 2020, which represented 22.5% of total assets).

With regard to Liberbank, as of 31 December 2020, the gross carrying amount of foreclosed real estate assets
amounted to €1,333.6 million, which in net terms (€672.8 million) represented 1.4% of Liberbank’s total assets
and the foreclosed assets coverage ratio stood at 49.5%. Additionally, as of 30 June 2021, the gross loans to real
estate developers amounted to €342.3[11] million, which in net terms (€311.5 million) represented 0.7% of
Liberbank’s total assets (€336.9 million as of 31 December 2020, which in net terms (€312.4 million)
represented 0.7% of total assets). As of 30 June 2021, the carrying amount of mortgage loans granted to its
customers for households to buy housing totaled to €15,873.7 [12] million, which represented 34.2% of
Liberbank’s total assets (€15,088.1 million as of 31 December 2020, which represented 31.8% of total assets).

While in recent years the demand for housing and related real estate loans has increased again, it is expected
that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a material negative impact on the property market. Any decreases in
property prices in Spain would reduce the value of the portfolio of real-estate assets owned by the Group and
underlying collateral securing its mortgage loans and other property loans. In the event of defaults, this would
therefore increase the expected losses of the Group. All of the aforementioned could materially and negatively
affect the Group’s banking, capital and funding activities and have a material adverse effect on its business,
prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

### The Group faces risks relating to disruptions, dislocations, structural challenges and volatility in financial markets and is exposed to counterparty risk with the Spanish and foreign governments

The business of the Group is exposed to market risk, which concerns the potential losses deriving from a change
in value of the positions in the portfolios of assets held for trading and available for sale because of adverse
fluctuations in or volatility of market prices. These changes would sometimes be defined by the primary factors

thereof, such as credit and interest-rate risks for the price of fixed-income instruments. In the case of options,
there are several risk factors to be taken into consideration with volatility being a key one.

In particular, the business of the Group will be exposed to the risk of fluctuations in market price; the fair value
of equities could therefore fall as a result of changes in share prices or indexes. Price risk affects positions
classified as financial assets and liabilities held for trading, non-trading financial assets mandatorily at fair value
through profit or loss, financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss and financial assets at fair
value through other comprehensive income. A 1% decrease in the market price would lead to a total impact on
the Group’s equity of €1.9 million as of 31 December 2020 (net of the corresponding tax effect).

Financial markets (in particular equity, debt and oil and other commodities markets) can experience sometimes
sustained periods of unpredictable movements, severe dislocations, liquidity disruptions and economic shocks,
some or all of which may not be linked to changes in the broader economic situation. The Group’s wholesale
funds (markets)[13] amounted to €10,171 million, or 9.3% of the Group’s total assets as of 30 September 2021
(€7,121 million or 10.8% of the Group’s total assets as of 31 December 2020). With regard to Liberbank, the
wholesale funds (markets) amounted to €3,988.1 million, or 8.4% of Liberbank’s total assets as of 31 December
2020. Any unpredictable or extreme market conditions could lead to volatility in the Group’s profitability and
solvency and in the carrying amount of certain assets in the Group’s balance sheet, caused by price changes and
changes in the demand for some of the Group’s banking services and products. This could result in, among
other things, a delay in raising funding or capital, the issuance of capital and funding of different types or under
different terms than otherwise would have been issued or realized, or the incurrence of additional or increased
funding and capital costs compared to the costs borne in a more stable market environment. Furthermore, the
Group’s hedging and other risk management strategies, such as balance sheet steering and interest rate
management, may not be as effective at mitigating risks as such strategies would be under more stable market
conditions.

Financial markets are susceptible to severe events characterized by rapid depreciation in asset values
accompanied by a reduction in liquidity. Under such conditions, market participants are particularly exposed to
the market behavior of other market participants simultaneously unwinding or adjusting positions, which may
even further exacerbate rapid decreases in values of some of the Group’s assets or collateral held in the Group’s
favor and which could cause liquidity tensions and disruptions.

There can be no assurance that market volatility will not result in a prolonged market decline, or that market
declines for other reasons will not occur in the future. Market decline could lead to the Group suffering
significant losses, especially if the slump were to persist for an extended period of time. Therefore, market
volatility, liquidity disruptions, or market dislocations could materially and adversely affect the Group’s
banking, capital and funding activities and could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s liquidity,
business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Any decline in the credit ratings of the states issuing the debt securities acquired by the Group could adversely
affect the value of the respective securities held by Unicaja Banco in its various portfolios. Any decline in the
credit ratings of Spanish public debt would also likely increase the cost of financing this public debt, which
could result in increased taxation or lower government spending and, consequently, could have an adverse effect
on Spanish economic conditions and lead to an increase in sovereign default risk. As of 30 September 2021, the
exposure of the Group to sovereign risk[14] amounted to €22,889[15] million, representing 21% of the total assets

corresponding metric as of 31 December 2020 included in Note 27 of the 2020 Consolidated Annual Accounts for its inclusion in this
Prospectus for comparison purposes.

(€18,908.2 million, representing 28.8% of the total assets, as of 31 December 2020), where Spanish sovereign
exposure represented 61.8% of that exposure (55% as of 31 December 2020), Italian sovereign exposure
represented 34.7% (43% as of 31 December 2020) and Portuguese sovereign exposure represented 1.1% (1.6%
as of 31 December 2020), while the remaining 2.4% of sovereign exposure corresponded to Andorra and the
United States (0.4% as of 31 December 2020). With regard to Liberbank, as of 31 December 2020, its sovereign
risk amounted to €14,589.1[16] million, representing 30.7% of its total assets, where Spanish sovereign exposure
represented 76.1% of that exposure, Italian sovereign exposure represented 22.2% and Portuguese sovereign
exposure represented 1.7%.

A downgrade of the Group’s public debt portfolio could also adversely affect the extent to which it can use
these securities as collateral for European Central Bank (“ECB”) refinancing and, indirectly, for refinancing
with other securities.

Consequently, if any of the governments and related public entities to which the Group has exposure fails to
comply with its obligations under debt or other obligations or suffer any credit rating downgrade or significant
increase in the yield on its debt, this could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, prospects
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

### A downgrading of Unicaja Banco’s credit rating could have a negative effect on Unicaja Banco’s activities, financial condition and results of operations

Unicaja Banco has been assigned the following ratings by credit rating agencies:

**Agency** **Long term** **Short term** **Outlook**

Fitch (3 December 2021) BBB- F3 Stable

Moody’s (25 May 2021) Baa3 Prime-3 Stable

Any downgrading of Unicaja Banco’s credit rating could drive up the costs of funding or require the Group to
replace funding lost due to the downgrading or possible downgrading of its rating; restrict Unicaja Banco’s
access to capital markets and certain types of instrument and money and financial markets; require additional
collateral to be provided to secure derivative contracts and other secure funding agreements; adversely affect
the sale or commercialization of products; reduce the pool of possible investors in Unicaja Banco; hinder its
ability to retain customers; and affect Unicaja Banco’s involvement in commercial transactions. Any of these
factors could erode the Group’s liquidity and negatively affect its activities, financial condition and results.

Given the difficulties faced by the financial markets and financial services sector, it cannot be guaranteed that
the ratings agencies will not change their ratings or outlook for Unicaja Banco.

### The Group’s business is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates

The Group’s business is inherently subject to interest rate risk and any failure to manage changes in interest rate
levels, yield curves and spreads may affect its business due to (i) the reduction of the spread between the average
yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, (ii) the repricing value of the
assets and liabilities of the Group and (iii) lower profitability. The results of the Group’s banking operations are
affected by the management of interest rate risk, by which the Group manages the relationship between changes
in market interest rates on the Group’s assets and liabilities and changes in the Group current and future cash
flows and net interest income as a result therefrom.

16 As compared to Unicaja’s sovereign risk, this amount includes sovereign risk (i) held through financial derivatives and (ii) guaranteed by the

ECB

A rise or decline in interest rates would cause a progressive repricing of the Group’s variable rate assets[17]
(€70,753 million have floating or variable rates, or will reprice immediately, as of 30 September 2021,
representing 65% of the Group’s total assets, and €36,049 million as of 31 December 2020, representing 55%
of the Group’s total assets) and liabilities[18] (€65,389 million have floating or variable rates, or will reprice
immediately, as of 30 September 2021, representing 60% of the Group’s total assets, and €30,806 million as of
31 December 2020, representing 47% of the Group’s total assets). In Liberbank variable rate assets, or assets
that will reprice immediately, amounted to €20,171 million as of 31 December 2020, representing 42.5% of
Liberbank’s total assets, and variable rate liabilities, or liabilities that will reprice immediately, amounted to
€10,949.4 million as of 31 December 2020, representing 23% of Liberbank’s total assets.

In this regard, as of 31 December 2020, and under the assumptions of constant balance and following the
modelling of non-maturity deposits recommended by the European Banking Authority (“EBA”), the Group
estimates that a parallel and instantaneous increase of 10 basis points in interest rate curves would have had a
positive impact of 2.1% on the Group’s net interest income once the balance sheet is fully repriced. Conversely,
the scenario of a parallel and instantaneous decrease of 10 basis points in interest rate curves would have had a
negative impact of 2.0% on the Group’s net interest income once the balance sheet is fully repriced (which
would happen in the second financial year). With regard to Liberbank, as of 31 December 2020, a parallel and
instantaneous increase of 10 basis points in interest rate curves would have had a negative impact of around
0.2% on its net interest income once the balance sheet is fully repriced and a parallel decrease of 10 basis points
in interest rates curves would have had a positive impact of around 0.1% on its net interest income once the
balance sheet is fully repriced.

If the yield on the Group’s interest-earning assets does not increase at the same time or to the same extent as
the Group’s cost of funds, or if the Group’s cost of funds does not decline at the same time or to the same extent
as the decrease in yield on the Group’s interest-earning assets, the Group’s market value, current and future
cash flows and net interest income may be materially and adversely affected. Even though changes in absolute
interest rate levels are difficult to predict and are influenced by numerous factors beyond the Group’s control
(i.e., the financial sector regulation in the markets in which the Group operates, the monetary policies developed
by the ECB and other central banks and the Spanish and international political and economic climate), if the
current period of flatter and negative interest rate yield curves persists it could have a material adverse effect
on the Group’s net interest income given the current low yields of the Group’s loan and its debt securities
portfolios.

In addition, changes in the yield of the Group’s assets might not be mirrored by changes in the cost of the
Group’s liabilities. The Group’s loan book is mostly linked to the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”)
while the Group’s retail term deposit base cost is not and therefore further falls in EURIBOR might not be offset
by a similar fall in the cost of retail term deposits, which would negatively impact the Group’s net interest
income.

A low interest rate environment, such as that experienced as of the date of this Prospectus, puts pressure on the
Group’s margins, and a continued low rates environment could materially and adversely affect the Group’s
business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Although the Group seeks to
manage its banking book with interest rate risk hedging instruments or by promoting different financial products
and strategies, mismatches in funding costs and interest income may have a material adverse effect on the
Group’s business.

_Performance Measures”._

On the other hand, a stronger than expected rise in interest rates could be very damaging to the Group’s business
through an increase in loan impairment charges as well as by significantly increasing defaults on customers’
loans if borrowers cannot refinance in a higher interest rate environment or if they are unable to meet their
greater interest expense obligations.

### Funding and liquidity risks are inherent in the Group’s operations

Liquidity risk entails uncertainties relating to the Group’s ability, under adverse conditions, to access funding
necessary to cover its obligations to customers, meet its liabilities as they come due or at bearable cost for the
Bank and satisfy capital requirements. It includes the risk of mismanagement of the Group’s liquidity position
which can negatively result in unexpected increases in the cost of funding, the risk of misaligned maturities
between assets and liabilities, as well as the risk of inability to meet the Group’s payment obligations on time
at a reasonable price due to liquidity pressures. The Group is subject to the risk that it cannot meet the Group’s
payments and collateral obligations when due without significant losses or at all. The Group is also subject to
the risk of not being able to meet expected or unexpected current or future cash outflows or collateral needs
without affecting either daily operations or the Group’s financial condition.

As of 30 September 2021, the Group’s financing structure in terms of total liabilities and equity consists of
58.7% of retail funding[19] (€64,085 million) (58.1% or €38,062 million as of 31 December 2020), 8.4% of
deposits of public administrations (€9,198 million) (5% or €3,265 million as of 31 December 2020), 9.3% of
wholesale funds (markets) (€10,171 million) (10.9% or €7,121 million as of 31 December 2020), 9.5% of
central banks funding (€10,318 million) (7.6% or €4,998 million as of 31 December 2020), 3.5% of deposits
and repos from credit institutions (€3,864 million) (5.8% or €3,805 million as of 31 December 2020), 5.0% of
other liabilities[20] (€5,493 million) (6.5% or €4,287 million as of 31 December 2020) and 5.5% of equity (€6,013
million) (6.1% or €4,005 million as of 31 December 2020).

As of 31 December 2020, Liberbank’s financing structure consisted of 51.5% of retail deposits[21] (€24,486.5
million), 4.9% of deposits of public administrations (€2,309.8 million), 8.4% of wholesale funds (markets)[22]
(€3,988.1 million), 9.4% of central banks funding (€4,464.3 million), 13.8% of deposits and repos from credit
institutions [23] (€6,532.7 million), 5% of other liabilities [24] (€2,375.8 million) and 7.1% of equity (€3,352.8
million).

With regard to funding risk, the Group relies on customer deposits from retail, private and corporate banking
customers to meet the majority of its funding needs. As of 30 September 2021, the total amount of customer
deposits (non-market) excluding valuation adjustments[25] amounted to €73,283 million, or 67.1% of the Group’s
total assets as of such date (€41,327 million or 63% of the Group’s total assets as of 31 December 2020). In the
case of Liberbank, the total amount of customer deposits (non-market) excluding valuation adjustments
amounted to €27,309.3 million, or 57.5% of its total assets as of 31 December 2020. Such deposits may be
subject to fluctuation as a result of several factors, some of which are outside the Group’s control. The shortterm nature of part of this source of financing could cause liquidity problems in the future if deposits do not

reach the expected volumes or are not renewed. If a significant number of depositors withdraw their deposits
or do not reinvest after their termination, the Group’s liquidity could suffer.

Wholesale funds (markets) amounted to €10,171 million, or 9.3% of the Group’s total assets as of 30 September
2021 (€7,121 million or 10.9% of the Group’s total assets, and €3,988.1 million or 8.4% of Liberbank’s total
assets as of 31 December 2020). In the event that wholesale markets funding were to be no longer available or
too expensive, or if the ECB decides to normalize monetary policy, the Group could be forced to raise interest
rates paid on deposits to attract more customers and/or sell assets, possibly at reduced prices. The persistence
or worsening of adverse market conditions or the rising of interest rates could have a material adverse effect on
the Group’s ability to access liquidity and negatively impact upon its financing costs (either directly or
indirectly). In this regard, the Group’s financing capacity depends largely on the credit rating of Spain, which
acts as a “roof” on the credit rating of Spanish companies. A potential downgrade in the credit rating of Spain
could negatively affect the way financial institutions (including the Group) fund their balance sheets, increasing
their effective cost and worsening their financial results. Furthermore, any downgrade in the credit rating of
Spain may increase the risk of a downgrade of the Group’s credit ratings by the rating agencies.

In addition, most of the Group’s long-term funding has been formalized through mortgage covered bonds, and
the Group maintains a relevant covered bonds issuance legal capacity. As of 30 September 2021, the outstanding
amount of mortgage covered bonds was €4,934.1[26] million (€3,433.9 million as of 31 December 2020) and the
Group had an issuance legal capacity of €14,992.1 million (€8,644.6 million as of 31 December 2020)
(calculated in accordance with applicable regulations which, as of 30 September 2021, was Law 2/1981,
regulating the mortgage market (Ley 2/1981 de regulación del mercado hipotecario)). Moreover, as of 30
September 2021, the total outstanding amount of mortgage covered bonds that are expected to mature before
31 December 2022 amounted to €462 million, representing 9.4% of the total outstanding amount of mortgage
covered bonds. In relation to Liberbank, as of 31 December 2020, the outstanding amount of mortgage covered
bonds was €7,093 million and Liberbank had an issuance capacity of €4,683.1 million. A potential reduction of
the portfolio eligible to be used to cover bonds due to the outcome of future internal reviews or changes to the
Spanish or EU covered bonds regulation could potentially reduce the Group’s eligible portfolio and covered
bond issuance capacity, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, prospects financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Although as of 30 September 2021, the Group’s LTD ratio[27] was 75% (65.2% as of 31 December 2020) and the
Group’s liquidity coverage (“LCR”) and net stable funding (“NSFR”) ratios were in excess of regulatory
requirements (300% and 140% as of 30 September 2021, respectively, and 310% and 142% as of 31 December
2020, respectively), there can be no assurance that this will be the case in the future. With regards to Liberbank,
its LTD ratio was 100.8%, while its LCR and NSFR ratios were 222.2% and 118.4%, respectively, as of 31
December 2020.

In light of all of the aforesaid, in the present economic climate and given the uncertain economic and social
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group is unable to provide assurance that Unicaja Banco can meet its
liquidity requirements or fulfil them without incurring higher funding costs, which could have a substantial
adverse impact on its business, results and/or financial and equity position.

26 This metric has been obtained from the Bank’s accounting records as of 30 September 2021, and is determined in the same manner as the

corresponding metric as of 31 December 2020 included in Note 17.3 of the 2020 Consolidated Annual Accounts for its inclusion in this
Prospectus for comparison purposes.

### Increased competition in the markets where the Group operates may adversely affect its growth prospects and operations

The markets in which the Group operates are highly competitive. Financial sector reforms in these markets
(mainly in Spain) have increased competition among both local and foreign financial institutions, and the Bank
believes that this trend will continue in the future. In addition, the trend towards consolidation in the banking
sector has created larger and stronger banks with which the Group must now compete.

The Group also faces competition from non-bank competitors, such as brokerage companies, department stores
(for some credit products), leasing and factoring companies, mutual fund and pension fund management
companies and insurance companies, “crowdfunding” and other financial technology developments, financial
services technologies (Fintechs) which include “payment initiation services providers” and “information
services providers”, internet-based e-commerce providers, mobile telephone companies and internet search
engines and other large digital players such as Amazon, Google, Facebook or Apple, who have also started to
offer financial services (mainly payments and credit) ancillary to their core business. Several of these
competitors may have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition and significant
financial, marketing and other resources. They may adopt more aggressive pricing and rates and devote more
resources to technology, infrastructure and marketing. Additionally, these untraditional banking services
providers currently have a competitive advantage over traditional services providers as they aren’t subject to
banking regulations. The size of the EU (euro area) non-bank financial sector amounted to €37.6 trillion as of
the first quarter of 2020, while the assets included in the non-bank financial sector made up for around 53% of
the assets of the overall EU financial system (source: _EU Non-Bank Financial Intermediation Risk Monitor_
_2021, published by the European Systemic Risk Board)._

Any failure to compete with current competitors that also offer online services retaining and strengthening
customer relationships or to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging technologies or changes in customer
behavior, could have an adverse effect on the Group’s competitive position and business. Furthermore, the
increase in competition could also require an increase in the interest rates offered for deposits or the decrease
in interest rates applied to loans, with the subsequent negative impact in profitability, performance, market
shares and business perspectives of the Group.

### Macroeconomic risks

 The Group’s business primarily depends on the Spanish economy and therefore, any adverse changes to this or any adverse situation could have a negative impact on the Group

Following the merger with Liberbank, the Group has become the fifth largest bank in Spain in terms of total
assets, having presence across approximately 80% of the Spanish territory, with almost 100% of the Group’s
revenues derived from products and services sold in Spain. The Group’s business and performance therefore
depend significantly on economic conditions and market trends in Spain, particularly in the autonomous regions
in which the Group has developed a significant portion of its banking business (i.e., Andalucía, Cantabria,
Asturias, Extremadura, Castilla la Mancha and Castilla y León, together, the Group’s “Home Regions”) and,
to a lesser extent, on economic conditions in the EEA and globally. The Group believes that there are various
factors which could negatively affect the Spanish economy, including a potential slowdown or delay of the
macroeconomic recovery, elevated unemployment levels, the continued process of deleveraging of households,
firms, the public sector and other stakeholders in the Spanish economy or the historically low level of interest
rates to continue into the longer term, which could have an adverse effect on the Group’s activity.

Accordingly, any deterioration in Spain’s macroeconomic outlook should see increased levels of defaults and a
lower demand for credit. As a Spanish bank primarily focused on servicing individuals and SMEs, the Group’s
business performance is impacted by the economic health and employment status of its customers and high
levels of unemployment, especially in the Home Regions have historically resulted, for example, in a decrease

A46786082

22


-----

in new mortgage borrowing, lower deposit levels and reduced or deferred levels of consumer spending, which
adversely impact the Group’s revenue generation capability. In addition, higher unemployment rates can also
have a negative impact on the Group’s results through an increase in customer loan arrears, forbearance,
impairment provisions and defaults.

In particular, the spread and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic caused a contraction during 2020 in Spanish
gross domestic product (“GDP”) currently estimated at 11% (Source: National Institute of Statistics, INE). In
particular, according to the GDP growth estimations dated 18 June 2021, in 2020 the GDP contracted 10.7% in
Andalucía, 7.9% in Cantabria, 9.9% in Asturias, 6.9% in Extremadura, 7.2% in Castilla la Mancha and 8.7% in
Castilla y León (Source: _Fundación Cajas de Ahorro, Funcas). In the second quarter of 2021, the_
unemployment rate in Spain was 15.3%, 21.6% in Andalucía, 12.4% in Cantabria, 13.6% in Asturias, 19.1% in
Extremadura, 16.6% in Castilla la Mancha and 12.6% in Castilla y León (14%, 21%, 9%, 14.2%, 20.5%, 16.4%,
and 11.8%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2019) (Source: National Institute of Statistics, INE).

There is now uncertainty with respect to the on-going impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have and how
long it will last. However, the most recent forecast by the International Monetary Fund sets the growth of the
Spanish GDP at 5.9% in 2021 and 4.7% in 2022, while the Bank of Spain’s most recent forecast points to a
growth rate of 4.5% in 2021 and 5.4% in 2022. However, these forecasts are subject to potential revisions in
case of adverse COVID-19 developments in Spain and abroad.

The uncertain economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse
effect on Unicaja Banco’s results and financial and equity position, given the disruption to production and
consumption caused by the health crisis and the recession. Specifically, Unicaja Banco is exposed to numerous
risks that are common to the banking sector such as: a reduction in new mortgage and consumer lending granted
to retail customers, which made up 63.5% of Unicaja Banco’s total performing loan book as of 30 September
2021 (64.2% for Unicaja Banco and 60.6% for Liberbank as of 31 December 2020), and was down 4.1% for
Unicaja Banco year-on-year in 2020 (while for Liberbank increased a 7.2% year-on-year in 2020) as a result of
the fall in demand for credit during the lockdown); heightened credit risk, including an increased risk of
impairment of its assets (including financial instruments at fair value, which could suffer significant fluctuations
in value, and securities held for liquidity purposes) and increased impairment losses associated with higher
default rates; greater operational risk related with potential interruptions to business continuity and the provision
of services to customers; increased exposure to technological operational risk because the present situation has
led to an increase in the use of alternatives to face-to-face banking operations such as websites and apps and
the widespread use of remote working and flexible working hours; and a detrimental effect on Unicaja Banco’s
funding cost where access to funds is more limited, with the potential for its credit ratings to be negatively
affected.

The appearance of the aforementioned risks deriving from the COVID-19 pandemic could materially and
negatively affect Unicaja Banco’s banking, capital and funding activities and have a material adverse effect on
its business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

On the other hand, economic growth in Spain could be affected by poor economic performance in the EEA and
internal risks in the euro area. A market slump or weakening of the Spanish, European and global economies,
including due to the COVID-19 pandemic or to the uncertainty resulting from UK’s departure from the EU,
could materially and negatively affect Unicaja Banco’s banking, capital and funding activities and have a
material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

### The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is adversely affecting the Group and may adversely affect it in the future 

Since its outbreak, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has been affecting different industries and resulting
in a slowdown in economic activity, having a material adverse effect on economic growth in Spain, the EEA

A46786082

23


-----

and globally. Unicaja Banco has been continuously assessing and managing the impact on the Group’s financial
position and risk profile and the Group allocated provisions for credit amounting to €214 million in the ninemonth period ended on 30 September 2021, of which €36[28] million are due to the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic (€239 million in the year ended 31 December 2020 of which €200 million were due to the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic). Similarly, in recent months, legislators, regulators and supervisors, both at the
national and international level, have been issuing regulations, statements and guidelines, primarily to ensure
that financial institutions focus their efforts on performing critical economic functions to support the economy
as a whole and guarantee the consistent application of regulatory frameworks.

Accordingly, in 2020 the Spanish government approved several Royal Decree-Laws on extraordinary urgent
measures to address the economic and social impact of COVID-19, such as Royal Decree-Law 8/2020, of 17
March, on urgent extraordinary measures to cope with COVID-19’s economic and social impact (“RDL
**8/2020”) and Royal Decree-Law 11/2020, of 31 March, by virtue of which complementary urgent measures are**
adopted in social and economic areas to cope with COVID-19. These include most notably the extension of the
moratorium on evictions for vulnerable borrowers and the broadening of the concept of vulnerable groups, the
moratorium on mortgage debt for the purchase of the primary residence of retail customers and the moratorium
on consumer loans (the “Legal Moratoriums”), and the extension of public guarantees from the Spanish
Official Credit Institute (“ICO”) for affected companies and self-employed workers. In addition, other Royal
Decree-Laws were passed to support the following economic sectors: tourism, automotive, transport,
construction and energy.

Unicaja Banco complemented the public moratorium with other sector-specific moratoria, covered under the
sector-wide agreement between the member entities of the Spanish Savings & Loan Confederation
(Confederación Española de Cajas de Ahorro) on 16 April 2020 (the “Non-legal Moratorium”). The former
is applicable to borrowers (with borrowers continuing to pay interest) that (i) met only partially the eligibility
criteria for the Legal Moratoriums and/or (ii) required a longer period of adjustment in their mortgage payments.
The Group has temporarily reduced their mortgage and personal loan payments for a maximum of 12 months
or 6 months on mortgage-backed loans and personal loans, respectively.

The lower interest generated during the moratorium periods of the Legal Moratoriums had a negative impact in
the form of a lower net interest income. As regards Non-legal Moratorium, given that it was on capital and not
on interest, its main impact has been to help to reduce the number of clients who are at doubtful risk. These
effects will continue in the future for the duration of each moratoria.

Furthermore, since March 2020 the Group has been allowing transactions which have COVID-19 ICO-secured
facilities covered by RDL 8/2020 and on which certain fees are paid to the ICO depending on several factors
such as the nature of the transaction, the category of aid for which they are eligible, the type of borrower or the
term.

In relation to these measures, as of 30 September 2021, the Group’s current gross amount of moratorium
outstanding loans amounted to €191[29] million (0.35% of the total gross loan portfolio). As of 31 December
2020, the Group’s current gross amount of moratorium outstanding loans amounted to €567 million (2.1% of
the total gross loan portfolio), including both the legal moratorium (€11.8 million) and that derived from
additional sectorial agreements to the legal moratorium (€555.2 million). As of 30 September 2021, there were

28 This metric was determined for its inclusion and reported in Section 8 (Results) of the June 2021 Bank’s financial report and is still applicable

for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2021 given that no additional provisions due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic have been
allocated during the third quarter of 2021.

29 This metric has been obtained from the Bank’s accounting records as of 30 September 2021, and is determined in the same manner as the

corresponding metric as of 31 December 2020 included in Note 10.5 of the 2020 Consolidated Annual Accounts for its inclusion in this
Prospectus for comparison purposes.

A46786082

-----

not moratorium applications under analysis by the Group as all of them have been already processed and on
average the outstanding moratoriums have a maturity of approximately less than 3 months. Furthermore, total
government-backed funding lines granted as of 30 September 2021 amounted to €3,838 million, €897.2 million
as of 31 December 2020.

As of 31 December 2020, Liberbank reported a balance of €1,009.7 million in current loans under moratorium
and €1,763.6 million in government-backed lending.

Since March 2021, the Spanish government has passed several additional Royal Decree-Laws that will affect
the activity of the entire financial sector in the context of COVID-19. Of particular note are the extraordinary
measures to support corporate solvency, which will be channelled through three lines (i.e., direct aid, financial
debt restructuring and the corporate recapitalisation fund); the Code of Good Practices for the renegotiation
framework for customers with government-backed financing; the extension of the application deadline and
adaptation of the conditions of the aforementioned Royal Decree-Laws-regulated guarantees and the
development of the recovery system for issued guarantees.

The effects that the pandemic is causing (and that is expected to continue causing in the future) and the
exceptional measures taken by authorities are having, and may still in the future have, an adverse effect on the
Group’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Besides not being predictable, the
future effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Group’s business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects will depend on many circumstances and developments that the Group cannot control (including
subsequent waves of infections, the measures adopted to contain the disease and to mitigate its impact, the
effectiveness of the vaccination programme or, specifically for the banking sector, the measures and financial
stimulus packages implemented by regulators, central banks and governments).

### Internal operation risks

 After the Merger hidden or unknown liabilities and defects may emerge and Unicaja Banco may be unable to successfully integrate the Liberbank business from an operational point of view 

On 29 December 2020, Unicaja Banco announced that its Board of Directors had approved the joint merger
plan for the merger of Liberbank (absorbed company) into Unicaja Banco (absorbing company). The Merger
was approved by the shareholders’ meetings of Unicaja Banco and Liberbank, both held on 31 March 2021 and,
after obtaining the required authorisations, the Merger was registered with the Commercial Registry of Málaga
on 30 July 2021 and, thus, became effective as of that date.

The Merger had certain impacts on the Bank’s financial position, including €994 million of total net fair value
adjustments made at the date on which Unicaja Banco took control of Liberbank’s equity, €17 million of
acquisition expenses, €22 million for restructuring the branch network and IT and €143.2 million of provisions
made by Liberbank prior to the Merger for the purposes of personnel restructuring.

On 6 December 2021 the Bank announced that it had reached an agreement with the legal representatives of
the employees in connection with a redundancy scheme that will affect up to a maximum of 1,513 employees
and that will be implemented after the completion of the Merger. The estimated cost of the scheme will amount
to €368 million before taxes, equivalent to a reduction of 107 basis points in the fully-loaded CET1 ratio as of
30 September 2021.

Given the limited scope of the legal and business due diligence conducted on Liberbank, the assets and liabilities
transferred and acquired by Unicaja Banco by universal succession as a result of the Merger could conceal
material liabilities or defects that were not apparent or perceptible or known to Unicaja Banco, or that were not
detected, at the time of the due diligence or contingencies arising from past events that Unicaja Banco did not

A46786082

25


-----

know about or could not anticipate. Unicaja Banco may therefore be faced with unexpected and hidden
liabilities and contingencies and unplanned additional costs.

Additionally, integrating Liberbank in Unicaja Banco may be complex and may entail difficulties that are
beyond its control, and the costs, benefits and synergies arising from the integration may not be in line with
expectations. These difficulties may include incompatibility between the cultures or business policies of Unicaja
Banco and Liberbank, the integration of the different business operating procedures and systems or the
provision of services to, and the retention of, customers who, until the Merger, were part of the Liberbank
business.

The aforementioned difficulties and hidden liabilities could materially adversely affect the Group’s business,
reputation, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the ability of the Bank to maintain its
relationships with employees and suppliers or any other business relationships after the Merger, generating
unforeseen compensation costs and expenses.

To fully realise the expected benefits of the Merger, Unicaja Banco must overcome any difficulties and/or
hidden liabilities that may arise in the integration process. If it is unable to achieve these objectives or to achieve
them in the manner expected (within the initial deadline or at all) or if its assumptions are incorrect, the
efficiency, cost structure optimisation, increased presence in Spain, complementarity and market positioning
expected to result from the Merger may not be achieved in full (if at all) or may take longer than expected to
achieve, which could also materially adversely affect the Group’s business, reputation, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects.

Moreover, the need for the management team of Unicaja Banco to focus its attention on issues arising from the
integration with Liberbank, rather than on the ordinary conduct of the Bank’s business, could have an adverse
effect on Unicaja Banco’s business, especially given the general economic conditions in Spain, which may
evolve adversely. While engaged in the process of integrating the two businesses, the Bank may be unable to
react promptly or effectively to changes in the market.

The Group may also lose key employees as a result of factors relating to the difficulties of integrating the two
entities and efficiently managing a larger number of employees or uncertainty about Unicaja Banco. Any
inability of Unicaja Banco to manage the integration of Liberbank efficiently could have a material adverse
effect on the Group’s business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

### Operational risk is inherent to the Group’s business and, in particular, the Group faces risks from failures of its information technology systems or internal management systems or processes 

The Group is exposed to operational risks arising from the uncertainty inherent in the Group’s business
undertakings and decisions. Examples of operational risks include: (i) internal fraud (i.e., malicious damages
intentionally caused by internal parties); (ii) external fraud; (iii) compliance risk (i.e., violation of applicable
laws, rules or internal procedures); (iv) employment malpractices and lack of workplace safety; (v) failure to
meet obligations in relation to customers, products and business practices; (vi) disruption of infrastructure or
system failures; (vii) IT security breaches or cyberattacks; and (viii) inadequate monitoring of internal
compliance with regulations.

As of 31 December 2020, the own fund requirements associated to the operational risk of the Group and
Liberbank amounted to €126 million and €101.8 million, respectively[30].

30 The Group and Liberbank use the standardised approach to calculate the own fund requirements associated to operational risk, in accordance

with CRR I.

A46786082

26


-----

The Group’s technological infrastructure is critical to the operations of its business and delivery of products
and services to customers. As of 30 June 2021, the Group’s total volume of operations carried out through the
online and smartphone platforms amounted to €19,261 million while the percentage of Group’s customers using
these platforms were 38.5%. Even with the back-up recovery systems and contingency plans that the Group has
in place, the Group cannot assure that interruptions, failures, cyberattacks or breaches in capacity or security of
these processes and systems will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed.

This type of risk is especially relevant as the Group’s business depends on its ability to process a large number
of transactions efficiently and accurately and on the reliable use of information technology, computing services,
e-mails, software and network services, on the safe access to the processing, storage and transmission of
information (including confidential information) through computers and networks, and on the maintenance of
precise documentation, record-keeping and archiving.

Any materialization of operational risks could lead to losses, fines, claims and regulatory actions among other
possible effects, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, reputation, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects.

### Legal, regulatory and compliance risks
 The Group is subject to substantial governmental and supranational regulation and oversight

The financial services industry is among the most highly regulated industries in the world. The Group's
operations are subject to ongoing regulation and associated regulatory risks, including the effects of changes in
laws, regulations, policies and interpretations, in Spain and the EU. This is particularly the case in the current
market environment, which is witnessing increased levels of government and regulatory intervention in the
banking sector which is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. This creates significant uncertainty for
the Bank and the financial industry in general.

The regulations which most significantly affect the Group, or which could most significantly affect the Group
in the future, include regulations relating to capital, liquidity and funding requirements (see “Increasingly
_onerous capital, liquidity and funding requirements constitute one of the Group’s main regulatory challenges”)._
Another example are the continuous revisions on the NPLs coverage amounts expected by the regulator which
add more pressure on financial results (see “Capital, liquidity and funding requirements and loss absorbing
_powers—New NPLs coverage requirements”). It is also particularly noteworthy how regulation has also_
increased in terms of customer and investor protection and digital and technological matters. Other rules and
regulations that significantly affect the Group are those related to money laundering, corruption and the
financing of terrorism which have become increasingly complex and detailed and have become the subject of
enhanced government supervision.

In addition, the institutional structure in Europe for the supervision of financial institutions (with the single
supervisory mechanism (the “SSM”), and the single resolution mechanism (the “SRM”), governed by the
Single Resolution Board (the “SRB”)) and the discretion given to the competent authorities (as well as the
means at their disposal) have increased the supervisory pressure on the Group.

Any legislative, supervisory or regulatory measure, any change that may have to be made to the Group’s
business operations as a result of such measures or any deficiency in compliance with such measures could lead
to a significant loss of revenue, result in a limitation of the Group’s ability to exploit business opportunities or
offer certain products and services, affect the value of its assets, force it to increase its prices and thus reduce
the demand for its products, entail additional compliance costs or other possible adverse effects, or otherwise
materially adversely affect Unicaja Banco’s business. The occurrence of any of the aforementioned events
could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, prospects, financial condition, operating
results and cash flows. There is no guarantee that future changes in the regulations or supervisory measures
applicable to the Group, or in the interpretation or application thereof, will not adversely affect it.

A46786082

27


-----

In addition, the accounting standard setters and other regulatory bodies periodically change the financial
accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the stand-alone and consolidated financial
statements. These changes can materially impact how the Group records and reports its financial condition and
results of operations. In some cases, the Group could be required to apply a new or revised standard
retroactively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements. In particular, the results of the
Group could be adversely affected by the implementation of IFRS 17 in 2023. The Bank is currently analyzing
the effect of this standard and cannot anticipate as at the date of this Prospectus how it will impact the Group’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Adverse regulatory developments or changes in government policy relating to any of the foregoing or other
matters may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.

### Increasingly onerous capital, liquidity and funding requirements constitute one of the Group’s main regulatory challenges 

The Bank and the Group are subject to certain capital, liquidity and funding requirements (as described in the
section “Capital, liquidity and funding requirements and loss absorbing powers”). Changes to the solvency
requirements for credit institutions and to various transparency requirements, from a practical point of view,
give priority to the highest quality capital, common equity tier 1 (“CET1”), imposing stricter eligibility rules
and higher ratios, all with the aim of ensuring higher solvency standards in the financial sector. These changes,
in particular the setting of minimum capital ratios, together with the capital buffers required in anticipation of
future contingencies, the leverage ratio and the liquidity requirements, among others, are having an adverse
impact on the business and margins of banks. There can be no assurance that the application of the existing
regulatory requirements, standards or recommendations will not require the Group to issue additional securities
that qualify as regulatory capital or eligible securities (this requirement to issue additional securities may, in
addition, impair the ability of the Bank or the Group to manage their funding and capital resources in the most
efficient way), to liquidate assets, to impose business restrictions or to take any other actions, any of which may
have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

On 3 December 2020, the Bank was informed by the ECB of the results of the supervisory review and evaluation
process (the “SREP”), which include the supervisory decision regarding capital requirements applicable to the
Group for 2021 (applicable both at an individual and consolidated level). The details of these capital
requirements are described below:

**CET1 ratio** **[Total capital ]**

Pillar 1 ..................................................................................................................... 4.50% 8.00%

Pillar 2 (P2R)[31] ........................................................................................................ 0.98% 1.75%

Conservation buffer ................................................................................................. 2.50% 2.50%

Other buffers ........................................................................................................... 0.00% 0.00%

**Total requirement .................................................................................................** **7.98%** **12.25%**

The table below sets out the Group’s capital position as of 30 September 2021, 31 December 2020 and 31
December 2019:

31 P2R only applies at a consolidated level. This P2R has been set for Unicaja prior to the Merger and therefore is subject to change.

Total capital ratio ................. 16.6% 15.4% 18.2% 16.6% 17.1% 15.5%

As of 30 September 2021, the phased-in leverage ratio of the Group was 5.1% and the fully loaded leverage
ratio was 4.6% (CRR I sets a binding leverage ratio requirement of 3% of Tier 1 capital).

Additionally, as described in “Capital, liquidity and funding requirements and loss absorbing powers –MREL
_requirements”, the Bank, as a Spanish credit institution, must maintain a minimum requirement of own funds_
and eligible liabilities (known as “MREL”). In February 2021, the Bank received notification from the Bank
of Spain of its MREL requirement on a consolidated basis, as determined by the SRB. In accordance with such
communication, Unicaja Banco must comply by 1 January 2024 with a minimum of own funds and eligible
liabilities of 18.01% of the total risk exposure amount (“TREA”) (excluding the capital allocated to cover the
“combined buffer requirement”) and 5.24% of the leverage ratio exposure (“LRE”). As for the intermediate
requirement, the SRB has decided that, by 1 January 2022, Unicaja Banco must comply with an amount of own
funds and eligible liabilities on a consolidated basis equal to 15.63% of the TREA (excluding the capital
allocated to cover the “combined buffer requirement”) and 5.24% of the LRE. As of 30 September 2021,
Unicaja Banco reached a MREL ratio of 16.6% of the TREA and 5.6% of the LRE at consolidated level.
However, given that as of the date of this Prospectus the MREL requirement for the Group following the Merger
is still to be determined, the abovementioned MREL requirement might need to be adjusted. Therefore, as of
the date of this Prospectus, the Group cannot indicate the amount of issuances that will be needed in order to
meet with the MREL requirement to be set after the Merger.

Failure by the Bank or the Group to comply with certain of the existing regulatory requirements could result in
the imposition of administrative actions or sanctions, which would have a material adverse impact on the
Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any failure to comply with the
Bank’s or the Group’s capital requirements could result in further P2R (as defined in “Capital, liquidity and
_funding requirements and loss absorbing powers”) or the adoption of any early intervention or, ultimately,_
resolution measures by resolution authorities pursuant to Law 11/2015, of 18 June, on the recovery and
resolution of credit institutions and investment firms (“Law 11/2015”), which, together with Royal Decree
1012/2015, of 6 November, developing Law 11/2015 (“Royal Decree 1012/2015”) implemented BRRD into
Spanish law, which may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results
of operations.

In particular, non-compliance with the combined capital buffer requirement (or the combined capital buffer
requirement when considered in addition to the MREL requirements), requires Unicaja Banco to calculate the
Maximum Distributable Amount (or the MREL-Maximum Distributable Amount Provision) (each as defined
in “Capital, liquidity and funding requirements and loss absorbing powers”), so that it could become subject
to restrictions on (i) CET1 capital distributions, (ii) payments in respect of variable remuneration or
discretionary pension benefits and (iii) payments linked to additional tier 1 capital instruments, all such
discretionary payments being from then on subject to the resulting Maximum Distributable Amount (or the
MREL-Maximum Distributable Amount Provision, as applicable).

32 Capital ratios as of September 2021 include the profit for the nine-month period ended 30 September 2021, which is pending to be approved

by the ECB.

Moreover, it should not be disregarded that new and more demanding additional regulatory requirements,
standards or recommendations may be applied in the future.

Despite the flexibility measures adopted by the competent bodies in the present circumstances, the current
regulatory requirements and potential new and stricter regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on
the Group’s business and operations and, in particular, could affect its ability to pay dividends or make
discretionary payments. These regulations could therefore have a material adverse effect on the Groups
business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

### The Group is subject to regulatory and legal proceedings 

The Group is, and in the future may be, involved in various claims, disputes, legal proceedings and
governmental investigations. The outcome of these claims, disputes, legal proceedings and governmental
investigations is difficult to predict, and, therefore, the Issuer cannot state with confidence what the eventual
outcome of these pending matters will be or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending
matter may be or if the reserves accounted will be sufficient.

Unicaja Banco has recognized provisions covering obligations that may arise from various ongoing legal
proceedings, totaling €337.5 million as of 30 September 2021 (€197.3 million as of 31 December 2020 and
€254.5 million as of 31 December 2019). These provisions relate to several legal claims for amounts that are
not material by themselves and the majority of which are associated with potential claims relating to floor
clauses.

Regarding Liberbank, provisions held under “Outstanding procedural issues and litigation for taxes” amounted
to €2.6 million, while the provisions to cover the risks of lawsuits and proceedings arising from the ordinary
course of operations, along with other legal, regulatory and tax risks amounted to €70.3 million as of 31
December 2020 (€2.6 million and €59.4 million, respectively as of 31 December 2019).

While the Group has included provisions in its annual accounts to cover a potential adverse outcome of legal
proceedings, such provisions may prove inadequate or insufficient. In addition, defending current and future
actions is time-consuming and may result in the diversion of resources including management time.
Accordingly, any existing and significant future claims could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

See “Description of the Issuer—Legal and arbitration proceedings” for further on the legal proceedings referred
to above, a brief description of which is included below.

### Floor clauses litigation

Among the legal proceedings in which the Group is involved, there are several proceedings related to clauses
that set a minimum interest rate applicable to mortgage loans (known as “floor clauses”, which set minimum
interest rate payable by borrowers, whereby the borrower agrees to pay a minimum interest rate to the lender,
regardless of the applicable benchmark rate). Borrowers have challenged the validity of such clauses in recent
years on various grounds and courts have rendered various judgments, directed both at specific financial
institutions (including the Bank) and the financial sector in general, declaring the invalidity of these clauses
that set minimum interest rates.

As of 30 September 2021, the total outstanding principal amount of performing loans that include floor clauses
amounted to €789.3 million, representing 1.46% of the Group’s performing loans [33] and the Group has

33 Performing loans is an APM. For further information please see “Description of the Issuer—Alternative Performance Measures”.

recognised an accounting provision of €186 million to face risks and contingencies related to this matter (€123
million and €177 million as of 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019, respectively).

In addition, Liberbank has recognised accounting provisions totalling €18.75 million for obligations that may
arise due to floor clauses proceedings as of 31 December 2020 (€27.75 million as of 31 December 2019).

_Other litigation_

Other legal proceedings in which the Group is involved include legal proceedings in relation to (i) the
mandatory convertible bonds and perpetual contingent convertible bonds of the Bank issued on 27 December
2013 and offered to acquire the preference shares and contingent convertible bonds of EspañaDuero in 2014;
(ii) reference rate for mortgages (“Índice de Referencia de Préstamos Hipotecarios”, “IRPH”) potential
litigation (iii) the interest calculation formula used by the Group in mortgage transactions; (iv) the early
termination of mortgages; (v) the expenses relating to the formalization of mortgages; the (vi) revolving cards;
and (vii) claims in relation to Law 57/1968, of July 27, on the collection of advance amounts in the construction
and sale of housing (Ley 57/1968, de 27 de julio, sobre percibo de cantidades anticipadas en la construcción y
_venta de viviendas), which is still applicable to all purchases of housing made until 1 January 2016, for the_
amounts delivered by individuals to developers on account of the purchase of housing, when said payments had
been channeled through a credit institution.

### Risk of not recovering certain tax assets

As of 30 September 2021, the Group had deferred tax assets (“DTAs”) amounting to €4,679 million,
representing 4.3% of its total assets (€2,704 million as of 31 December 2020, representing 4.1% of its total
assets). As of 31 December 2020, CET 1 deductions related to DTAs amounted to €424.4 million and €639.9
million on a phased in and fully loaded basis, respectively. These assets or tax credits are mainly derived from
(i) negative taxable basis for corporate tax due to losses in a given fiscal year (carried forward tax losses), (ii)
bad debt provisions that have not been considered to be tax deductible and (iii) other temporary adjustments
recognized in a given fiscal year, that are pending to be applied.

Regarding Liberbank, as of 31 December 2020, it had DTAs amounting to €1,772.2 million, representing 3.7%
of its total assets. These tax assets are mainly derived from (i) negative taxable basis for corporate tax due to
losses in a given fiscal year (carried forward tax losses) and (ii) other temporary adjustments recognized in a
given fiscal year, that are pending to be applied.

The recovery of certain tax assets, in particular, deductions pending to be applied, is subject to certain time
limitations. However, the Group’s ability to recover tax assets in the future is not subject to time limitations,
provided that temporary differences are typically recovered following the recovery path foreseen accountingwise, and there is no time limit to offset carried forward tax losses.

Out of the €4,679 million total DTAs as of 30 September 2021 (€2,704 million as of 31 December 2020),
€1,043[34] million (€662 million as of 31 December 2020) are derived from carried forward tax losses. The
eventual recovery of these tax assets is subject to, or limited by, the occurrence of certain factors, such as
obtaining sufficient profits, the non-reduction of the corporate tax rate or the existence of discrepancies with
the Spanish tax authorities in the settlement of such tax. With regards to Liberbank, these DTAs amounted to
€642 million as of 31 December 2020.

Therefore, in the event that (i) the Group generates insufficient profits (or not profit at all) within the applicable
time to offset non-monetizable tax credits; (ii) the corporate income tax rate is reduced, resulting in a reduction

34 This metric has been obtained from the Bank’s accounting records as of 30 September 2021, and is determined in the same manner as the

corresponding metric as of 31 December 2020 included in Note 24.4 of the 2020 Consolidated Annual Accounts for its inclusion in this
Prospectus for comparison purposes.

-----

of the DTAs accounting wise or in a restriction to use certain DTAs subject to time limitations; (iii) discrepancies
are detected in previous tax returns as a consequence of audits undertaken by the Spanish tax authorities
resulting in a reduction of the Group’s DTAs; or (iv) there are changes in current regulations, or their application
or interpretation, the Group could be totally or partially restricted from recovering the amount of its DTAs,
which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, results of operations and/or financial
condition.

### Tax inspections 

Fundación Bancaria Unicaja, the Bank and some of its subsidiaries form part of the same Tax group (the “Tax
**Group”). On 11 January 2019, the Spanish tax authorities initiated a tax inspection related to the following**
taxes and years:

   - Corporate Income Tax for fiscal years 2014 to 2016;

   - Value Added Tax for fiscal years 2015 and 2016;

   - Withholding taxes (Personal Income Tax, Corporate Income Tax and Non-Residents Income Tax) for
fiscal years 2015 and 2016;

   - Customer deposits tax for fiscal years 2014 and 2016.

Furthermore, on 4 July 2019 a tax inspection was initiated against the Bank as the successor of Banco de Caja
de España de Inversiones, Salamanca y Soria, S.A., which is still ongoing, in relation to the taxes and fiscal
years mentioned above.

As of the date of this Prospectus, these tax inspections are still ongoing, and, taking into account that some tax
laws (or part of them) may be subject to different interpretations, the Group cannot conclude on whether any
discrepancy may be detected by the Spanish tax authorities.

Therefore, at this stage the Group cannot assess on whether a negative outcome of the tax inspections should
be expected, which, in such case, it could result in some tax liabilities being triggered or in a reduction of the
Group’s DTAs.

### RISKS RELATING TO THE NOTES

 The Notes may be subject to the exercise of the Spanish Bail-in Power and/or the Non-Viability Loss Absorption by the Relevant Resolution Authority and in general to the powers that may be exercised by the Relevant Resolution Authority under Law 11/2015 and the SRM Regulation

As further explained in “Capital, Liquidity and Funding Requirements and Loss Absorbing Powers - Loss
_absorbing powers by the Relevant Resolution Authority under Law 11/2015 and the SRM Regulation”, the Notes_
may be subject to the bail-in tool (the Spanish Bail-in Power as defined therein) and to the write down and
conversion powers (the Non-Viability Loss Absorption as defined therein) contemplated in article 59 of BRRD,
and in general to the powers that may be exercised by the Relevant Resolution Authority under Law 11/2015
and the SRM Regulation (as defined in the Conditions).

Holders may be subject to, among other things, on any application of the Spanish Bail-in-Power, a write down
(including to zero) or conversion into equity or other securities or obligations of amounts due under the Notes
and additionally may be subject to any Non-Viability Loss Absorption. The exercise of any such powers (or any
other resolution powers and tools) may result in such Holders losing some or all of their investment or otherwise
having their rights under the Notes adversely affected, including by receiving a different security, which may
be worth significantly less than the Notes.

A46786082

32


-----

Furthermore, the exercise of the Spanish Bail-in Power, with respect to the Notes or the taking by the Relevant
Resolution Authority of any other action, or any suggestion that such exercise or taking of any such action may
happen, could materially adversely affect the market price or value or trading behaviour of any Notes and/or
the ability of the Bank to satisfy its obligations under any Notes.

There may be limited protections, if any, that will be available to holders of securities subject to the Spanish
Bail-in Power and/or the Non-Viability Loss Absorption (including the Notes) and to the broader resolution
powers of the Relevant Resolution Authority. Accordingly, Holders of the Notes may have limited or
circumscribed rights to challenge any decision of the Relevant Resolution Authority to exercise such powers.

In particular, to the extent that any resulting treatment of a Holder of the Notes pursuant to the exercise of the
Spanish Bail-in Power or Non-Viability Loss Absorption is less favourable than would have been the case in
normal insolvency proceedings, a Holder of such affected Notes may have a right to compensation under the
BRRD and the SRM Regulation based on an independent valuation of the institution. Any such compensation,
together with any other compensation provided by any Applicable Banking Regulations is unlikely to
compensate that Holder for the losses it has actually incurred and there is likely to be a considerable delay in
the recovery of such compensation. Compensation payments (if any) are also likely to be made considerably
later than when amounts may otherwise have been due under the affected Notes. In addition, in the case of a
Non-Viability Loss Absorption, it is unclear that a Holder would have a right to compensation under the BRRD
and the SRM Regulation if any resulting treatment of such Holder pursuant to the exercise of the Non-Viability
Loss Absorption was less favourable than would have been the case in normal insolvency proceedings.

The exercise of the Spanish Bail-in Power and/or any Non-Viability Loss Absorption by the Relevant
Resolution Authority with respect to the Notes is likely to be inherently unpredictable and may depend on a
number of factors which may also be outside of the Bank’s control. In addition, as the Relevant Resolution
Authority will retain an element of discretion, Holders of the Notes may not be able to refer to publicly available
criteria in order to anticipate any potential exercise of any such Spanish Bail-in Power and/or any Non-Viability
Loss Absorption. Because of this inherent uncertainty, it will be difficult to predict when, if at all, the exercise
of any such powers by the Relevant Resolution Authority may occur.

Moreover, the Relevant Resolution Authority may exercise any such powers without providing any advance
notice to the Holders. The price and trading behaviour of the Notes and/or the Bank’s ability to satisfy its
obligations under the Notes may be affected by the threat of a possible exercise of any such powers.

### The obligations of the Bank under the Notes are subordinated

The payment obligations of the Bank under the Notes constitute direct, unconditional, unsecured and
subordinated obligations (créditos subordinados) of the Bank in accordance with Article 281.1 of the restated
text of the Spanish Insolvency Law approved by Legislative Royal Decree 1/2020, of 5 May (Real Decreto
_Legislativo 1/2020, de 5 de mayo, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley Concursal) (the_
“Insolvency Law”) read in conjunction with Additional Provision 14.3 of Law 11/2015, but subject to any other
ranking that may apply as a result of any mandatory provision of law (or otherwise) and upon the insolvency
of the Bank, for so long as the obligations of the Bank under the Notes qualify as Tier 2 Instruments would rank
as set out in Condition 2. For these purposes, as of the date of this Prospectus and according to Additional
Provision 14.3 of Law 11/2015, the ranking of the Notes and any other subordinated obligations of the Bank
may depend on whether those obligations qualify at the relevant time as Additional Tier 1 Instruments or Tier
2 Instruments (even partially) or constitute subordinated obligations of the Bank not qualifying as Additional
Tier 1 Instruments or Tier 2 Instruments. See Condition 2 for the complete provisions regarding the ranking of
the Notes.

As a result of this subordination, and insofar as the Notes qualify as Tier 2 Instruments (even partially), in the
case of any application of the Spanish Bail-in Power (see “The Notes may be subject to the exercise of the

A46786082

33


-----

_Spanish Bail-in Power and/or the Non-Viability Loss Absorption by the Relevant Resolution Authority and in_
_general to the powers that may be exercised by the Relevant Resolution Authority under Law 11/2015 and the_
_SRM Regulation”), any resulting write down or conversion shall affect the Notes (i) immediately after CET1_
items and other claims ranking below the Notes (including AT1 items) and (ii) ahead of claims ranking ahead
of the Notes, as further discussed in “Capital, Liquidity and Funding Requirements and Loss Absorbing
_Powers”._

In addition, if the Bank were wound up or liquidated, the Bank’s liquidator would first apply the assets of the
Bank to satisfy all claims of holders of unsubordinated obligations of the Bank and other creditors ranking
ahead of Holders. If the Bank does not have sufficient assets to settle claims of prior ranking creditors in full,
the claims of the Holders under the Notes will not be satisfied. Holders will share equally in any distribution of
assets with the holders of any other instrument ranking by law or by its terms, to the extent permitted by law,
_pari passu with the Notes if the Bank does not have sufficient funds to make full payment to all of them. In_
such a situation, Holders could lose all or part of their investment.

### The Notes provide for limited events of default 

The Conditions do not provide for any events of default, except in the case that an order is made by any
competent court commencing insolvency proceedings against the Bank or for its winding up or liquidation
(other than as permitted in Condition 6). Accordingly, in the event that any payment on the Notes is not made
when due, each Holder will have a claim only for amounts then due and payable on their Notes but will have
no right to accelerate such Notes.

Pursuant to the Insolvency Law those contractual provisions providing for the early termination of a contract
upon the insolvency of one of the parties shall be null and void, for which reason it is doubtful whether the
Notes may be accelerated if an order is made by any competent court commencing insolvency proceedings as
contemplated under Condition 6.

As mentioned above, pursuant to the BRRD, as implemented through Law 11/2015 and Royal Decree
1012/2015, and the SRM Regulation the Bank may be subject to a procedure of early intervention or resolution.
Pursuant to Law 11/2015 the adoption of any early intervention or resolution procedure shall not itself constitute
an event of default or entitle any counterparty of the Bank to exercise any rights it may otherwise have in respect
thereof. Any provision providing for such rights shall further be deemed not to apply, although this does not
limit the ability of a counterparty to declare any event of default and exercise its rights accordingly where an
event of default arises either before or after the adoption of any such procedure and does not necessarily relate
to the exercise of any relevant measure or power which has been applied pursuant to Law 11/2015.

Any attempt by a Holder to enforce its rights under the Notes following the adoption of any early intervention
or any resolution procedure will, therefore, be subject to the relevant provisions of the BRRD, as implemented
through Law 11/2015 and Royal Decree 1012/2015, and the SRM Regulation in relation to the exercise of the
relevant measures and powers pursuant to such procedure, including the resolution tools and powers referred
to above (see “—The Notes may be subject to the exercise of the Spanish Bail-in Power and/or the Non-Viability
_Loss Absorption by the Relevant Resolution Authority and in general to the powers that may be exercised by_
_the Relevant Resolution Authority under Law 11/2015 and the SRM Regulation”)._

There can be no assurance that the taking of any such action would not adversely affect the rights of Holders
(in particular, any rights a Holder may otherwise have on the occurrence of any such action may be limited in
these circumstances), the price or value of their investment in the Notes and/or the ability of the Bank to satisfy
its obligations under the Notes.

A46786082

### The Notes may be redeemed at the option of the Bank 

All, but not some only of the Notes may be redeemed at the option of the Bank on any day falling in the period
commencing on (and including) 19 January 2027 and ending on (and including) the Reset Date, at their principal
amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to (but excluding) the date fixed for redemption.

The redemption of the Notes at the option of the Bank is subject to the prior Supervisory Permission (as defined
in the Conditions) and compliance with Applicable Banking Regulations then in force.

Under the CRR I (as defined in the Conditions), Supervisory Permission to redeem own funds shall be given
by the Competent Authority provided that either of the following conditions is met:

(i) before or at the same time as such redemption, the Bank replaces the instruments with own funds
instruments of equal or higher quality at terms that are sustainable for the income capacity of the Bank;
or

(ii) the Bank has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Competent Authority that its own funds and eligible
liabilities would, following such redemption, exceed the requirements for own funds and eligible
liabilities laid down in CRR I, CRD IV and BRRD by a margin that the Competent Authority considers
necessary.

The Notes are also redeemable on or after the Issue Date at the option of the Bank in whole but not in part, at
any time, at their principal amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to (but excluding) the
date fixed for redemption (subject to the prior Supervisory Permission and otherwise in accordance with
Applicable Banking Regulations then in force) if there is a Capital Event or a Tax Event (each as defined in the
Conditions). In this case, in addition to the above-described conditions, redemption requires that the Bank
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Competent Authority that such Capital Event or Tax Event was not
reasonably foreseeable at the Issue Date and, in the case of a Tax Event, that the Tax Event is material.
Furthermore, in the case of a Capital Event, the Competent Authority must consider that such Capital Event is
sufficiently certain.

It is not possible to predict whether or not any further change in the laws or regulations of the Kingdom of
Spain, Applicable Banking Regulations or, in the case of a redemption of the Notes for tax reasons, the
application or official interpretation thereof, or any of the other events referred to above, will occur and so lead
to the circumstances in which the Bank is able to elect to redeem the Notes, and if so whether or not the Bank
will elect to exercise such option to redeem the Notes or any prior consent of the Competent Authority required
for such redemption will be given. There can be no assurances that, in the event of any such early redemption,
Holders will be able to reinvest the proceeds at a rate that is equal to the return on the Notes.

In addition, the Notes are intended to be MREL-Eligible Instruments under the Applicable Banking
Regulations. However, there is uncertainty regarding how the EU Banking Reforms may be interpreted and
applied by the relevant authorities and the Bank cannot provide any assurance that the Notes will or may be (or
thereafter remain) MREL-Eligible Instruments. Because of this uncertainty, the Bank cannot provide any
assurance that the Notes will or may ultimately be (or thereafter remain) MREL-Eligible Instruments. If for any
reasons the Notes are not MREL-Eligible Instruments or if they initially are MREL-Eligible Instruments and
subsequently become ineligible, then a MREL Disqualification Event (as defined in the Conditions) may occur.
In such case, the Bank may redeem the Notes but only after five years from the Issue Date and subject to the
prior Supervisory Permission and otherwise in accordance with Applicable Banking Regulations then in force.

The redemption features of the Notes are likely to limit their market value. During any period when the Bank
has the right to elect to redeem the Notes or there is a perceived increase in the likelihood that the Bank will
exercise the right to elect to redeem the Notes, the market value of the Notes is unlikely to rise substantially
above the price at which they can be redeemed. This may also be true prior to such period.

A46786082

35


-----

### The terms of the Notes contain a waiver of set-off rights

The Conditions provide that Holders waive any set-off, netting, compensation, retention or counterclaim rights
against any right, claim, or liability the Bank has, may have or acquire against any Holder, directly or indirectly,
howsoever arising, as required by Applicable Banking Regulations. As a result, Holders will not at any time be
entitled to set-off the Bank’s obligations under the Notes against obligations owed by them to the Bank.

### The interest rate on the Notes will be reset on the Reset Date, which may affect the market value of the Notes 

The Notes will bear interest at an initial fixed rate of interest from (and including) the Issue Date to (but
excluding) the Reset Date. From (and including) the Reset Date, the interest rate will be reset at the Reset Rate
of Interest (the sum of the 5-year Mid-Swap Rate and the Margin) as described in Condition 3. The Reset Rate
of Interest could be less than the initial interest rate which could affect the market value of an investment in the
Notes.

### Substitution and variation of the Notes without Holder consent

Subject to Condition 4.6, if a Tax Event, a MREL Disqualification Event or a Capital Event occurs, the Bank
may, instead of redeeming the Notes, at any time, without the consent of the Holders, and subject to compliance
with Applicable Banking Regulations and to the prior Supervisory Permission, either (a) substitute new notes
for all (but not some only) the Notes whereby such new notes shall replace the Notes or (b) vary the terms of
all (but not some only) the Notes, so that the Notes may become or remain Qualifying Tier 2 Notes (as defined
in the Conditions), provided that such substitution or variation shall not result in terms that are materially less
favourable to the Holders, as certified in a Bank’s Certificate (as defined in the Conditions) and an Independent
Financial Adviser Certificate (as defined in the Conditions). In the exercise of its discretion, the Bank will have
regard to the interest of the Holders as a class.

While Qualifying Tier 2 Notes must contain terms that are materially no less favourable to Holders as the
original terms of the Notes, there can be no assurance that the terms of any Qualifying Tier 2 Notes will be
viewed by the market as equally or more favourable, or that the Qualifying Tier 2 Notes will trade at prices that
are equal to or higher than the prices at which the Notes would have traded on the basis of their original terms.

Moreover, prior to the making of any such substitution or variation, the Bank shall not be obliged to have regard
to the tax position of individual Holders or to the tax consequences of any such substitution or variation for
individual Holders. No Holder shall be entitled to claim, whether from the Bank, or any other person, any
indemnification or payment in respect of any tax consequence of any such substitution or variation upon
individual Holders of Notes.

### Risks relating to the 5-year Mid-Swap Rate and other “benchmarks”

The calculation of the interest in respect of the Notes after the Reset Date is dependent upon the relevant 5-year
Mid-Swap Rate and, only if the 5-year Mid-Swap Rate does not appear on the relevant Screen Page at the
relevant time on the Reset Determination Date, the EURIBOR 6-month as determined at the relevant time (as
specified in the Conditions). Certain interest rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” (including
the 5-year Mid-Swap Rate and the EURIBOR) have been the subject of recent national and international
regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, including the Benchmark Regulation, which applies to the
provision of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of a benchmark, within the
EU. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may
change with the result that they may perform differently than in the past or other consequences which cannot
be predicted.

In this respect, the Benchmark Regulation applies to “contributors”, “administrators” and “users” of
“benchmarks” in the EU, and, among other things, (i) requires benchmark administrators to be authorised or

A46786082

36


-----

registered (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regime or otherwise recognised or endorsed) and
to comply with extensive requirements in relation to the administration of “benchmarks” (or, if non-EU based,
to be subject to equivalent requirements), (ii) prevents certain uses by EU supervised entities (such as the Issuer)
of “benchmarks” of administrators that are not authorised/registered (or, if non-EU based, deemed equivalent
or recognised or endorsed), and (iii) requires benchmark administrators to publish a benchmark statement for
each benchmark (or, where applicable, for each family of benchmarks) containing the criteria and procedures
used to determine the benchmark, and advising users that changes to, or the cessation of, the benchmark may
have an impact upon the financial contracts and financial instruments that reference the benchmark.

These reforms could have a material impact on the Notes, its value and return, in particular, if the methodology
or other terms of any benchmarks are changed in order to comply with new requirements. Such changes or the
general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks could, among other things, have the effect of reducing,
increasing or otherwise affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the relevant benchmark and
increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a benchmark and
complying with any such regulations or requirements. Such factors may have the following effects on certain
benchmarks: (i) discourage market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to the benchmark;
(ii) trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in the benchmark; or (iii) lead to the disappearance of
the benchmark.

If at the time of determination of the Reset Rate of Interest a Benchmark Event (as defined in the Conditions)
occurs or has occurred and is continuing, then the Bank shall use its reasonable endeavours to appoint an
Independent Financial Adviser, as soon as reasonably practicable, to determine a Successor Rate or, failing
which, an Alternative Rate (as defined in the Conditions). If the Bank is unable to appoint an Independent
Financial Adviser or the Independent Financial Adviser appointed by it fails to determine a Successor Rate or,
failing which, an Alternative Rate, the Bank (following consultation with the Independent Financial Adviser, if
any) may determine a Successor Rate or, failing which, an Alternative Rate. Therefore, in certain circumstances,
an independent third party may not be involved in the determination of the Successor Rate or Alternative Rate,
and of the Adjustment Spread.

The use of any such Successor Rate or Alternative Rate to determine a Reset Rate of Interest will result in the
Notes performing differently (which may include payment of a lower rate of interest) than they would do if the
Original Reference Rate continued to apply.

If the Bank is unable to appoint an Independent Financial Adviser or if the Independent Financial Adviser
appointed by it fails to determine a Successor Rate or, failing which, an Alternative Rate and the Issuer is unable
or unwilling to determine the Successor Rate or Alternative Rate, the Reset Rate of Interest shall be determined
using the 5-Year Mid Swap Rate last displayed on the relevant Screen Page prior to the Reset Determination
Date. This may result in effective application of a fixed rate of interest for Notes which are initially designated
to be fixed reset securities. In addition, due to the uncertainty concerning the availability of a Successor Rate
or an Alternative Rate and the involvement of an Independent Financial Adviser, the relevant fallback provisions
may not operate as intended at the relevant time.

If a Successor Rate or Alternative Rate is determined by the Independent Financial Adviser or the Issuer (as
applicable), the Conditions also provide that an Adjustment Spread may be determined by the Independent
Financial Adviser or the Issuer, as applicable, and applied to such Successor Rate or Alternative Rate. In certain
circumstances, the Adjustment Spread is the spread (which may be positive, negative or zero), quantum, formula
or methodology determined to be appropriate to reduce to the extent reasonably practicable in the
circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to the Holders as a result of the
replacement of the Original Reference Rate with the Successor Rate or the Alternative Rate (as the case may
be). However, such Adjustment Spread may not be effective to reduce the economic prejudice to Holders or it

A46786082

37


-----

may not be possible to determine or apply an Adjustment Spread (if no Adjustment Spread can be determined,
a Successor Rate or Alternative Rate may nonetheless be used to determine the relevant rate of interest).

Furthermore, if a Successor Rate or Alternative Rate is determined in accordance with the Conditions, the
Independent Financial Adviser or the Bank (as applicable), may vary certain aspects of the Conditions, as
necessary, to ensure the proper operation of such Successor Rate, Alternative Rate and/or Adjustment Spread,
without any requirement for consent or approval of the Holders.

The use of any Successor Rate or Alternative Rate (including with the application of an Adjustment Spread and
also including any other amendment to the Conditions) may result in the Notes performing differently (which
may include payment of a lower rate of interest) than they would if the relevant benchmark were to continue to
apply.

Investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential
risks imposed by the Benchmark Regulation reforms in making any investment decision with respect to the
Notes.

### Limitation on gross-up obligation under the Notes

The Bank’s obligation under Condition 7 to pay additional amounts in the event of any withholding or deduction
for or on account of taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature on any payments of
interest and other amounts payable does not apply to any repayment of principal. Accordingly, if any such
withholding or deduction were to apply, Holders of the Notes may receive less than the full amount of principal
due under the Notes upon redemption, and the market value of the Notes may be adversely affected.

### Credit ratings may not reflect all risks associated with an investment in the Notes 

The Notes have been rated BB by Fitch. Ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to
structure, market, additional factors discussed above, and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes.

Similar ratings assigned to different types of securities do not necessarily mean the same thing and any rating
assigned to the Notes does not address the likelihood that interest (or any additional amounts payable in
accordance with Condition 7) or any other payments in respect of the Notes will be made on any particular date
or at all. Credit ratings also do not address the marketability or market price of securities.

Any change in the credit ratings assigned to the Notes may affect the market value of the Notes. Such change
may, among other factors, be due to a change in the methodology applied by a rating agency to rating securities
with similar structures to the Notes, as opposed to any revaluation of the Bank’s financial strength or other
factors such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally.

In addition, rating agencies may assign unsolicited ratings on the Notes. In such circumstances, there can be no
assurance that such rating will not differ from, or be lower than, the ratings initially provided by Fitch to the
Notes. The decision to decline a rating assigned by a hired rating agency, the delayed publication of such rating
or the assignment of a non-solicited rating by a rating agency not hired by the Bank could adversely affect the
market value and liquidity of the Notes.

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension
or withdrawal, at any time, by the assigning rating organisation. Therefore, potential investors should not rely
on any rating of the Notes and should make their investment decision on the basis of considerations such as
those outlined above. The Bank or its Group does not participate in any decision making of the rating agencies
and any revision or withdrawal of any credit rating assigned to the Bank or any securities of the Bank is a third
party decision for which the Bank does not assume any responsibility.

A46786082

38


-----

In general, European (including UK) regulated investors are restricted under the UK CRA Regulation from
using credit ratings for regulatory purposes, unless such ratings are issued by a credit rating agency established
in the EU and UK and registered under the CRA Regulation or the UK CRA Regulation, as applicable (and
such registration has not been withdrawn or suspended). If the status of the rating agency of the Notes changes,
European (including UK) regulated investors may no longer be able to use the rating for regulatory purposes
and the Notes may have a different regulatory treatment. This may result in European (including UK) regulated
investors selling the Notes which may impact the value of the Notes in the secondary market.

### CONDITIONS OF THE NOTES

_The following is the text of the Conditions of the Notes._

The Notes (as defined below) have been issued by Unicaja Banco, S.A. (the “Bank”) by virtue of the resolutions
passed by (a) the general shareholders’ meeting of the Bank, held on 27 April 2018, and (b) the meeting of the
Board of Directors (Consejo de Administración) of the Bank, held on 17 December 2021.

**1** **Form, Denomination and Title**

1.1 The Notes have been issued in uncertificated, dematerialised book-entry form (anotaciones en cuenta)
in euro in an aggregate nominal amount of €300,000,000 and in the denomination of €100,000 (as
reduced from time to time by any write down or cancellation, as the case may be, the “principal
**amount” of a Note).**

1.2 The Notes have been registered with Iberclear as managing entity of the central registry of the Spanish
settlement system (the “Spanish Central Registry”). Holders of a beneficial interest in the Notes who
do not have, directly or indirectly through their custodians, a participating account with Iberclear may
participate in the Notes through bridge accounts maintained by each of Euroclear Bank SA/NV
(“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, S.A. (“Clearstream Luxembourg”) with Iberclear.

Iberclear manages the settlement of the Notes, notwithstanding the Bank’s commitment to assist, when
appropriate, on the clearing and settlement of the Notes through Euroclear and Clearstream Luxembourg.

The Spanish National Numbering Agency (Agencia Nacional de Codificación de Valores Mobiliarios)
has assigned the following International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) to identify the Notes:
ES0280907025. The Common Code for this issue is 243435269.

1.3 Title to the Notes is evidenced by book entries, and each person shown in the Spanish Central Registry
managed by Iberclear and in the registries maintained by the Iberclear Members as having an interest in
the Notes shall be (except as otherwise required by Spanish law) considered the holder of the principal
amount of the Notes recorded therein. In these Conditions, the “Holder” means the person in whose
name such Notes are for the time being registered in the Spanish Central Registry managed by Iberclear
or, as the case may be, the relevant Iberclear Member accounting book (or, in the case of a joint holding,
the first named thereof) and Holder shall be construed accordingly.

One or more certificates (each a “Certificate”) attesting to the relevant Holder’s holding of Notes in the
relevant registry will be delivered by the relevant Iberclear Member or by Iberclear (in each case, in
accordance with the requirements of Spanish law and the relevant Iberclear Member's or, as the case
may be, Iberclear's procedures) to such Holder upon such Holder's request.

The Notes have been issued without any restrictions on their transferability. Consequently, the Notes
may be transferred and title to the Notes may pass (subject to Spanish law and to compliance with all
applicable rules, restrictions and requirements of Iberclear or, as the case may be, the relevant Iberclear
Member) upon registration in the relevant registry of each Iberclear Member and/or Iberclear itself, as
applicable. Each Holder will be (except as otherwise required by Spanish law) treated as the absolute
owner of the relevant Notes for all purposes (whether or not it is overdue and regardless of any notice
of ownership, trust or any interest, or any writing on, or the theft or loss of, the Certificate issued in
respect of it), and no person will be liable for so treating the Holder.

**2** **Status of Notes**

The payment obligations of the Bank under the Notes constitute direct, unconditional, unsecured and
subordinated obligations (créditos subordinados) of the Bank in accordance with Article 281.1 of the

A46786082

42


-----

Insolvency Law and, in accordance with Additional Provision 14.3 of Law 11/2015, but subject to any other
ranking that may apply as a result of any mandatory provision of law (or otherwise), upon the insolvency
(concurso) of the Bank, for so long as the obligations of the Bank under the Notes qualify as Tier 2 Instruments,
would rank:

(a) senior to:

(i) any subordinated obligations (créditos subordinados) of the Bank qualifying as Additional
Tier 1 Instruments;

(ii) any claims for the liquidation amount of the ordinary shares of the Bank, and

(iii) any other subordinated obligations (créditos subordinados) of the Bank which by law
and/or by their terms, to the extent permitted by Spanish law, rank junior to the Bank's
obligations under the Notes;

(b) _pari passu among themselves and with:_

(i) any other subordinated obligations (créditos subordinados) of the Bank qualifying as Tier
2 Instruments; and

(ii) any other subordinated obligations (créditos subordinados) of the Bank which by law
and/or by their terms, to the extent permitted by Spanish law, rank _pari passu with the_
Bank's obligations under the Notes; and

(c) junior to:

(i) any unsubordinated obligations (créditos ordinarios) of the Bank;

(ii) any other subordinated obligations (créditos subordinados) of the Bank under Article 281.1
of the Insolvency Law not qualifying as Additional Tier 1 Instruments or Tier 2 Instruments;
and

(iii) any other subordinated obligations (créditos subordinados) of the Bank which by law
and/or by their terms, to the extent permitted by Spanish law, rank senior to the Bank's
obligations under the Notes.

The payment obligations of the Bank under the Notes are subject to, and may be limited by, the exercise of any
Loss Absorbing Powers. The Notes are not subject to any set-off or netting arrangements that would undermine
their capacity to absorb losses in resolution. The Notes are neither secured, nor subject to a guarantee or any
other arrangement that enhances the seniority of the claims under the Notes.

**3** **Interest Payments**

3.1 **_Interest Rate_**

The Notes bear interest on their outstanding principal amount at the applicable Interest Rate from (and
including) the Issue Date in accordance with the provisions of this Condition 3.

Interest shall be payable on the Notes annually in arrear on each Interest Payment Date as provided in
this Condition 3.

Where it is necessary to compute an amount of interest in respect of any Note for a period which is less
than a complete Interest Period, the relevant day-count fraction shall be determined on the basis of the
number of days in the relevant period, from and including the date from which interest begins to accrue

A46786082

43


-----

to but excluding the date on which it falls due, divided by the actual number of days in the Interest Period
in which the relevant period falls (including the first such day but excluding the last).

3.2 **_Interest Accrual_**

The Notes will cease to bear interest from (and including) the due date for redemption thereof pursuant
to Condition 4.1, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 or 4.6 or the date of cancellation thereof pursuant to Condition 4.9, as the
case may be, unless payment of all amounts due in respect of such Note (if any) is not properly and duly
made, in which event interest shall continue to accrue on the Notes, both before and after judgment, and
shall be payable, as provided in these Conditions up to (but excluding) the Relevant Date. Interest in
respect of any Note for any period shall be equal to the product of the outstanding principal amount of
the Note, the relevant Interest Rate and the day-count fraction as described in Condition 3.1 for the
relevant period, rounding the resultant figure to the nearest cent (half a cent being rounded upwards).

3.3 **_Initial Fixed Interest Rate_**

During the Initial Fixed Rate Interest Period, the Notes bear interest at the rate of 3.125% per annum
(the “Initial Fixed Interest Rate”). The amount of interest payable on each Interest Payment Date
during the Initial Fixed Rate Interest Period shall be €3,125 in respect of each Note of €100,000
denomination, except for the amount of interest payable on the first Interest Payment Date, which shall
be €1,549.66 in respect of each Note of €100,000 denomination.

3.4 **_Reset Rate of Interest_**

The Interest Rate will be reset (the “Reset Rate of Interest”) in accordance with this Condition 3 on the
Reset Date. The Reset Rate of Interest will be determined by the Bank on the Reset Determination Date
as the sum of the 5-year Mid-Swap Rate and the Margin. From (and including) the Reset Date the Notes
bear interest at the Reset Rate of Interest.

3.5 **_Determination of Reset Rate of Interest_**

The Bank will, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Central European time) on the Reset
Determination Date, determine the Reset Rate of Interest in respect of the Reset Period.

3.6 **_Publication of Reset Rate of Interest_**

The Bank shall cause notice of the Reset Rate of Interest determined in accordance with this Condition
3 in respect of the Reset Period to be given to Holders in accordance with Condition 10 as soon as
practicable after its determination but in any event not later than the fourth Business Day after the Reset
Determination Date.

3.7 **_Benchmark discontinuation_**

_(a)_ _Independent Financial Adviser_

If at the time of determination of the Reset Rate of Interest, a Benchmark Event occurs or has
occurred and is continuing, then the Bank shall use its reasonable endeavours to appoint an
Independent Financial Adviser, as soon as reasonably practicable, to determine a Successor Rate,
failing which an Alternative Rate (in accordance with Condition 3.7(b)) and, in either case, an
Adjustment Spread if any (in accordance with Condition 3.7(c)) and any Benchmark
Amendments (in accordance with Condition 3.7(d)).

If the Bank (i) is unable to appoint an Independent Financial Adviser; or, (ii) the Independent
Financial Adviser appointed by it fails to determine a Successor Rate or, failing which, an
Alternative Rate in accordance with this Condition 3.7(a) prior to the Reset Determination Date,

A46786082

44


-----

A46786082


the Bank (acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner and following
consultation with the Independent Financial Adviser in the event one has been appointed) may
determine a Successor Rate or, failing which, an Alternative Rate.

If the Bank is unable or unwilling to determine a Successor Rate or an Alternative Rate prior to
the Reset Determination Date, the Reset Rate of Interest shall be determined using the 5-Year
Mid Swap Rate last displayed on the relevant Screen Page prior to the Reset Determination Date.

_(b)_ _Successor Rate or Alternative Rate_

If the Independent Financial Adviser or the Bank, acting in good faith and in a reasonable
commercial manner and following consultation with the Independent Financial Adviser in the
event one has been appointed, as applicable, determines that:

(i) there is a Successor Rate, then such Successor Rate shall (subject to adjustment as
provided in Condition 3.7(c)) subsequently be used in place of the Original Reference
Rate to determine the Reset Rate of Interest (or the relevant component part thereof) for
the Reset Period (subject to the operation of this Condition 3.7); or

(ii) there is no Successor Rate but that there is an Alternative Rate, then such Alternative Rate
shall (subject to adjustment as provided in Condition 3.7(c)) subsequently be used in place
of the Original Reference Rate to determine the Reset Rate of Interest (or the relevant
component part thereof) for the Reset Period (subject to the operation of this Condition
3.7).

_(c)_ _Adjustment Spread_

If the Independent Financial Adviser or the Bank, acting in good faith and in a reasonable
commercial manner and following consultation with the Independent Financial Adviser in the
event one has been appointed, as applicable, determines (i) that an Adjustment Spread is required
to be applied to the Successor Rate or the Alternative Rate (as the case may be) and (ii) the
quantum of, or a formula or methodology for determining, such Adjustment Spread, then such
Adjustment Spread shall be applied to the Successor Rate or the Alternative Rate (as the case
may be).

_(d)_ _Benchmark Amendments_

If any Successor Rate, Alternative Rate and/or Adjustment Spread is determined in accordance
with this Condition 3.7 and the Independent Financial Adviser or the Bank, acting in good faith
and in a reasonable commercial manner and following consultation with the Independent
Financial Adviser in the event one has been appointed, as applicable, determines (i) that
amendments to the day count fraction, the business days convention, the Reset Determination
Date, the floating leg of the 5-year Mid-Swap Rate, the Reset Rate of Interest, and the method
for determining the fallback rate in relation to the Notes are necessary in order to follow market
practice in relation to the Successor Rate or Alternative Rate and/or Adjustment Spread (such
amendments, the “Benchmark Amendments”) and (ii) the terms of the Benchmark
Amendments, then the Bank shall, subject to giving notice thereof in accordance with Condition
3.7(e), without any requirement for consent or approval of the Holders, vary these Conditions to
give effect to such Benchmark Amendments with the date specified in such notice.

In connection with any such variation in accordance with this Condition 3.7(d), the Bank shall
comply with the rules of any stock exchange on which the Notes are for the time being listed or
admitted to trading.

_(e)_ _Notices, etc._

Any Successor Rate, Alternative Rate, Adjustment Spread and the specific terms of any
Benchmark Amendments determined under this Condition 3.7 will be notified promptly by the
Bank to the Holders in accordance with Condition 10. Such notice shall be irrevocable and shall
specify the effective date of the Benchmark Amendments, if any, and will be binding on the Bank
and the Holders.

_(f)_ _Survival of Original Reference Rate_

Without prejudice to the obligations of the Bank under this Condition 3.7, the Original Reference
Rate and the fallback provisions otherwise provided for in these Conditions will continue to apply
unless and until a Benchmark Event has occurred.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Condition 3.7, no Successor Rate, Alternative Rate,
Adjustment Spread or Benchmark Amendments (as applicable) will be adopted, if and to the extent that,
in the determination of the Bank, the same could reasonably be expected to prejudice the qualification
of the Notes as Tier 2 Capital of the Bank or the Group or to result in the partial or full exclusion of the
Notes from treatment as MREL-Eligible Instruments of the Group, or could reasonably result in the
Relevant Resolution Authority treating any future Interest Payment Date (including any Reset Date) as
the effective maturity of the Notes, rather than the relevant maturity date (i.e. 19 July 2032).

eligible liabilities would, following such redemption, repayment or repurchase, exceed the

Prior to the publication of any notice of substitution, variation or redemption pursuant to Conditions 4.4,
4.5, 4.6 and 4.7, the Bank shall make available to the Holders at its registered office a certificate signed

prior Supervisory Permission as required under the Applicable Banking Regulations in effect at the
relevant time, the Holder shall be obliged to repay in full to the Bank or the relevant member of the
Group, as the case may be, any amounts received by it in consideration of such purchase.

**5** **Payments**

5.1 **_Method of Payment_**

Payments of principal and interest in respect of the Notes will be made in euro by transfer to the
registered euro account of the relevant Holder maintained by or on behalf of it with a bank that processes
payments in a city in which banks have access to the TARGET System, details of which appear in the
records of Iberclear or, as the case may be, the relevant Iberclear Member at close of business on the day
immediately preceding the date on which the payment of principal or interest, as the case may be, falls
due. Holders must rely on the procedures of Iberclear or, as the case may be, the relevant Iberclear
Member to receive payments under the relevant Notes. The Bank will have no responsibility or liability
for the records relating to payments made in respect of the Notes.

5.2 **_Payments Subject to Laws_**

Save as provided in Condition 7, payments will be subject in all cases to any applicable fiscal or other
laws, regulations and directives in the place of payment or other laws or regulations to which the Bank

Resolution at a meeting of Holders of the Notes; or (ii) where the entity resulting from any such reconstruction,
merger or amalgamation is (A) a financial institution (entidad de crédito) under article 1 of Law 10/2014, as
amended and restated and (B) has a rating for long-term subordinated debt assigned by a Rating Agency
equivalent to or higher than the rating for long-term subordinated debt of the Bank immediately prior to such
reconstruction, merger or amalgamation) and such order is continuing, then any Note may, unless there has
been an Extraordinary Resolution to the contrary at a meeting of Holders, by written notice addressed by the
Holder thereof to the Bank and delivered to the Bank, be declared immediately due and payable, whereupon
the principal amount of such Notes together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of payment
shall, when permitted by applicable Spanish law, become immediately due and payable without further action
or formality.

-----

If a default occurs under this Condition 6, claims of Holders in respect of the Notes shall rank as set out under
Condition 2.

Except as set out in this Condition 6, Holders shall have no right to declare immediately due and payable any
amounts of principal or interest in respect of the Notes.

By its acquisition of any Note, each Holder acknowledges and accepts that the taking by the Relevant Resolution
Authority of an early intervention measure or a resolution action in respect of the Bank under the Applicable
Banking Regulations shall not constitute an event of default and Holders shall have no right to declare
immediately due and payable any amounts of principal or interest in respect of the Notes.

be made free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for or on account of, any present or future

required by law. In the event that any such withholding or deduction is imposed or levied by or on behalf of the
Kingdom of Spain or any political subdivision thereof or any authority or agency therein or thereof having
power to tax in respect of payments of interest and any other amounts (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
any repayment of principal), the Bank shall pay such additional amounts as will result in Holders receiving such
amounts as they would have received in respect of such payments of interest and any other amounts had no
such withholding or deduction been required.

The Bank shall not be required to pay any additional amounts in relation to any payment in respect of Notes:

(a) presented for payment by or on behalf of a Holder who is liable for such taxes, duties, assessments
or governmental charges in respect of the Notes by reason of his having some connection with Spain
other than:

(i) the mere holding of Notes; or

(ii) the receipt of any payment in respect of Notes;

(b) where taxes are imposed by the Kingdom of Spain (or any political subdivision thereof or any
authority or agency therein or thereof having power to tax) that are (i) any estate, inheritance, gift,
sales, transfer, personal property or similar taxes or (ii) solely due to the appointment by any Holder,
or any person through which such Holder holds such Note, of a custodian, collection agent, person
or entity acting on its behalf or similar person in relation to such Note; or

(c) to, or to a third party on behalf of, a Holder who is an individual resident for tax purposes in the
Kingdom of Spain (or any political subdivision or any authority thereof or therein having power to
tax); or

(d) to, or to a third party on behalf of, a Holder in respect of whose Notes the Bank (or an agent acting
on behalf of the Bank) has not received such information as it may be required to obtain in order to
comply with Spanish tax reporting requirements, as may be necessary to allow payments on such
Notes to be made free and clear of withholding tax or deduction on account of any taxes imposed
by Spain, including when the Bank (or an agent acting on behalf of the Bank) does not receive a
duly executed and completed certificate, pursuant to Law 10/2014 and Royal Decree 1065/2007 of
27 July, as amended by Royal Decree 1145/2011 of 29 July, and any implementing legislation or
regulation.

Notwithstanding any other provision of these Conditions, any amounts to be paid by the Bank on the Notes will
be paid net of any deduction or withholding imposed or required pursuant to an agreement described in Section

A46786082

50


-----

1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or otherwise imposed pursuant

such obligation and/or the delivery of such notice. Any costs and expenses incurred by the
relevant Holders as a result of, in connection with or related to the convening by them of a
meeting of the Holders in such circumstances shall be for the account of the Bank and shall be

Holders upon presentation of receipts, invoices or other documentary evidence of such costs.

resolution shall be conclusive evidence that the circumstances justify its passing. Notice of the
result of voting on any resolution duly considered by the Holders shall be published in accordance

### DESCRIPTION OF THE ISSUER

 History and development

Unicaja Banco is a Spanish public limited company (sociedad anónima) incorporated under the laws of Spain
with the status of a bank. As a financial institution, the Issuer is also subject to special banking legislation and
related regulations in respect of the management, supervision and solvency of credit institutions, in particular,
Law 10/2014 and Royal Decree 84/2015, of 13 February, which implements Law 10/2014 (Real Decreto
_84/2015, de 13 de febrero, por el que se desarrolla la Ley 10/2014, de 26 de junio, de ordenación, supervisión_
_y solvencia de entidades de crédito), and is subject to the supervision, control and regulation of the Bank of_
Spain (Banco de España) and the ECB under the supervision system created by the SSM.

Unicaja Banco is also subject to the Spanish Companies Law (Texto refundido de la Ley de Sociedades de
_Capital aprobado por el Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2010, de 2 de julio) and the Spanish Securities Market Law,_
Royal Decree 217/2008, of 15 February, on the legal regime for investment services companies and other
entities providing investment services (Real Decreto 217/2008, de 15 de febrero, sobre el régimen jurídico de
_las empresas de servicios de inversión y de las demás entidades que prestan servicios de inversión) and further_
implementing legislation.

The Issuer was incorporated on 1 December 2011 for an indefinite term by means of the public deed executed
before the Notary Public of Málaga Mr. Federico Pérez Padilla García, under number 7,088 of his records, and
is registered with the Commercial Registry of Málaga, in volume 4952, book 3859, section 8, page no. 111580,
sheet 1. In addition, the Issuer is registered with the Register of Banks and Bankers of the Bank of Spain, under
number 2103. The Bank’s tax identification number is A-93139053 and its LEI code is
5493007SJLLCTM6J6M37.

The legal name of the Issuer is Unicaja Banco, S.A. The Group operates under the commercial name “Unicaja
Banco”.

The Issuer has its registered office in Avenida de Andalucía 10-12, 29007, Málaga, Spain. Its telephone number
is +34952138000 and its corporate website is “www.unicajabanco.com” (the information on the corporate
website of the Issuer does not form part of the Prospectus unless that information is incorporated by reference
into the Prospectus).

Unicaja Banco’s corporate purpose consists of all types of general banking activities, transactions, actions,
contracts and services including those that are directly or indirectly related or are supplementary to them
provided they are permitted or not prohibited by law. Its corporate purpose also includes the rendering of
investment and other auxiliary services, as well as the rendering of insurance agency activities, as an exclusive
or associated operator, but not simultaneously.

The history of the Issuer spans over more than 130 years, with the foundation of Caja de Ahorros y Monte de
Piedad de Cádiz in 1884 as a starting point. Subsequently, Monte de Piedad y Caja de Ahorros de Almería, Caja
de Ahorros y Préstamos de Antequera, Monte de Piedad y Caja de Ahorros de Ronda and Caja de Ahorros
Provincial de Málaga were created between 1900 and 1949. Those savings banks were founded with the aim of
stimulating the economies of their regions, with a special focus on the agricultural, fishing and tourist sectors
as well as retail mortgages. Additionally, they were committed to pursuing social welfare projects aimed at
developing their regions. In 1991, Monte de Piedad y Caja de Ahorros de Ronda, Cádiz, Almería, Málaga y
Antequera (“Unicaja”) was founded as a result of a five-way merger of these Spanish local savings banks.

In the 1990s, while the largest Spanish commercial banks focused on their international expansion, savings
banks significantly expanded across the country pursuant to Royal Decree 1582/1988, of 29 December, on
expansion of deposit entities (Real Decreto 1582/1988 de 29 de diciembre, de modificación del Real Decreto
_1370/1985, en materia de expansión de entidades de depósito) which allowed savings banks to open branches_

-----

beyond their historical home territories. In this context, Unicaja maintained a prudent and focused growth
strategy avoiding aggressively entering new markets. In 2010, Caja Provincial de Ahorros de Jaén, the leading
entity in its province, merged into Unicaja.

In December 2011, pursuant to the enactment of Royal Decree-Law 11/2010, of 9 July, on governing bodies
and other aspects of the legal regime for savings banks (Real Decreto-ley 11/2010, de 9 de julio, de órganos de
_gobierno y otros aspectos del régimen jurídico de las cajas de ahorros), which allowed Spanish savings banks_
to indirectly conduct financial activities through commercial banks, Unicaja segregated and transferred all of
its banking activities to a newly-created public limited company (sociedad anónima) named Unicaja Banco,
S.A.U.

In October 2014, Unicaja was transformed into a banking foundation (Fundación Bancaria Unicaja, the
“Unicaja Banking Foundation”) pursuant to Law 26/2013, of 27 December, on savings banks and banking
foundations (Ley 26/2013, de 27 de diciembre, de cajas de ahorros y fundaciones bancarias). Since then, the
Unicaja Banking Foundation has been and continues to be the Issuer’s principal shareholder, with a 30.24%
shareholding as of the date of this Prospectus. The Unicaja Banking Foundation manages the budget of the
Social Welfare Fund (Obra Social) activities in Andalucía. Additionally, the Unicaja Banking Foundation holds
the rights to the “Unicaja” brand and allows Unicaja Banco the use of such brand. The management of the
Unicaja Banking Foundation’s stake in the Group is regulated by the Unicaja Banking Foundation’s Protocol
(Protocolo de gestión de la participación financiera de la Fundación Bancaria Unicaja en Unicaja Banco) (the
“Unicaja Banking Foundation’s Protocol”), prepared by the governing body (Patronato) of the Unicaja
Banking Foundation and approved by the Bank of Spain, which mainly addresses general aims and guidelines,
brand utilization, the appointment of the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer, conflicts of interests
and intra-group services.

### Merger by absorption of EspañaDuero by Unicaja Banco 

On 28 March 2014, Unicaja Banco acquired control of Banco de Caja de España de Inversiones, Salamanca y
Soria, S.A. (“EspañaDuero”) through an exchange offer of shares, mandatory contingent convertible bonds
and perpetual contingent convertible bonds in Unicaja Banco, to be subscribed for by holders of shares and
mandatory contingent convertible bonds in EspañaDuero. The acquisition was framed by the term sheet for
EspañaDuero’s restructuring plan. The prospectus in relation to the offer was approved by the CNMV on 26
November 2013.

After all the commitments in EspañaDuero’s restructuring plan were fulfilled and, in particular, the repayment,
on 31 August 2017, of the assistance received and repayable, on 21 September 2018 the merger by absorption
of EspañaDuero by Unicaja Banco took place.

The two structures were then fully integrated and combined, which was the culmination of the process of
merging the two institutions which began through the acquisition of EspañaDuero by the Group in 2014.

### Admission to trading of Unicaja Banco

In the framework of the bid for EspañaDuero, Unicaja Banco announced its intention to apply for the admission
to trading of its ordinary shares to the Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia stock exchanges (the “Spanish
**Stock Exchanges”) and quoted on the Automated Quotation System (Sistema de Interconexión Bursátil,**
_S.I.B.E.)._

Within the bookbuilding process with domestic and international investors, the demand for the shares was fully
covered (in the initial amount and for the shares corresponding to the green-shoe option) and on 29 June 2017
the Issuer carried out an issue of new shares for a nominal amount of €625 million and the Bank’s shares were
admitted to trading on the Spanish Stock Exchanges on 30 June 2017.

On 25 July 2017, Unicaja Banco carried out the share capital increase corresponding to the green-shoe option
granted to the IPO stabilisation agent. As a result, Unicaja Banco had a share capital for a total of
€1,610,302,121 divided into 1,610,302,121 registered shares each with a nominal value of one euro.

### Recent developments

 Merger by absorption of Liberbank by Unicaja Banco

On 29 December 2020, the Boards of Directors of Unicaja Banco and Liberbank approved the joint merger plan
for the merger of Liberbank (absorbed company) into Unicaja Banco (absorbing company).

held in March 2021 by more than 99% of share capital in both cases, with a quorum of more than 74.7% in the
case of Unicaja Banco, and more than 55.8% in the case of Liberbank.

After obtaining the required authorisations, the Merger was registered with the Commercial Registry of Málaga
on 30 July 2021 and, thus, became effective as of that date, and Unicaja Banco acquired, by universal
succession, all the rights and obligations of Liberbank. As a result thereof, this was the last day Liberbank’s
shares were traded on Spanish Stock Exchanges before being exchanged for Unicaja Banco shares.

Unicaja Banco covered the Merger exchange ratio by delivering to Liberbank’s shareholders one new-issue
ordinary share for every 2.7705 shares of Liberbank with a nominal value of one euro. Unicaja Banco increased
its share capital by issuing 1,075,072,455 ordinary shares, with a nominal value of one euro each, for
distribution to Liberbank’s shareholders, that started trading on the Spanish Stock Exchanges on 2 August 2021.
As a result thereof, Unicaja Banco’s share capital was represented by 2,654,833,479 shares, each of a nominal
value of one euro, belonging to the same class and series.

### Issue of additional tier 1 preferred securities

On 18 November 2021, Unicaja Banco issued a total amount €500 million of perpetual non-cumulative
additional tier 1 preferred securities in denominations of €200,000 each. The preferred securities were issued at
par and their remuneration, whose payment is subject to certain conditions and to the discretion of Unicaja
Banco, was set at 4.875% per annum (payable quarterly) for the period commencing on (and including) the
issue date and ending on (but excluding) 18 May 2027, being reviewed thereafter every five years by applying
a margin of 5.020% per annum on the 5-year Mid-Swap Rate.

### Issue of senior preferred notes

On 1 December 2021, Unicaja Banco issued a total amount €600 million of fixed rate reset senior preferred
notes due 1 December 2026 in denominations of €100,000 each (the “Senior Preferred Notes”). The notes
were issued at 99.941% of their principal amount and bear interest on their outstanding principal amount at a
fixed rate of 1.00% per annum from (and including) the issue date to (but excluding) 1 December 2025 and
from (and including) 1 December 2025 until their final redemption on 1 December 2026 at a rate corresponding
to the sum of the 1-year mid swap rate plus a margin of 1.15%.

On 20 December 2021, Unicaja Banco issued an additional €60 million of fixed rate reset senior preferred notes
due 1 December 2026 (the “Additional Senior Preferred Notes”), to be consolidated and form a single series
with the Senior Preferred Notes in accordance with condition 11 (Further Issues) of the terms and conditions
of the Senior Preferred Notes. The terms and conditions of the Additional Senior Preferred Notes are the same

   - _Secured loans_

Secured loans are based on a security interest, whereby the loan is guaranteed by cash, valuables or
assets other than real property. The terms and interest provisions of secured loans depend on the type of
the security interest, the amount of the loan and the term of the loan. The typical term for these operations
is up to three years.

The Group provides credit facility products to companies who wish to have access to short-term liquidity
and pay interest on the basis of available capital. The Group tailors the credit facility products to the
Group’s customers’ business needs, which vary based on the customers’ particular industry. The typical
term for these transactions is up to one year, with the possibility of renewal in certain cases.

   - _Term deposits_

These deposits, in euro or other currencies and made for a determined term, offer an interest-based
income that varies depending on the term. The amount of the deposit together with the term, which can
be from one day to five years or longer, affects the amount of interest received by the customer on the

interest, payment at the end of the term or connected to certain market indices. The customer can choose

### Legal and arbitration proceedings

The Group has been and is involved in disputes and litigation related to the business. In particular, the Group is

Group’s mortgage agreements (known as “floor clauses”), which set a minimum interest rate payable by
borrowers to the lenders, regardless of the applicable benchmark rate. Currently, the Group does not include
floor clauses in its mortgage agreements. However, borrowers have challenged the validity of such clauses in
recent years on various grounds. EU and Spanish courts have rendered various judgments, directed both at
specific financial institutions (including the Group) and the financial sector in general, declaring certain clauses
that set minimum interest rates to be invalid on the basis of a lack of transparency at the time such mortgages
were sold to customers or other reasons, which may materially affect the Group.

Unicaja Banco is taking different judicial and extra judicial actions based on negotiations with clients who are
filing claims in relation to these clauses and, as a consequence, the impact of such judicial actions has been
reduced. In fact, the number of lawsuits notified on this matter during the first semester of 2019 (6,002),
compared to those notified in the same period for the year 2021 (2,492), shows an overall reduction of more
than 58%.

On 20 January 2017, the Spanish Government approved Royal Decree Law 1/2017 (“RDL 1/2017”), which
encourages out-of-court settlements between financial institutions and those borrowers affected by such clauses,
and aims to avoid overloading the Spanish Courts with these claims by establishing measures that incentivize
a negotiation with the borrowers without going to court. However, although financial institutions are obliged to
contact affected customers, letting them know of the existence of the relevant clauses in their documentation,
there is no obligation for the parties to reach an agreement, in which case the borrowers are still able to file
claims against the financial institutions. The Group has implemented the procedures set out in the RDL 1/2017
by creating a specific unit as part of its Customer Service Care (Departamento de Atención al Cliente) to inform
affected borrowers of the existence of these procedures, address any claims that may be brought by them and,
if appropriate, negotiate with them on a case by case basis. As well as judicial procedures, the claims filed in
accordance with RDL 1/2017 have decreased noticeably. They were approximately 50% less claims during the
first semester of 2021 than in the same period of 2018.

Notwithstanding the above, new legal claims have been filed in Spain concerning the validity of the settlement
agreements on floor clauses that many financial institutions (including Unicaja Banco) have reached with their
clients. In this regard, the CJEU issued a decision on 9 July 2020 on Case C452/18 which analysed whether a
settlement or the amendment agreement executed by and between a professional and a consumer regarding
floor clauses and the waiver to bring legal actions contained in such agreements were valid. According to the
CJEU:

(a) The consumer may enter into an agreement with the lender that confirms the validity of the floor
clause and by which he/she waives legal actions regarding such clause provided that, at the time of

A46786082

-----

the waiver, the consumer was aware of the non-binding nature of that clause and the consequences
it entails;

(b) The national courts will need to determine, on a case-by-case basis, if there has been a real
negotiation between the relevant lender and the consumer. Indications by the consumer, in his/her
own handwriting, that he/she understood the mechanism of the floor clause does not in itself lead
to the conclusion that this clause was individually negotiated and that the consumer was able to
influence its content; and

(c) The national courts will need to examine whether or not the consumer could understand the
financial consequences of the agreement entered into with the lender. For the purposes of
transparency, the pre-contractual information should include information on the past development
of the index so that the consumer is aware, through past fluctuations, of the eventuality that he/she
cannot benefit from lower rates due to the amended floor clause. The consumer may validly waive
the right to have the original floor clause declared unfair, provided that this waiver is made by the
consumer with free and informed consent. However, the consumer cannot validly waive future legal
actions regarding the amended floor clause in respect of disputes which may arise in the future.

As of 30 September 2021, the provisions considered necessary to cover potential asset impairments and deal
with the risks and contingencies that may impact the Group were in place. In this regard, the Group has
recognised an accounting provision of €186 million (€123 million and €177 million as of 31 December 2020
and 31 December 2019, respectively).

In addition, Liberbank, the absorbed company in the Merger, has recognised the necessary accounting
provisions totalling €18.75 million to cover potential asset impairments and deal with the risks and
contingencies that may arise due to floor clauses proceedings as of 31 December 2020 (€27.75 million as of 31
December 2019).

_IRPH potential litigation_

A preliminary ruling was filed before the CJEU which challenges the validity, due to alleged lack of
transparency, of mortgage loan agreements subject to the IRPH. This claim was made after the ruling of the
Spanish Supreme Court in December 2017, which confirmed that it was not possible to determine the lack of
transparency in the interest rate because of its reference to one or another official index, and therefore its
unfairness.

The legal matter under debate is, among others, whether the transparency test based on Council Directive
93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts (“Directive 93/13/EEC”), when the borrower
is a consumer.

Based on the existence of the judgment of the Supreme Court dated 14 December 2017, the fact that the IRPH
is an official benchmark rate published and managed by the Bank of Spain, the existence of case law
(jurisprudencia) of the CJEU which confirms the transparency of contracts referenced to other official
benchmark rates, and the existence of an annual percentage rate (or APR, “T.A.E.” in Spain) indicator, which
must be mandatorily informed to consumers, and which allows for the comprehension of the economic burden
and the comparison of different mortgage offers (whatever the benchmark rate index applied is), the Bank
considers that compliance with the transparency test under Directive 93/13/EEC should not be questioned.

On 10 September 2019, the Advocate General issued its opinion in relation to this matter (the “Advocate
**General’s Opinion”), according to which (i) Directive 93/13/EEC is applicable to the matter of reference and**
(ii) the national judge should be the competent authority to monitor the transparency of the disputed clause and
verify whether the contract sets out the method of calculating the interest rate transparently and whether this
contract meets all the information requirements envisaged in the national regulations.

A46786082

98


-----

The Advocate General’s Opinion does not consider the IRPH or the clause which incorporates it in the relevant
loan agreements to be, per se, abusive or null.

On 3 March 2020, the CJEU issued a ruling confirming the Advocate General’s Opinion in connection with this
case (Case C-125/18) regarding the transparency and unfairness of a clause governing a floating interest rate
indexed to IRPH included in a mortgage loan agreement granted to a consumer. The CJEU concluded that IRPH
index floating interest clauses cannot be considered abusive per se but they fall under the transparency control
requirements set out in Directive 93/13/EEC. As a consequence, Spanish courts will carry out this control in
order to determine if the relevant clause included in the agreement lacks transparency and if, in addition, is
ultimately unfair and consequently void. That control has to be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into
account the circumstances at the time when the relevant mortgage loan was granted.

Spanish courts of first instance have generally ruled in favour of consumers applying the CJEU decision and
have declared that IRPH clauses are (in the relevant cases examined), null and void, substituting it for
EURIBOR (which is currently lower) and, in certain decisions, have ordered the delivery of the excess (i.e. the
difference between the interest charged at IRPH and the interest that would have been payable should the
EURIBOR have applied since inception) to the debtors. Some provincial courts (“Provincial Audiences”) have
also rule against the credit entity, but rather than applying EURIBOR they have applied the index named “IRPH
Entidades” (e.g. Valencia Provincial Audience’s ruling dated 1 June 2020 or Tarragona Provincial Audience’s
ruling dated 11 March 2020). However, other Provincial Audiences such as the Barcelona Provincial Audience
(Section 15th ), based on the abovementioned Spanish Supreme Court ruling (dated 14 December 2017), have
ruled in favour of credit entities regarding clauses which referred the IRPH index but were found to be
transparent to the extent that an average consumer would have easy access to the evolution of the different
indexes, either through the information disseminated by the Bank of Spain (Banco de España), or through the
monthly publication of these indexes in the Spanish Official Gazette (BOE), even in those cases where there is
no proof of the delivery of the brochure (Barcelona Provincial Audience decision of 24 April 2020).

Notwithstanding the above, four Spanish Supreme Court rulings regarding references to the IRPH index which
were made public on 13 November 2020 (numbered 595/2020, 596/2020, 597/2020 and 598/2020) have
favoured the banks. While declaring that the IRPH clauses lacked transparency on the grounds that the
mortgagor was not informed of the performance of the IRPH index in the two years prior to taking out the loan,
the Supreme Court confirmed that such clauses are to be deemed non-abusive for the following reasons: (i)
IRPH clauses are not able to be easily rigged in favour of the lender (in fact, IRPH is controlled by the public
administration, whereas EURIBOR is calculated by a private entity), (ii) a significant imbalance to the
consumer’s detriment cannot be derived from the mere evolution of the index during the duration of the loan,
even if unfavourable to the consumer, and (iii) the use of an official index does not contravene the good faith
principle. Thus, following the recent rulings by the Spanish Supreme Court, the risk of the application of the
IRPH being declared unfair is currently lower and is limited to potential decisions by certain lower courts
(although there is currently a further Supreme Court ruling pending). However, there are two questions that
have been posed by first instance courts before the CJEU which could potentially change the Spanish Supreme
Court doctrine.

Thus, following the recent rulings by the Spanish Supreme Court, the risk of the application of the IRPH being
declared unfair is currently lower and the Group doesn’t expect contingencies related to this matter.

_Revolving cards_

On 4 March 2020, Spanish Supreme Court issued a judgement dismissing a bank’s appeal (recurso de casación)
against a ruling that had declared a revolving credit agreement void due to usurious interest.

After analysing the case law, as of 30 September 2021 and as of 31 December 2020, the Group doesn’t expect
contingencies related to claims regarding this matter.

A46786082

99


-----

However, Liberbank, has included provisions in relation to this subject. In this sense, it has recognised
provisions as of 31 December 2020 totalling €1.26 million for obligations concerning the usurious interest rate
of revolving credit agreements.

_Interest calculation formula used in mortgage transactions_

The validity of one of the formulas used by the Group for calculating interest in mortgage agreements has been
challenged by a limited number of lawsuits, on the basis that the numerator of the interest calculation formula
fraction is calculated in natural days, and the denominator of the fraction is calculated in business days.

In order to avoid further claims from clients, Unicaja Banco has been progressively reducing the use of this
formula on the occasion of the periodic interest review applicable to each loan agreement.

_Early termination of mortgages_

On 26 March 2019, the CJEU issued the long-expected judgment regarding early termination clauses contained
in mortgage loans to consumers.

The CJEU judgment confirmed the unfairness of this sort of clause that includes any breach as a termination
event and prohibits to delete those sections of the clause that may be considered null in order to seek partial
validity thereof. However, the CJEU opened the door to applying the rule of the three unpaid monthly repayment
amounts to terminate the affected agreements, if the declaration of unfairness entails an invalidity of the entire
mortgage loan.

The legal scenario changed with enactment of Law 5/2019 on Real Estate Credit Contracts (Ley de Contratos
_de Crédito Inmobiliario) (the “Real Estate Credit Contract Law”), which came into force on 16 June 2019._
The new regulation on accelerated repayment modifies Article 693 of Spanish Law 1/2000, of 7 January, on
Civil Procedure (Ley 1/2000, de 7 de enero, de Enjuiciamiento Civil) and applies to loan agreements signed
prior to the entry into force of the Real Estate Credit Contract Law that include an acceleration clause unless:
(i) the debtor claims that applying the clause is more favourable to him or her; or (ii) the clause was triggered
by the lender prior to the entry into force of the Law (regardless of whether or not, as a result, enforcement
proceedings were initiated).

Article 24 of the Real Estate Credit Contract Law allows the lender to accelerate consumer loan agreements (i)
after a payment default equal to 3% of the total loan amount or 12 monthly instalments if the default occurs in
the first half of the term of the loan or (ii) after a payment default equal to 7% of the total loan amount or 15
monthly instalments if the default occurs in the second half of the term of the loan.

Following the CJEU judgement of March 2019 declaring the invalidity of this clause and deferring to the
Spanish courts to determine the effects of such invalidity, on 11 September 2019, the Spanish Supreme Court
ruled that: (i) in relation to the loans subject to legal proceedings that had been declared due prior to 15 March
2013, the proceedings should terminate and the Bank should file a new enforcement claim; (ii) in relation to
the loans subject to legal proceedings that had been declared due after 15 March 2013, the proceedings should
continue if the relevant judge determined that the breach was material with regards to the amount and the term
of the loan. In the opposite case, the proceedings should terminate and the Bank should file a new enforcement
claim; (iii) in relation to loans which had been declared due in accordance with Real Estate Credit Contract
Law the proceedings should continue; and (iv) in the future, the Bank can commence enforcement actions in
relation to the loans which are declared due in accordance with Real Estate Credit Contract Law, without the
declaration of invalidity of the clause affecting such actions.

_Claims in relation to the expenses relating to the formalization of mortgages_

Certain rulings enacted by the Spanish Supreme Court in 2015 and 2017 considered unfair certain clauses which
allocated to the borrowers certain expenses in connection with the granting and registration of the mortgage
deeds (including notarial and registration fees), taxes derived from the granting of the mortgage deeds and/or

A46786082

100


-----

any costs and expenses related to the recovery of any due amount under the mortgage loans (including those
derived from the foreclosure of the mortgages).

While courts have consistently considered that clauses establishing that all costs shall be borne by the borrowers
were unfair (and, on such basis, borrowers started to claim reimbursement from the banks of certain costs linked
to the granting of the mortgage loans such as the notarial, Land Registry and agency fees), there has been some
debate regarding taxes associated to mortgage loans (i.e. stamp duty).

In this regard, the Spanish Supreme Court rendered several decisions establishing that the clause which provided
that those taxes were to be borne by the borrower should not be deemed as an unfair clause per se.

However, on 10 October 2018 the Spanish Supreme Court issued a ruling (i) establishing that the lenders (and
not the borrowers) would be liable for the payment of those taxes, and (ii) declaring article 68.2 of the Stamp
Duty Regulation (passed by Royal Decree 828/1995, of 25 May), which expressly established that the borrower
was liable to pay stamp duty), null and void as contrary to that new interpretation.

But on 9 November 2018 the Spanish Supreme Court changed such criterion and resolved that borrowers were
liable to pay the stamp duty. Immediately afterwards, the Spanish Government clarified the legislative
framework and enacted Royal Decree-Law 17/2018, which provided that the lender must be the taxpayer.

On 23 January 2019, the Spanish Supreme Court issued a new ruling confirming that consumers would have to
be reimbursed by lenders the notarial, Land registry and agency fees, but not the stamp duty. Notwithstanding
this, this ruling does not apply to mortgage loans entered into after the entry into force of Royal Decree-Law
17/2018 (i.e. 10 November 2018). The Spanish Supreme Court has also confirmed that, while notarial fees and
agency fees have to be shared between the lender and the borrower (i.e. the lender should only reimburse 50
per cent. thereof), registry fees have to be paid in full by the lender (i.e. it should reimburse 100 per cent. of
these fees).

Additionally, the Real Estate Credit Contract Law regulates costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
origination of mortgage loans. The Real Estate Credit Contract Law applies to loans secured with mortgages
over residential real estate properties, which are originated, amended or subrogated after 16 June 2019.
According to the Real Estate Credit Contract Law (i) valuation costs are to be paid by the borrower, (ii) agency
fees by the lender, (iii) notarial costs relating to the loan deed by the lender, (iv) registration costs by the lender,
and (v) stamp duty costs by the taxpayer (i.e. the lender).

Notwithstanding the above, before the Real Estate Credit Contract Law was passed, there was no legal provision
regulating management costs. The Spanish Supreme Court ruling 555/2020, of 26 October 2020, followed the
CJEU’s ruling of 16 July 2020 stating that, if the specific clause regulating management costs is declared to be
unfair, in the absence of any supplementary legal regime, those costs cannot be borne by the borrower and must
be paid in full by the lender. This Supreme Court ruling has established that “in the absence of a national rule
which applies in case there is a lack of an agreement negotiated among the parties imposing on the borrower
the payment of all or part of those expenses, the borrower could not be denied the return of the amounts paid
under the clause that has been declared unfair”. The Spanish Supreme Court ruling 61/2021, of 27 January
2021, has confirmed the aforementioned position. However, the novelty of this ruling is that it applies the above
conclusion to the appraisal costs (but only when the Real Estate Credit Contract Law is not applicable, because
if it does apply, article 14.1.e) of the above regulation will allocate appraisal costs to the borrower).

Unicaja Banco, as the rest of the credit entities in the Spanish sector, has experienced an increase in the litigation
related to this matter and is taking action to reach agreements with its clients to avoid further judicial processes.

As of the date of this Prospectus, the Group is under 17,500 legal proceedings related to this matter. Unicaja
Banco has recognized provisions covering obligations that may arise from such ongoing legal proceedings,

A46786082

totaling €37 million as of 30 September 2021 (as of 31 December 2020, provisions related to claims regarding
this matter for both the Group and Liberbank, were not material.).

_Law 57/1968, of 27 July, on the collection of advance amounts in the construction and sale of housing_

Although Law 57/1968 was repealed by Law 38/1999, of 5 November, on building construction (Ley 38/1999,
_de 5 de noviembre, de ordenación de la edificación), it is still applicable to all purchases of housing made until_
1 January 2016. This law set forth the express obligation for property developers to pay the amounts received
from home buyers into a special account, as well as to grant in favor of such buyers a guarantee for the
repayment of such amounts. The judgment of the Spanish Supreme Court dated 21 December 2015 extended
the responsibility for repayment of such amounts to the financing credit institutions, and for the amounts paid
by the home buyers, irrespective of whether or not it had issued a guarantee that such amounts would be repaid.

This law has led to some claims against credit institutions for the amounts delivered by individuals to developers
on account of the purchase of housing, when said payments had been channeled through a credit institution. As
at 30 September 2021, the estimate of the maximum amount claimed was €51 million (€37.7 million, €13.6
million in the case of Liberbank, as at 31 December 2020).

### Financial information as of and for the nine months ended 30 September 2021 and 2020

The table below includes the consolidated balance sheets of the Group as of 30 September 2021 and 31
December 2020 extracted from the 2021 Third Quarter Financial Report. Given that the Merger was
materialised on 31 July 2021 for accounting purposes, the consolidated balance sheet of the Group as of 30
September 2021 includes Liberbank’s assets and liabilities and the results generated by Liberbank in August
and September of 2021 and therefore the financial information as of 30 September 2021 is not comparable with
the financial information as of 31 December 2020:

The table below includes the consolidated income statements of the Group for the nine months ended 30
September 2021 and 2020. Given that the Merger was materialised on 31 July 2021 for accounting purposes,
the consolidated income statement of the Group for the nine months ended 30 September 2021 includes the
results generated by Liberbank in August and September of 2021 and therefore the financial information for the
nine months ended 30 September 2021 is not comparable with the financial information for the nine months
ended 30 September 2020:

### Alternative Performance Measures 

This Prospectus (and the documents incorporated by reference in this Prospectus) contains certain management
measures of performance or APMs, which are used by management to evaluate the Group’s overall performance
or liquidity. These measures are used in the Bank’s planning, operational and financial decision-making and are
commonly used in the finance sector as indicators to monitor institutions’ assets, liabilities and
economic/financial positions.

These APMs are not audited, reviewed or subject to review by the Issuer’s auditors and are not measures
required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS-EU. Many of these APMs are based on the Issuer’s internal
estimates, assumptions and calculations. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
these APMs.

Furthermore, these APMs, as used by the Issuer, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used
by other companies. Investors should not consider such APMs in isolation, as alternatives to the information
calculated in accordance with IFRS-EU, as indications of operating performance or as measures of the Group’s
profitability or liquidity. Such APMs must be considered only in addition to, and not as a substitute for or
superior to, financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS-EU and investors are advised to review
these APMs in conjunction with the audited consolidated annual accounts incorporated by reference in this
Prospectus.

The Bank believes that the description of these APMs in this Prospectus follows and complies with the “ESMA
Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures” dated 5 October 2015.

In respect of the Group, the 2021 Third Quarter Financial Report and Unicaja Banco’s management report in
respect of the 2020 Consolidated Annual Accounts (the “2020 Management Report”), both incorporated by
reference to this Prospectus, contain a list of part of the APMs corresponding to Unicaja Banco used in this
Prospectus, along with a reconciliation between them and the IFRS indicators or measures presented in the
2021 Third Quarter Financial Report, the 2020 Consolidated Annual Accounts and the 2019 Consolidated
Annual Accounts, as applicable. In respect of Liberbank, the Liberbank 2020 Consolidated Annual Accounts,
contain a list of part of the APMs corresponding to Liberbank used in this Prospectus, along with a reconciliation

amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (as amended, “CRR I”) and any CRD IV Implementing Measures (as
this term is defined in the Conditions of the Notes, and together with CRR I and the CRD IV Directive, “CRD
**IV”). The implementation of the CRD IV Directive in Spain took place through Royal Decree-Law 14/2013,**
of 29 November, on urgent measures to adapt Spanish law to EU regulations on the subject of supervision and
solvency of financial entities, Law 10/2014, of 26 June, on regulation, supervision and solvency of credit
institutions (“Law 10/2014”), Royal Decree 84/2015, of 13 February, implementing Law 10/2014 (the “Royal
**Decree 84/2015”) and Bank of Spain Circulars 2/2014, of 31 January, and 2/2016, of 2 February, to credit**
entities, on supervision and solvency, which completes the adaptation of Spanish law to CRR I and CRD IV
Directive (the “Bank of Spain Circular 2/2016”).

Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 establishing a framework
for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms (as amended, the “BRRD”), that has
been implemented in Spain through Law 11/2015 and Royal Decree 1012/2015, also establishes certain
requirements in terms of MREL.

On 23 November 2016, the European Commission presented a comprehensive package of reforms amending
CRR I, the CRD IV Directive, BRRD and Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 15 July 2014 establishing uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of credit
institutions and certain investment firms (“the **SRM Regulation”). On 14 May 2019 the text was formally**
approved by the Council of the European Union. On 7 June 2019 the following regulations were published: (i)
Directive (EU) 2019/878 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 (as amended, replaced
or supplemented from time to time, the “CRD V Directive”) amending the CRD IV Directive, (ii) Directive
(EU) 2019/879 of the European Parliament and of the European Council of 20 May 2019 (as amended, replaced
or supplemented from time to time, “BRRD II”) amending, among other things, the BRRD as regards the lossabsorbing and recapitalisation capacity of credit institutions and investment firms, (iii) Regulation (EU)
2019/876 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 (as amended, replaced or
supplemented from time to time, “CRR II”) amending, among other things, the CRR I as regards the leverage
ratio, the net stable funding ratio, requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities, counterparty credit risk,
market risk, exposures to central counterparties, exposures to collective investment undertakings, large
exposures, and reporting and disclosure requirements, and (iv) Regulation (EU) 2019/877 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 (as amended, replaced or supplemented from time to time, the
“SRM Regulation II”) amending the SRM Regulation as regards the loss-absorbing and recapitalisation
capacity of credit institutions and investment firms (the CRD V Directive, BRRD II, CRR II and the SRM
Regulation II, the “EU Banking Reforms”). The EU Banking Reforms entered into force on 27 June 2019 and
apply since 29 December 2020, other than in the case of CRR II where a two-year period was provided for,
subject to certain exceptions.

Most of the provisions of the EU Banking Reforms have started to apply. CRD V Directive and BRRD II have
been partially implemented into Spanish law through Royal Decree-Law 7/2021, of 27 April, (“RDL 7/2021”)
which amended, amongst others, Law 10/2014 and Law 11/2015. Furthermore, Royal Decree 970/2021, of 8
November, generally in force since 10 November 2021, which amended Royal Decree 84/2015, and Circular

5/2021 of the Bank of Spain, of 22 December, which amended the Bank of Spain Circular 2/2016, completed
the implementation into Spanish law of CRD V, and Royal Decree 1041/2021, of 23 November, (“Royal Decree
**1041/2021”), generally in force since 24 November 2021, which amended Royal Decree 1012/2015, completed**
the implementation of BRRD II into Spanish law. Given the recent implementation of the CRD V Directive and
the BRRD II there is uncertainty as to how the EU Banking Reforms will be applied by the relevant authorities.

The package of reforms presented by the European Commission on 23 November 2016 included a proposal to
create a new asset class of “non preferred” senior debt. On 27 December 2017, Directive 2017/2399 amending
Directive 2014/59/EU as regards the ranking of unsecured debt instruments in insolvency hierarchy was
published in the Official Journal of the European Union. Before that, Royal Decree-Law 11/2017, of 23 June,
approving urgent measures on financial matters created in Spain the new asset class of senior non preferred
debt.

In addition, in reaction to the COVID-19 outbreak, in June 2020 the European Parliament and the Council of
the European Union adopted a banking package (the "COVID-19 Banking Package") that provides targeted
and exceptional legislative changes to CRR II intended to allow credit institutions to fully play their role in
managing the economic shock that stems from the COVID-19 pandemic by fostering credit flows. The targeted
amendments concern, among others: (i) the introduction in advance of some capital relief measures for banks
under CRR II; (ii) changes to the calculation of the leverage ratio; and (iii) changes to the minimum amount of
capital that banks are required to hold for NPLs under the “prudential backstop”

Moreover, on 26 January 2021, the European Commission launched a targeted public consultation on technical
aspects on a new review of BRRD (“BRRD III”), the SRM Regulation (“SRM Regulation III”), and Directive
2014/49/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on deposit guarantee schemes
(“DGSD II”). The consultation was open until 20 April 2021 and was split into two main sections: a section
covering the general objectives of the review focus, and a section seeking technical feedback on stakeholders
experience with the current framework and the need for changes in the future framework, notably on (i)
resolution, liquidation and other available measures to handle banking crises, (ii) level of harmonisation of
creditor hierarchy in the EU and impact on no creditor worse-off principle, and (iii) depositor insurance. No
agreement was reached on potential changes during the public consultation, and therefore further work will be
needed and legislative proposals on this are only expected during 2022.

Additionally, on 27 October 2021, the European Commission published legislative proposals amending CRR I
and the CRD IV Directive, as well as a separate legislative proposal amending CRR I and BRRD in the area of
resolution. In particular, these legislative proposals are the following: (i) Directive of the European Parliament
and of the Council amending CRD IV Directive as regards supervisory powers, sanctions, third-country
branches, and environmental, social and governance risks, and amending BRRD; (ii) Regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council and its annex amending CRR I as regards requirements for credit risk,
credit valuation adjustment risk, operational risk, market risk and the output floor; and (iii) Regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending CRR I and BRRD as regards the prudential treatment of
global systemically important institution groups with a multiple point of entry resolution strategy and a
methodology for the indirect subscription of instruments eligible for meeting the minimum requirement for own
funds and eligible liabilities. These legislative proposals will need to follow the ordinary legislative procedure
to become binding EU law. The average length of the ordinary legislative procedure is of around 18 months.
However, the timing for the final implementation of these legislative proposals is unclear as of the date of this
Prospectus. The final package of new legislation may not include all elements currently set out in the proposal
and new or amended elements may be introduced through the course of the legislative process.

### Capital requirements

Under CRD IV, Unicaja Banco and the Group are required to hold a minimum amount of regulatory capital of
8% of risk-weighted assets (“RWAs”) of which at least 4.5% must be CET1 capital and at least 6% must be
Tier 1 capital (together, the “minimum “Pillar 1” capital requirements”).

Moreover, Article 104 of CRD IV Directive, as implemented in Spain by Article 68 of Law 10/2014 and 94 of
Royal Decree 84/2015, and similarly Article 16 of Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013, of 15 October 2013,
conferring specific tasks on the ECB concerning policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit
institutions (the “SSM Regulation”), also contemplates that in addition to the minimum “Pillar 1” capital
requirements, the supervisory authorities may require further capital to cover other risks. This may result in the
imposition of additional capital requirements on Unicaja Banco and/or the Group pursuant to this “Pillar 2”
framework. Following the introduction of the SSM, the ECB is in charge of assessing additional “Pillar 2”
capital requirements (“P2R”) through the supervisory review and evaluation process (the “SREP”) assessments
to be carried out at least on an annual basis (accordingly requirements may change from year to year).

In addition to the minimum “Pillar 1” capital requirements and the P2R, credit institutions must comply with
the “combined buffer requirement” set out in the CRD IV Directive as implemented in Spain. The “combined
buffer requirement” has introduced up to five new capital buffers to be satisfied with additional CET1 capital:
(i) the capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of RWAs; (ii) the global systemically important institutions (“G**SII”) buffer which shall not be less than 1% of RWAs; (iii) the institution-specific counter-cyclical capital buffer**
(consisting of the weighted average of the counter-cyclical capital buffer rates that apply in the jurisdictions
where the relevant credit exposures are located), which may be as much as 2.5% of RWAs (or higher pursuant
to the competent authority); (iv) the other systemically important institutions (“O-SII”) buffer, which may be
as much as 3% of RWAs (or higher pursuant to the competent authority); and (v) the systemic risk buffer to
prevent systemic or macro prudential risks (to be set by the competent authority).

The Bank has not been classified as G-SII or as O-SII by the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) nor by any
competent authority so, unless otherwise indicated by the FSB or by the Bank of Spain in the future, it is not
required to maintain the G-SII buffer or the O-SII buffer. In addition, the Bank of Spain agreed to maintain the
countercyclical capital buffer applicable to credit exposures in Spain at 0% for the first quarter of 2022
(requirements will be revised each quarter). Some or all of the other buffers may also apply to the Bank from
time to time as determined by the Bank of Spain, the ECB or any other competent authority.

As set out in the “Opinion of the European Banking Authority on the interaction of “Pillar 1”, “Pillar 2” and
combined buffer requirements and restrictions on distributions” published on 16 December 2015, competent
authorities should ensure that the CET1 capital to be taken into account in determining the CET1 capital
available to meet the “combined buffer requirement” for the purposes of the Maximum Distributable Amount
(as defined below) calculation is limited to the amount not used to meet the minimum “Pillar 1” capital
requirements and the P2R of the institution and, accordingly, the “combined buffer requirement” is in addition
to the minimum “Pillar 1” capital requirement and to the P2R, and therefore it would be the first layer of capital
to be eroded pursuant to the applicable stacking order. CRD V Directive clarifies that P2R should be positioned
in the relevant stacking order of own funds requirements above the minimum "Pillar 1" capital requirements
and below the “combined buffer requirement” or the leverage ratio buffer requirement, as relevant. In addition,
CRD V Directive also clarifies that P2R should be set in relation to the specific situation of an institution
excluding macroprudential or systemic risks, but including the risks incurred by individual institutions due to
their activities (including those reflecting the impact of certain economic and market developments on the risk
profile of an individual institution) and it also allows the P2R to be partially covered with Additional Tier 1
Instruments and Tier 2 Instruments.

According to Article 48 of Law 10/2014, Article 73 of Royal Decree 84/2015 and Rule 24 of Bank of Spain
Circular 2/2016, those entities failing to meet the “combined buffer requirement” or making a distribution in
connection with CET1 capital to an extent that would decrease its CET1 capital to a level where the “combined
buffer requirement” is no longer met will be subject to restrictions on (i) distributions relating to CET1 capital,
(ii) payments in respect of variable remuneration or discretionary pension revenues and (iii) distributions
relating to Additional Tier 1 capital instruments, until the maximum distributable amount calculated according
to CRD IV (i.e., the firm’s “distributable profits”, calculated in accordance with CRD IV, multiplied by a factor
dependent on the extent of the shortfall in CET1 capital) (the “Maximum Distributable Amount”) has been
calculated and communicated to the Bank of Spain. Thereafter, any such distributions or payments will be
subject to such Maximum Distributable Amount for entities (a) not meeting the “combined buffer requirement”
or (b) in relation to which the Bank of Spain has adopted any of the measures set forth in Article 68.2 of Law
10/2014 aimed at strengthening own funds or limiting or prohibiting the distribution of dividends.

In accordance with Article 73 of Royal Decree 84/2015 and Rule 24 of the Bank of Spain Circular 2/2016,
restrictions of discretionary payments will be scaled according to the extent of the breach of the “combined
buffer requirement” and calculated as a percentage of the profits of the institution generated since the last annual
decision on the distribution of profits. Such calculation will result in a “Maximum Distributable Amount” in
each relevant period. As an example, the scaling is such that in the bottom quartile of the combined buffer
requirement, no “discretionary payments” will be permitted to be made. As a consequence, in the event of
breach of the “combined buffer requirement” (including where additional capital requirements are imposed that
have the result of increasing the regulatory minimum required under CRD IV) it may be necessary to reduce
discretionary payments (in whole or in part).

In addition, a new Article 16.a) of the BRRD, as recently amended by BRRD II, better clarifies the stacking
order between the “combined buffer requirement” and the MREL requirement. Pursuant to this new provision,
a resolution authority will have the power to prohibit an entity from distributing the “maximum distributable
amount” for own funds and eligible liabilities (calculated in accordance with the new Article 16.a)(4) of the
BRRD) (the “MREL-Maximum Distributable Amount Provision”) through distribution of dividends,
variable remuneration and payments to holders of Additional Tier 1 Instruments, where it meets the “combined
buffer requirement” but fails to meet that “combined buffer requirement” when considered in addition to the
MREL requirements. The referred Article 16.a) of the BRRD includes a potential nine-month grace period
whereby the resolution authority will assess on a monthly basis whether to exercise its powers under the MRELMaximum Distributable Amount Provision before such resolution authority is compelled to exercise its power
under the provisions (subject to certain limited exceptions). The MREL-Maximum Distributable Amount
Provision will be fully applicable from 1 January 2022.

As communicated by the EBA on 1 July 2016 and included in the CRD V Directive, in addition to the minimum
“Pillar 1” capital requirements, the P2R and the “combined buffer requirements”, the supervisor can also set a
“Pillar 2” capital guidance (“P2G”). Thus, SREP decisions of 2016 onwards differentiate between P2R and
P2G. While P2R are binding requirements and breaches can have direct legal consequences for the banks, P2G
is not directly binding and a failure to meet it does not automatically trigger legal action, even though the ECB
expects banks to meet P2G. Following this clarification, the clarifications contained in the “EBA Pillar 2
Roadmap” (April 2017) and the guidelines on the revised common procedures and methodologies for the SREP
and supervisor stress testing published by the EBA on 19 July 2018, banks are expected to meet the P2G with
CET1 capital on top of the level of binding capital requirements (“Pillar 1” capital requirements, P2R and the
“combined buffer requirements”). Under the EU Banking Reforms, the P2G is not relevant for the purposes of
triggering the automatic restriction of the discretionary payments and calculation of the Maximum Distributable
Amount. CRD V provides that when an institution repeatedly fails to meet the P2G, the competent authority
should be entitled to take supervisory measures and, where appropriate, to impose additional own funds
requirements.

In reaction to the COVID-19 outbreak, on 12 March 2020 the ECB announced measures expected to provide
capital relief to banks in support of the economy. These measures include the permission to (i) operate
temporarily below the level of capital defined by P2G, the “capital conservation buffer” and the LCR and (ii)
use capital instruments that do not qualify as CET1 (for example Additional Tier 1 Instruments and Tier 2
Instruments) to meet P2R[40]. Also on that date, the EBA announced its decision to postpone the EU-wide stress
test exercise to 2021 to allow banks to prioritise operational continuity and has announced that flexibility will
guide supervisory approaches.

In addition to the statements on using flexibility within accounting and prudential rules, such as those made by
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”), the EBA and the ECB, amongst others, the European
Commission proposed a few targeted “quick fix” amendments to the EU’s banking prudential rules in order to
maximise the ability of banks to lend and absorb losses related to COVID-19. On 28 June 2020, Regulation
2020/873 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 June amending CRR I and CRR II as regards
certain adjustments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (“Quick Fix”) entered into force setting out
exceptional temporary measures to alleviate the immediate impact of COVID-19-related developments, by
adapting the timeline of the application of international accounting standards on banks’ capital, by treating more
favourably public guarantees granted during this crisis, by postponing the date of application of the leverage
ratio buffer, by setting a temporary prudential filter to mitigate the considerable negative impact of the volatility
in central government debt markets during the COVID-19 pandemic on institutions, by modifying the way of
excluding certain exposures from the calculation of the leverage ratio[41], by advancing the date of application of
several agreed measures that incentivise banks to finance employees, SMEs and infrastructure projects and by
aligning the minimum coverage requirements for NPLs that benefit from public guarantees with those that
benefit from guarantees granted by official export credit agencies (among others).

On 3 December 2020, the Bank was informed by the ECB of the results of the SREP, which include the
supervisory decision regarding capital requirements applicable to the Group for 2021 (applicable both at an
individual and consolidated level). The details of these capital requirements are described below:

**Total**

**[CET1 ratio ]** **capital**

### Pillar 1 .........................................................................................................  4.50% 8.00%
 Pillar 2 (P2R)[42] ............................................................................................  0.98% 1.75%
 Conservation buffer .....................................................................................  2.50% 2.50%
 Other buffers ...............................................................................................  0.00% 0.00%
 Total requirement .....................................................................................  7.98% 12.25%

The table below sets out the Group’s capital position as of 30 September 2021, 31 December 2020 and 31
December 2019:

40 The CRD V Directive establishes that P2R can be partially covered by Additional Tier 1 Instruments and Tier 2 Instruments, at least 56.25%

must be covered with CET1, 18.75% with Additional Tier 1 and 25% with Tier 2. Before the CRD V Directive, and prior to their decision on
12 March 2020 related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ECB required P2R to be covered with CET1 in its entirety.

41 On 18 June 2021 the ECB determined that exceptional circumstances continue to exist to warrant the exclusion of the central bank exposures

listed in the Quick Fix.

42 P2R only applies at a consolidated level. This P2R has been set for Unicaja prior to the Merger and therefore is subject to change.

As of 30 September 2021, the RWAs of the Group amounted to €35,699 million (€22,492 million and €22,983
million as of 31 December 2020 and 2019, respectively).

Any failure by the Bank or by the Group to comply with its regulatory capital requirements could result in the
imposition of administrative actions or sanctions, such as further P2Rs or the adoption of any early intervention
or, ultimately, resolution measures by resolution authorities pursuant to Law 11/2015, which, together with
Royal Decree 1012/2015 have implemented BRRD into Spanish law. See “Risk Factors Risks relating to the
_Issuer and the Group —_ _—Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks —_ _Increasingly onerous capital, liquidity_
_and funding requirements constitute one of the Group’s main regulatory challenges”._

### Leverage ratio

In addition to the above, Article 429 of the CRR I requires institutions to calculate their leverage ratio (“LR”)
in accordance with the methodology laid down in that article. The EU Banking Reforms contain a binding 3%
Tier 1 LR requirement, that has been added to the own funds requirements in Article 92 of the CRR I, and which
institutions must meet in addition to their risk-based requirements.

This LR requirement is a parallel requirement to the risk-based own funds requirements described above. Thus,
any additional own funds requirements imposed by competent authorities to address the risk of excessive
leverage should be added to the minimum leverage ratio requirement and not to the minimum risk based own
funds requirement. Furthermore, institutions should also be able to use any CET1 instruments that they use to
meet their leverage-related requirements to meet their risk-based own funds requirements, including the
“combined buffer requirement”.

The table below sets out the Group’s LRs as of 30 September 2021, 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019:

**30 September 2021** **31 December 2020** **31 December 2019**

Leverage ratio.............. 5.1% 4.6% 6.1% 5.5% 6.4% 5.8%

### MREL requirements

In addition to the minimum capital requirements under CRD IV, the BRRD regime prescribes that banks shall
hold a minimum level of capital and eligible liabilities. The MREL shall be calculated as the amount of own
funds and eligible liabilities and expressed as a percentage of the total liabilities and own funds of the institution
(pursuant to BRRD II, it shall be expressed as a percentage of the total risk exposure amount or the total
exposure measure of the institution, calculated in each case in accordance with CRR I). The level of capital and
eligible liabilities required under MREL is set by the resolution authority for each bank (and/or group) based
on the resolution plan and other criteria. The resolution authority for the Bank is the SRB. Eligible liabilities
may be senior or subordinated liabilities, provided, among other requirements, that they have a remaining

by the ECB.

maturity of at least one year and, if governed by a non-EU law, they must be able to be written down or converted
under that law (including through contractual provisions).

The EU Banking Reforms further include, as part of MREL, a new subordination requirement of eligible
instruments for G-SIIs and “top tier” banks involving a minimum MREL “Pillar 1” subordination requirement
and an institution specific MREL “Pillar 2” subordination requirement. This “Pillar 1” subordination
requirement shall be satisfied with own funds and other eligible MREL instruments (which MREL instruments
may not for these purposes be senior debt instruments and only MREL instruments constituting “non-preferred”
senior debt under the new insolvency hierarchy introduced in Spain by RDL 11/2017 will be eligible for
compliance with the subordination requirement). Resolution authorities may also impose “Pillar 2”
subordination requirements (including to institutions not constituting G-SIIs or “top tier” banks), which would
be determined on a case-by-case basis but subject to certain caps.

In February 2021 Unicaja Banco received a formal communication from the Bank of Spain regarding the MREL
requirement on a consolidated basis, as determined by the SRB. In accordance with such communication,
Unicaja Banco must comply by 1 January 2024 with a minimum of own funds and eligible liabilities of 18.01%
of the TREA (excluding the capital allocated to cover the “combined buffer requirement”) and 5.24% of the
LRE. As for the intermediate requirement, the SRB has decided that, by 1 January 2022, Unicaja Banco must
comply with an amount of own funds and eligible liabilities on a consolidated basis equal to 15.63% of the
TREA (excluding the capital allocated to cover the “combined buffer requirement”) and 5.24% of the LRE. The
MREL requirement is aligned with the Bank’s expectations and the funding plan as described in its strategic
plan. As of 30 September 2021, Unicaja Banco reached a MREL ratio of 16.6% of the TREA and 5.6% of the
LRE at consolidated level.

According to the EU Banking Reforms, any failure by an institution to meet the applicable minimum MREL
requirements will be treated similarly as a failure to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements, where
resolution authorities must ensure that they intervene and place an institution into resolution sufficiently early
if it is deemed to be failing or likely to fail and there is no reasonable prospect of recovery.

If any Relevant Resolution Authority (as defined below) finds that there could exist any obstacles to
resolvability of the Bank and/or the Group, a higher MREL could be imposed. In addition, as of the date of this
Prospectus, no information on the MREL requirement for the Group resulting from the Merger is available.

### Liquidity requirements

The Group should also comply with the liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”) requirements provided in CRR I. The
LCR is the short-term indicator which expresses the ratio between the amount of available assets readily
monetizable (cash and the readily liquidable securities held by the Group) and the net cash imbalance
accumulated over a 30-day liquidity stress period. It is a quantitative liquidity standard designed to ensure that
banks have sufficient high-quality liquid assets to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30-day liquidity
stress period. Since 1 January 2018, the entities to which this standard applies (including the Group) must
comply with 100% of the applicable LCR requirement. The LCR of the Group was 300% as of 30 September
2021 (310% and 319% as of 31 December 2020 and 2019, respectively).

The BCBS’ net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is the 12-month structural liquidity indicator which corresponds
to the ratio between the available amount of stable funding and the statutory amount of stable funding. It has
been developed to provide a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities such that banks maintain a
stable funding profile in relation to their on- and off-balance sheet activities that reduces the likelihood that
disruptions to a bank’s regular sources of funding will erode its liquidity position in a way that could increase
the risk of its failure. The BCBS contemplated in the Basel III phase-in arrangements document that the NSFR,
including any revisions, would be implemented by member countries as a minimum standard by 1 January
2018, with no phase-in scheduled. The EU Banking Reforms contain the implementation of the BCBS standard

A46786082

on NSFR introducing some adjustments. The NSFR ratio of the Group was 140% as of 30 September 2021
(142% and 141% as of 31 December 2020 and 2019, respectively).

### Loss absorbing powers by the Relevant Resolution Authority under Law 11/2015 and the SRM Regulation 

The BRRD (which has been implemented in Spain through Law 11/2015 and Royal Decree 1012/2015) is
designed to provide authorities with a credible set of tools to intervene sufficiently early and quickly in unsound
or failing credit institutions or investment firms (each an “institution”) so as to ensure the continuity of the
institution’s critical financial and economic functions, while minimising the impact of an institution’s failure
on the economy and financial system.

In accordance with Article 20 of Law 11/2015, an institution will be considered as failing or likely to fail in any
of the following circumstances: (i) it is, or is likely in the near future to be, in significant breach of its solvency
or any other requirements necessary for maintaining its authorisation; (ii) its assets are, or are likely in the near
future to be, less than its liabilities; (iii) it is, or is likely in the near future to be, unable to pay its debts as they
fall due; or (iv) it requires extraordinary public financial support (except in limited circumstances). The
determination that an institution is no longer viable may depend on a number of factors which may be outside
of that institution’s control.

As provided in the BRRD, Law 11/2015 contains four resolution tools and powers which may be used alone or
in combination where the FROB, the SRB established pursuant to the SRM Regulation, as the case may be and
according to Law 11/2015, the Bank of Spain or the CNMV, or any other entity with the authority to exercise
any such tools and powers from time to time or to perform the role of a primary bank resolution authority (each,
a “Relevant Resolution Authority”) as appropriate, considers that (a) an institution is failing or likely to fail
in the near future, (b) there is no reasonable prospect that any alternative private sector measures would prevent
the failure of such institution within a reasonable timeframe, and (c) a resolution action is in the public interest.

The four resolution tools are: (i) sale of business (which enables the Relevant Resolution Authority to direct the
sale of the institution or the whole or part of its business on commercial terms); (ii) bridge institution (which
enables the Relevant Resolution Authority to transfer all or part of the business of the institution to a “bridge
institution” (an entity created for this purpose that is wholly or partially in public control)); (iii) asset separation
(which enables the Relevant Resolution Authority to transfer certain categories of assets to one or more publicly
owned asset management vehicles to allow them to be managed with a view to maximising their value through
eventual sale or orderly wind-down (this can be used together with another resolution tool only)); and (iv) the
bail-in (which includes certain elements of the Spanish Bail-in Power (as defined below). The bail-in includes
the ability of the Relevant Resolution Authority to write down (including to zero) and/or to convert into equity
or other securities or obligations (which equity, securities and obligations could also be subject to any future
application of the Spanish Bail-in Power) certain unsecured debt claims and subordinated obligations (including
capital instruments such as the Notes).

The “Spanish Bail-in Power” is any write down, conversion, transfer, modification, or suspension power
existing from time to time under, and exercised in compliance with any laws, regulations, rules or requirements
in effect in Spain, relating to the transposition of the BRRD, as amended from time to time, including, but not
limited to (i) Law 11/2015, as amended from time to time, (ii) Royal Decree 1012/2015, as amended from time
to time, (iii) the SRM Regulation, as amended from time to time, and (iv) any other instruments, rules or
standards made in connection with either (i), (ii) or (iii), pursuant to which any obligation of an institution can
be reduced, cancelled, modified, or converted into shares, other securities, or other obligations of such
institution or any other person (or suspended for a temporary period).

In accordance with Article 48 of Law 11/2015 (and subject to any exclusions that may be applied by the
Relevant Resolution Authority under Article 43 of Law 11/2015), in the case of any application of the Spanish

A46786082

128


-----

Bail-in Power to absorb losses and cover the amount of the recapitalisation, the sequence of any resulting write
down or conversion shall be as follows: (i) CET1 items; (ii) the principal amount of Additional Tier 1
Instruments; (iii) the principal amount of Tier 2 Instruments (which for so long as the obligations of the Bank
in respect of the Notes constitute Tier 2 Instruments, shall include the Notes); (iv) the principal amount of other
subordinated claims that do not qualify as Additional Tier 1 Capital or Tier 2 capital and (v) the principal or
outstanding amount of bail-inable liabilities in accordance with the hierarchy of claims in normal insolvency
proceedings (with “non-preferred” senior claims subject to the Spanish Bail-in Power after any subordinated
claims against the Bank but before the other senior claims against the Bank).

In addition to the Spanish Bail-in Power, the BRRD, Law 11/2015 and the SRM Regulation provide for the
Relevant Resolution Authority to have the further power to permanently write down or convert into equity
capital instruments and certain internal eligible liabilities at the point of non-viability of an institution or a group
of which the institution forms part (“Non-Viability Loss Absorption”) of an institution or a group. The point
of non-viability of an institution is the point at which the Relevant Resolution Authority determines that the
institution meets the conditions for resolution or that it will no longer be viable unless the relevant capital
instruments are written down or converted into equity or extraordinary public support is to be provided and
without such support the Relevant Resolution Authority determines that the institution would no longer be
viable. The point of non-viability of a group is the point at which the group infringes or there are objective
elements to support a determination that the group, in the near future, will infringe its consolidated solvency
requirements in a way that would justify action by the Relevant Resolution Authority in accordance with Article
38.3 of Law 11/2015. Non-Viability Loss Absorption may be imposed prior to or in combination with any
exercise of any other Spanish Bail-in Power or any other resolution tool or power (where the conditions for
resolution referred to above are met).

In accordance with Article 64.1(i) of Law 11/2015, the Relevant Resolution Authority has also the power to
alter the amount of interest payable under debt instruments and other bail-inable liabilities of institutions subject
to resolution proceedings and the date on which the interest becomes payable under the debt instrument
(including the power to suspend payment for a temporary period).

### Prudential treatment of NPLs

On 15 March 2018, the ECB published the addendum (the “Addendum”) to the ECB Guidance to banks on
NPLs published on 20 March 2017 (the “NPL Guidance”). The Addendum specifies the ECB’s supervisory
expectations for prudent levels of provisions for new NPLs, it is non-binding but will serve as the basis for the
supervisory dialogue between the significant banks and ECB banking supervision. The ECB assesses any
differences between banks’ practices and the prudential provisioning expectations laid out in the Addendum at
least annually. During the supervisory dialogue, the ECB discusses with each bank divergences from the
prudential provisioning expectations laid out in the addendum. After this dialogue and taking into account the
bank’s specific situation, ECB Banking Supervision decides, on a case-by-case basis, whether and which
supervisory measures are appropriate. The result of this dialogue will be incorporated, for the first time, in the
2021 SREP. In addition, in a press release dated 11 July 2018, the ECB announced that, in order to address the
stock of NPLs and with the aim of achieving the same coverage of NPL stock and flow over the medium term,
it would set bank-specific supervisory expectations for the provisioning of NPLs. Such supervisory expectations
for NPL provisioning, which are part of the ongoing supervisory dialogue, will add more pressure on financial
results.

As part of the EU Commission’s package of measures aimed at addressing the risks related to high levels of
NPLs in Europe, Regulation (EU) 2019/630 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019
amends CRR I as regards minimum loss coverage for non-performing exposures (“NPEs”), introducing a clear
set of conditions for the classification of NPEs. This regulation establishes clear criteria on the determination
of NPEs, the concept of forbearance measures, deduction for NPEs and treatment of expected loss amounts.

Besides the measures contained in the COVID-19 Banking Package, in connection with the measures adopted
in reaction to the COVID-19 outbreak and more specifically in connection with the measures announced by the
ECB to ensure that its directly supervised banks can continue to fulfil their role to fund households and
corporations, the ECB announced additional measures introducing supervisory flexibility regarding the
treatment of NPLs, in particular to allow banks to fully benefit from guarantees and moratoriums put in place
by public authorities to tackle the current distress. In light of that scenario, the EBA has also issued statements
regarding the prudential framework in relation to the classification of loans in default, classification of
exposures under the definition of forbearance or as defaulted under distressed restructuring, and their
accounting treatment. In particular, the EBA has clarified that generalised payment delays due to legislative
initiatives and addressed to all borrowers do not lead to any automatic classification in default, forborne or
unlikeliness to pay (individual assessments of the likeliness to pay should be prioritized) and has clarified the
requirements for public and private moratoria, which if fulfilled, are expected to help avoid the classification
of exposures under the definition of forbearance or as defaulted under distressed restructuring.

### TAXATION

_The following is a general description of certain Spanish tax considerations relating to the Notes. It does not_
_purport to be a complete analysis of all tax considerations relating to the Notes whether in those countries or_
_elsewhere. Prospective purchasers of Notes should consult their own tax advisers as to the consequences under_
_the tax laws of the country of which they are resident for tax purposes and the tax laws of Spain of acquiring,_
_holding and disposing of Notes and receiving payments of interest, principal and/or other amounts under the_
_Notes. This summary is based upon the law as in effect on the date of this Prospectus and is subject to any_
_change in law that may take effect after such date._

_Also investors should note that the appointment by an investor in Notes, or any person through which an_
_investor holds Notes, of a custodian, collection agent or similar person in relation to such Notes in any_
_jurisdiction may have tax implications. Investors should consult their own tax advisers in relation to the tax_
_consequences for them of any such appointment._

### Spanish tax considerations 

The following summary describes the main Spanish tax implications arising in connection with the acquisition
and holding of the Notes by individuals or entities who are the beneficial owners of the Notes. The information
provided below does not purport to be a complete analysis of the tax law and practice currently applicable in
Spain, and it is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or tax advice, and does not address all
the tax consequences applicable to all categories of investors, some of which (such as look through entities or
Holders by reason of employment) may be subject to special rules.

All the tax consequences described in this section are based on the general assumption that the Notes are initially
registered for clearance and settlement in Iberclear.

Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their own tax advisers as to the tax consequences, including
those under the tax laws of the country of which they are resident, of purchasing, owning and disposing of the
Notes.

This information has been prepared in accordance with the following Spanish tax legislation in force at the date
of this Prospectus:

(a) of general application, the First Additional Provision of Law 10/2014, as well as Royal Decree
1065/2007, of 27 July, approving the General Regulations of the tax inspection and management
procedures and developing the common rules of the procedures to apply taxes, as amended by Royal
Decree 1145/2011 of 29 July (“Royal Decree 1065/2007”);

Law 35/2006, of 28 November, on the PIT and on the partial amendment of the Corporate Income
Tax Law, Non-Resident Income Tax Law and Wealth Tax Law, as amended (the “PIT Law”), and
Royal Decree 439/2007, of 30 March, approving the PIT Regulations, as amended (the “PIT
**Regulations”) by Royal Decree 633/2015, of 10 July, along with Law 19/1991, of 6 June, on Wealth**
Tax, as amended, and Law 29/1987, of 18 December, on Inheritance and Gift Tax, as amended;

taxpayers, the **CIT Law, and Royal Decree 634/2015, of 10 July, promulgating the CIT**
Regulations, as amended (the “CIT Regulations”); and

(d) for individuals and entities who are not resident for tax purposes in Spain which are Non-Resident
Income Tax (“NRIT”) taxpayers, Royal Legislative Decree 5/2004, of 5 March, promulgating the
Consolidated Text of the NRIT Law, as amended (“NRIT Law”) and Royal Decree 1776/2004, of

A46786082

131


-----

30 July, promulgating the NRIT Regulations, as amended (“NRIT Regulations”) along with Law
19/1991, of 6 June, on Wealth Tax as amended and Law 29/1987, of 18 December, on Inheritance
and Gift Tax, as amended.

### Tax treatment of the Notes

 Indirect taxation

Whatever the nature and residence of the Holder, the acquisition and transfer of Notes will be exempt from
indirect taxes in Spain, i.e. exempt from Transfer Tax and Stamp Duty, in accordance with the Consolidated
Text of such tax promulgated by Royal Legislative Decree 1/1993, dated 24 September 1993 and exempt from
Value Added Tax, in accordance with Law 37/1992, dated 28 December 1992 regulating such tax.

Unicaja Banco understands that the Notes should be deemed as financial assets with an explicit yield for Spanish
tax purposes, according to Article 91 of the PIT Regulations and Article 63 of the CIT Regulations.

### Direct taxation
 (a) Individuals with tax residency in Spain

**Personal Income Tax (Impuesto sobre la Renta de las Personas Físicas)**

Both interest periodically received and income derived from the transfer, redemption or repayment of
the Notes constitute a return on investment obtained from the transfer of own capital to third parties in
accordance with the provisions of Section 25.2 of the PIT Law, and must be included in each investor’s
savings income and taxed at the tax rate applicable from time to time, currently 19% for taxable income
up to €6,000; 21% for taxable income between €6,000.01 and €50,000; 23% for taxable income between
€50,000.01 and €200,000 and 26% for taxable income exceeding €200,000.

Income from the transfer of the Notes is computed as the difference between their transfer value and
their acquisition or subscription value. Also, ancillary acquisition and disposal charges are taken into
account, insofar as adequately evidenced, in calculating the income.

Negative income derived from the transfer of the Notes, in the event that the investor had acquired other
homogeneous securities within the two months prior or subsequent to such transfer or exchange, shall
be included in his or her PIT base as and when the remaining homogeneous securities are transferred.

When calculating the net income, expenses related to the management and deposit of the Notes will be
deductible, excluding those pertaining to discretionary or individual portfolio management.

A (current) 19% withholding on account of PIT will be imposed by Unicaja Banco on interest payments
as well as on income derived from the redemption or repayment of the Notes, by individual investors
subject to PIT.

However, income derived from the transfer of the Notes should not be subject to withholding on account
of PIT provided that the Notes are:

(i) registered by way of book entries; and

(ii) negotiated in a Spanish official secondary market (mercado secundario oficial), such as
AIAF.

Notwithstanding the above, 19% withholding tax shall apply on the part of the transfer price that
corresponds to the accrued interest when the transfer of the Notes takes place within the 30-day period
prior to the moment in which such interest is due when the following requirements are fulfilled:

(i) the acquirer would be a non-resident or a CIT taxpayer;

A46786082

132


-----

(ii) the explicit yield derived from the Notes being transferred is exempt from withholding tax.

In any event, the individual holder may credit the withholding tax applied by Unicaja Banco against his
or her final PIT liability for the relevant tax year.

**Reporting Obligations**

Unicaja Banco will comply with the reporting obligations set forth in the Spanish tax laws with respect
to beneficial owners of the Notes that are individuals resident in Spain for tax purposes.

**Wealth Tax (Impuesto sobre el Patrimonio)**

According to Wealth Tax regulations (subject to any exceptions provided under relevant legislation in
each autonomous region (Comunidad Autónoma), individuals with tax residency in Spain would be
subject to Wealth Tax to the extent that their net worth exceeds €700,000 (subject to any exceptions
provided under relevant legislation in an autonomous region (Comunidad Autónoma). Therefore, they
should take into account the value of the Notes which they hold as of 31 December in each year, the
applicable rates ranging between 0.2% and 3.5% although the final tax rates may vary depending on any
applicable regional tax laws, and some reductions may apply.

**Inheritance and Gift Tax (Impuesto sobre Sucesiones y Donaciones)**

Individuals with tax residency in Spain who acquire ownership or other rights over any Notes by
inheritance, gift or legacy will be subject to inheritance and gift tax in accordance with the applicable
Spanish regional or state rules. The applicable rates range between 7.65% and 81.6%, although the final
tax rate may vary depending on any applicable regional tax laws. Some tax benefits could reduce the
effective tax rate.

### (b) Spanish tax resident legal entities

**Corporate Income Tax (Impuesto sobre Sociedades)**

Both interest periodically received and income derived from the transfer, redemption or repayment of
the Notes are subject to CIT at the current general flat tax rate of 25%.

However, this general rate will not be applicable to all CIT taxpayers and, for instance, it will not apply
to banking institutions (which will be taxed at the rate of 30%).

No withholding on account of CIT will be imposed on interest payments or on income derived from the
redemption or repayment of the Notes, by Spanish CIT taxpayers provided that certain requirements are
met (including that the Iberclear Members that have the Notes registered in their securities account on
behalf of third parties, as well as the entities that manage the clearing systems located outside Spain that
have an agreement with Iberclear, provide Unicaja Banco, in a timely manner, with a duly executed and
completed Payment Statement, as defined below). See “—Compliance with Certain Requirements in
_Connection with Income Payments”._

With regard to income derived from the transfer of the Notes, in accordance with Article 61.q of the CIT
Regulations, there is no obligation to withhold on income derived from the Notes obtained by Spanish
CIT taxpayers (which include Spanish tax resident investment funds and Spanish tax resident pension
funds) provided that the Notes are:

(i) registered by way of book entries; and

(ii) negotiated in a Spanish official secondary market, such as AIAF.

**Reporting Obligations**

A46786082

133


-----

Unicaja Banco will comply with the reporting obligations set forth in the Spanish tax laws with respect
to beneficial owners of the Notes that are legal persons or entities resident in Spain for tax purposes.

**Wealth Tax (Impuesto sobre el Patrimonio)**

Legal entities resident in Spain for tax purposes that acquire ownership or other rights over the Notes
are not subject to Spanish Wealth Tax.

**Inheritance and Gift Tax (Impuesto sobre Sucesiones y Donaciones)**

Legal entities resident in Spain for tax purposes that acquire ownership or other rights over the Notes by
inheritance, gift or legacy are not subject to the Inheritance and Gift Tax but generally must include the
market value of the Notes in their taxable income for CIT purposes.

### (c) Individuals and legal entities that are not tax resident in Spain

(i) Investors that are not resident in Spain for tax purposes, acting in respect of the Notes
through a permanent establishment in Spain

**Non-resident Income Tax (Impuesto sobre la Renta de no Residentes)**

If the Notes form part of the assets affected to a permanent establishment in Spain of a person or
legal entity that is not resident in Spain for tax purposes, the tax rules applicable to income
deriving from such Notes are, generally, the same as those set forth above for Spanish CIT
taxpayers. See “—Spanish tax resident legal entities–Corporate Income Tax (Impuesto sobre
_Sociedades)”._

Ownership of the Notes by investors who are not resident in Spain for tax purposes will not in
itself create the existence of a permanent establishment in Spain.

**Reporting Obligations**

Unicaja Banco will comply with the reporting obligations set forth under Spanish tax laws with
respect to beneficial owners of the Notes that are individuals or legal entities not resident in Spain
for tax purposes and that act with respect to the Notes through a permanent establishment in
Spain.

(ii) Investors that are not resident in Spain for tax purposes, not acting in respect of the Notes
through a permanent establishment in Spain

**Non-resident Income Tax (Impuesto sobre la Renta de no Residentes)**

Both interest payments periodically received under the Notes and income derived from the
transfer, redemption or repayment of the Notes, obtained by individuals or entities who are not
resident in Spain for tax purposes and who do not act, with respect to the Notes, through a
permanent establishment in Spain, are exempt from NRIT and therefore no withholding on
account of NRIT will be levied on such income provided certain requirements are met.

In order to be eligible for the exemption from NRIT, certain requirements must be met (including
that, in respect of interest payments from the Notes carried out by Unicaja Banco, the Iberclear
Members that have the Notes registered in their securities account on behalf of third parties, as
well as the entities that manage the clearing systems located outside Spain that have an agreement
with Iberclear, provide Unicaja Banco, in a timely manner, with a duly executed and completed
Payment Statement, as defined below), as set forth in Article 44 of Royal Decree 1065/2007. See
“—Compliance with Certain Requirements in Connection with Income Payments”.

A46786082

134


-----

A46786082


If the Iberclear Members fail or for any reason are unable to deliver a duly executed and
completed Payment Statement to Unicaja Banco in a timely manner in respect of a payment of
interest under the Notes, Unicaja Banco will withhold Spanish withholding tax at the applicable
rate (currently 19 per cent.) on such payment of income on the Notes and Unicaja Banco will not
pay additional amounts with respect to any such withholding.

A beneficial owner who is not resident in Spain for tax purposes and entitled to exemption from
NRIT, but to whom payment was not exempt from Spanish withholding tax due to a failure on
the delivery of a duly executed and completed Payment Statement to Unicaja Banco, will receive
a refund of the amount withheld, with no need for action on the beneficial owner’s part, if Unicaja
Banco receives a duly executed and completed Payment Statement no later than the tenth calendar
day of the month immediately following the relevant payment date.

In addition, beneficial owners of the Notes may apply directly to the Spanish tax authorities for
any refund to which they may be entitled, according to the procedures set forth in the NRIT Law
and its regulations.

**Wealth Tax (Impuesto sobre el Patrimonio)**

According to Wealth Tax regulations, non-Spanish resident individuals whose properties and
rights located in Spain, or that can be exercised within the Spanish territory exceed €700,000
would be subject to Wealth Tax, the applicable rates ranging between 0.2% and 3.5% although
some reductions may apply.

However, non-Spanish resident individuals will be exempt from Wealth Tax in respect of the
Notes which income is exempt from NRIT as described above.

Individuals resident in a country with which Spain has entered into a double tax treaty in relation
to the Wealth Tax would generally not be subject to such tax.

Individuals that are not resident in Spain for tax purposes may apply the rules approved by the
autonomous region where the assets and rights with more value (i) are located, (ii) can be
exercised or (iii) must be fulfilled.

Non-Spanish resident legal entities are not subject to Wealth Tax.

**Inheritance and Gift Tax (Impuesto sobre Sucesiones y Donaciones)**

Individuals who do not have tax residency in Spain who acquire ownership or other rights over
the Notes by inheritance, gift or legacy, and who reside in a country with which Spain has entered
into a double tax treaty in relation to inheritance and gift tax will be subject to the relevant double
tax treaty.

If no treaty for the avoidance of double taxation in relation to Inheritance and Gift Tax applies,
applicable Inheritance and Gift Tax rates would range between 7.65% and 81.6%, depending on
relevant factors.

Generally, non-Spanish tax resident individuals are subject to Inheritance and Gift Tax according
to the rules set forth in the Spanish state level or relevant autonomous region law. As such,
prospective investors should consult their tax advisers.

Non-Spanish resident legal entities which acquire ownership or other rights over the Notes by
inheritance, gift or legacy are not subject to inheritance and gift tax. They will be subject to NRIT.
If the legal entity is resident in a country with which Spain has entered into a double tax treaty,

135


-----

the provisions of such treaty will apply. In general, double-tax treaties provide for the taxation of
this type of income in the country of residence of the beneficiary.

### (d) Compliance with certain requirements in connection with income payments

As described under “Spanish tax resident legal entities—Corporate Income Tax (Impuesto sobre
_Sociedades)”, “—Individuals and legal entities that are not tax resident in Spain”, provided the_
conditions set forth in Law 10/2014 are met, income payments made by Unicaja Banco in respect of the
Notes for the benefit of Spanish CIT taxpayers, or for the benefit of non-Spanish tax resident investors
will not be subject to Spanish withholding tax, provided that the Iberclear Members that have the Notes
registered in their securities account on behalf of third parties, as well as the entities that manage the
clearing systems located outside Spain that have an agreement with Iberclear, if applicable, provide
Unicaja Banco, in a timely manner, with a duly executed and completed statement (a “Payment
**Statement”) (which is attached as Annex I), in accordance with section 4 of Article 44 of Royal Decree**
1065/2007 containing the following information:

(i) Identification of the Notes.

(ii) Total amount of the income paid by Unicaja Banco.

(iii) Amount of the income corresponding to individual residents in Spain that are PIT taxpayers.

(iv) Amount of the income that must be paid on a gross basis.

If the Iberclear Members fail or for any reason are unable to deliver a duly executed and completed
Payment Statement to Unicaja Banco in a timely manner in respect of a payment of income made by
Unicaja Banco under the Notes, such payment will be made net of Spanish withholding tax, currently at
the rate of 19%. If this were to occur, affected beneficial owners will receive a refund of the amount
withheld, with no need for action on their part, if the Iberclear Members submit a duly executed and
completed Payment Statement to Unicaja Banco no later than the tenth calendar day of the month
immediately following the relevant payment date. In addition, beneficial owners may apply directly to
the Spanish tax authorities for any refund to which they may be entitled, according to the procedures set
forth in the Spanish NRIT Law.

**Prospective investors should note that Unicaja Banco does not accept any responsibility relating**
**to the lack of delivery of a duly executed and completed Payment Statement by the Iberclear**
**Members in connection with each payment of income under the Notes. Accordingly, Unicaja Banco**
**will not be liable for any damage or loss suffered by any beneficial owner who would otherwise be**
**entitled to an exemption from Spanish withholding tax but whose income payments are**
**nonetheless paid net of Spanish withholding tax because the Payment Statement was not duly**
**delivered to Unicaja Banco. Moreover, Unicaja Banco will not pay any additional amounts with**
**respect to any such withholding tax.**

### The proposed financial transactions tax (“FTT”) 

On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s proposal”) for a
Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal,
Slovenia and Slovakia (the “participating Member States”). However, Estonia has ceased to participate.

The Commission’s proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the
Notes (including secondary’ market transactions) in certain circumstances.

Under the Commission’s proposal, FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside
of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one

A46786082

136


-----

party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial
institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a participating Member State in a broad range of
circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b)
where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating Member State.

However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between participating Member States. It may
therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU Member
States may decide to participate.

Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

### Spanish FTT

The FTT Law was published in the Spanish Official Gazette (Boletín Oficial del Estado) on 16 October 2020.
The Spanish FTT came into force three months after the publication of the FTT Law in the Spanish Official
Gazette (that is, on 16 January 2021).

Spanish FTT will charge a 0.2% rate on specific acquisitions of listed shares issued by Spanish companies
whose market capitalization exceeds €1 billion, regardless of the jurisdiction of residence of the parties involved
in the transaction.

For the purposes of transactions closed during 2021, the Spanish tax authorities issued a list of entities whose
market capitalization exceeded €1 billion as of 16 December 2020, that will fall within the scope of the Spanish
FTT. The Issuer was included in such list.

This being said, the Spanish FTT would not apply in relation to the Notes since (i) the Spanish FTT only applies
on the acquisition of shares of certain Spanish companies, so while the Notes are not affected by such tax; and
(ii) transactions in the primary market and initial public offerings are exempt from the Spanish FTT. However,
it may subject other transactions involving the transfer of ordinary shares in the future depending on the market
capitalization of the Issuer and other factors.

As such, prospective investors should consult their tax advisers in relation to the Spanish FTT.

### FATCA

Pursuant to certain provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, commonly known as FATCA, a
“foreign financial institution” may be required to withhold on certain payments it makes (“foreign passthru
**payments”) to persons that fail to meet certain certification, reporting, or related requirements. Unicaja Banco**
may be a foreign financial institution for these purposes. A number of jurisdictions (including the jurisdiction
of Unicaja Banco) have entered into, or have agreed in substance to, intergovernmental agreements with the
United States to implement FATCA (“IGAs”), which modify the way in which FATCA applies in their
jurisdictions. Under the provisions of IGAs as currently in effect, a foreign financial institution in an IGA
jurisdiction would generally not be required to withhold under FATCA or an IGA from payments that it makes.
Certain aspects of the application of the FATCA provisions and IGAs to instruments such as the Notes, including
whether withholding would ever be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on
instruments such as the Notes, are uncertain and may be subject to change. Even if withholding would be
required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as the Notes, such
withholding would not apply prior to the date that is two years after the publication of the final regulations
defining “foreign passthru payment”. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding how these rules
may apply to their investment in the Notes. In the event any withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA
or an IGA with respect to payments on the Notes, no person will be required to pay additional amounts as a
result of the withholding.

### MARKET INFORMATION

 Summary of clearance and settlement procedures

Below is a brief summary of the Spanish clearance and settlement procedures applicable to book-entry securities
such as the Notes of Unicaja Banco.

The Spanish clearing, settlement and recording system of securities transactions has undergone a significant
reform to align it with the EU practices and standards and prepare it for the implementation of future integration
projects (the “Reform”). Following the Reform, which implementation was completed by 18 September 2017,
the Spanish clearing, settlement and registry procedures of securities transactions allows the connection of the
post-trading Spanish systems to the European system TARGET2 Securities.

The Reform has introduced three main changes that, in turn, involve a number of operating modifications. These
changes include (i) a new recording system based on balances, (ii) the introduction of a central clearing
counterparty (BME Clearing, S.A., “BME Clearing” or the “CCP”), and (iii) the integration of the current
CADE (Central de Anotaciones de Deuda Pública) and SCLV (Servicio de Compensación y Liquidación de
_Valores) into a single platform managed by Iberclear which operates under the trade name of ARCO._

### Iberclear and BME Clearing

Iberclear is the Spanish central securities depository in charge of both the register of securities held in bookentry form, and the settlement of all trades from the Spanish Stock Exchanges, Latibex (the Latin American
stock exchange denominated in Euro), the Alternative Stock Market (BME Growth), Alternative Fixed Income
Market (MARF) and AIAF. To achieve this, Iberclear uses the technical platforms named ARCO.

Iberclear and BME Clearing are owned by BME Bolsas y Mercados Españoles, Sociedad Holding de Mercados
y Sistemas Financieros, S.A. (“BME”), a holding company controlled by SIX Group, which holds a 100%
interest in each of the Spanish official secondary markets and settlement systems. The corporate address of
Iberclear is Plaza de la Lealtad 1, 28014 Madrid, Spain.

The securities recording system of Iberclear is a two tier registry: the keeping of the central record corresponds
to Iberclear and the keeping of the detail records correspond to the participating entities (entidades
_participantes) in Iberclear._

Access to become a participating entity is restricted to (i) credit institutions, (ii) investment services companies
which are authorised to render custody and administration of financial instruments, (iii) the Bank of Spain, (iv)
the General Administration and the General Social Security Treasury, (v) other duly authorised central securities
depositories and central clearing counterparties and (vi) other public institutions and private entities when
expressly authorised to become a participating entity in central securities depositories.

The central registry managed by Iberclear reflects (i) one or several proprietary accounts which show the
balances of the participating entities’ proprietary accounts; (ii) one or several general third-party accounts that
will show the overall balances that the participating entities hold for third parties; (iii) individual accounts
opened in the name of the owner, either individual or legal person; and (iv) individual special accounts of
financial intermediaries which use the optional procedure of settlement of orders. Each participating entity, in
turn, maintains the detail records of the owners of the securities or the shares held in their general third-party
accounts.

According to the above, Spanish law considers the owner of the securities to be:

   - the participating entity appearing in the records of Iberclear as holding the relevant securities in its own
name;

   - the investor appearing in the records of the participating entity as holding the securities; or

A46786082

145


-----

   - the investor appearing in the records of Iberclear as holding securities in a segregated individual account.

BME Clearing is the CCP in charge of the clearing of transactions closed on the Spanish Stock Exchanges.
BME Clearing interposes itself on its own account as seller in every purchase and as buyer in every sale. It
calculates the buy and sell positions vis-à-vis the participants designated in such buy or sell instructions. The
CCP then generates and send to Iberclear the relevant settlement instructions. BME Clearing is also owned by
BME.

The settlement and book-entry registration platform managed by Iberclear, which operates under the trade name
of ARCO (for both equity securities and fixed-income securities as from September 2017), receives the
settlement instructions from BME Clearing and forwards them to the relevant participating entities involved in
each transaction. ARCO operates under a T+2 settlement standard, by which any transactions must be settled
within two business days following the date on which the transaction was completed.

To evidence title to securities, at the owner’s request the relevant participating entity must issue a legitimation
certificate (certificado de legitimación). If the owner is a participating entity or a person holding securities in a
segregated individual account, Iberclear is in charge of the issuance of the certificate regarding the securities
held in their name.

### Market Information in relation to the Notes

 Iberclear settlement of securities traded in AIAF

Iberclear and the participating entities (entidades participantes) in Iberclear have the function of keeping the
book-entry register of securities traded on AIAF.

Securities traded in AIAF are fixed income securities, including corporate bonds (for example, medium term
Notes and mortgage bonds) and bonds issued by the Spanish Treasury and Spanish regions, among others,
represented either in a dematerialised form or by certificates.

In the AIAF settlement system, transactions may be settled spot, forward (settlement date more than five days
after the relevant trade date), with a repurchase agreement on a fixed date and double or simultaneous
transactions (two trades in opposite directions with different settlement dates).

The settlement system used for securities admitted for trading in AIAF is the Model 1 delivery versus payment
system, as per the classification of the Bank for International Settlements: that is, it is a “transaction-totransaction” cash and securities settlement system with simultaneity in its finality.

Transactions are settled on the stock-exchange business day agreed by participants at the moment of the trade.

### Euroclear and Clearstream

Investors who do not have, directly or indirectly through their participating entities (custodians), a participating
securities account with Iberclear or their participating entities may hold their investment in the Notes through
bridge accounts maintained by each of Euroclear Bank SA/NV and Clearstream Banking, S.A. with
participating entities in Iberclear.

On the basis of the issue price of the Notes of 99.714% of their principal amount, the annual yield of the Notes
is for the period from (and including) the Issue Date to (but excluding) the Reset Date is 3.185%. This yield
was calculated on the Issue Date and is not an indication of future yield.

### Clearing: ISIN and Common Code

Notes bear the ISIN ES0280907025 and the common code 243435269.

### Listing

This Prospectus has been approved by the CNMV as competent authority under the Prospectus Regulation. The
CNMV has only approved this Prospectus as meeting the standards of completeness, comprehensibility and
consistency imposed by the Prospectus Regulation, and such approval should not be considered as an
endorsement of the Bank or the quality of the Notes that are the subject of this Prospectus. Investors should
make their own assessment as to the suitability of investing in the Notes.

Application has been made for the Notes to be admitted to trading on AIAF. AIAF is a regulated market for the
purposes of MiFID II.

### Paying agency

All payments under the Conditions will be carried out directly by Unicaja Banco through Iberclear. The
corporate address of Iberclear is Plaza de la Lealtad 1, 28014 Madrid, Spain.

### Ratings

The Notes are rated BB by Fitch.

In accordance with Fitch’s ratings definitions, a rating of “BB” indicates an elevated vulnerability to default
risk, particularly in the event of adverse changes in business or economic conditions over time; however,
business or financial flexibility exists that supports the servicing of financial commitments.

### Stabilisation

In connection with the issue of the Notes, HSBC Continental Europe (the “Stabilisation Manager(s)”) (or
persons acting on behalf of any Stabilisation Manager(s)) may over allot Notes or effect transactions with a
view to supporting the market price of the Notes at a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail.
However, stabilisation may not necessarily occur. Any stabilisation action may begin on or after the date on
which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offer of the Notes is made and, if begun, may cease at any
time, but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the issue date of the Notes and 60 days after the
date of the allotment of the Notes. Any stabilisation action or over allotment must be conducted by the relevant
Stabilisation Manager(s) (or person(s) acting on behalf of any Stabilisation Manager(s)) in accordance with
Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on market abuse
(Market Abuse Regulation) and any other applicable laws and rules.

### Interests of natural and legal persons involved in the offer of the Notes

So far as Unicaja Banco is aware, no person involved in the offer of the Notes had an interest, including a
conflict of interest, material to the offer.

### Other relationships

Certain Joint Lead Managers and their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in investment
banking and/or commercial banking transactions with, and may perform services for, Unicaja Banco and its
affiliates in the ordinary course of business. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the

A46786082

148


-----

Joint Lead Managers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt
and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their
own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve
securities and/or instruments of Unicaja Banco or its affiliates. Certain Joint Lead Managers or their affiliates
that have a lending relationship with Unicaja Banco routinely hedge their credit exposure to Unicaja Banco
consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Joint Lead Managers and their
affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit
default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities, including potentially the Notes issued under the
Prospectus. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of Notes issued under the
Prospectus. The Joint Lead Managers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or
publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may
hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

### Expenses related to the admission to trading

to the admission to trading is as follows:
