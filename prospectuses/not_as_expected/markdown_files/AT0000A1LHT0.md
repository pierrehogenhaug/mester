**EURO 2,000,000,000 DEBT ISSUANCE PROGRAMME**

NOVOMATIC AG ("NOVOMATIC AG" or the "Issuer" and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the

"NOVOMATIC AG Group" or the "Group") can issue unsecured, unconditional and unsubordinated notes (the "Notes")
under this debt issuance programme (the "Programme") in any currency agreed between the Issuer and the relevant Dealer
(as defined below). The total principal amount of Notes outstanding under the Programme may not at any time exceed
EUR 2,000,000,000. Notes will be issued in tranches (each a "Tranche" or "Tranche of Notes"), each Tranche consisting of
Notes which are identical in all respects. One or more Tranches, which are expressed to be consolidated and form a single
series and are identical in all respects, but may have different issue dates, interest commencement dates, reoffer prices, issue
prices and dates for first interest payments may form a series ("Series") of Notes. Further Notes may be issued as part of an
existing Series. The specific terms of each Tranche will be determined at the time of offering of such Tranche based on then
prevailing market conditions and will be set forth in the applicable final terms (the "Final Terms") (the form of which is
contained herein). Each Series will be represented by a global note, without interest coupons.
The Issuer is assigned a long-term issuer rating of "BBB" with stable outlook and a short-term issuer rating of "A-2" with
stable outlook by Standard & Poor’s Credit Market Services Europe Limited ("Standard & Poor’s"). The Notes to be issued
under the Programme may be rated or unrated. Where Notes are rated, such rating will be specified in the relevant Final
Terms.
The Issuer will apply for the admission of the Programme to the Second Regulated Market (Geregelter Freiverkehr) of the
Vienna Stock Exchange. This prospectus (the "Prospectus") is valid in regards to Notes issued and to be listed on the Vienna
Stock Exchange within a period of 12 months from the date of approval of this Prospectus. The Programme also allows the
issuance of Notes listed on other regulated (subject to the prior notification of the Prospectus in accordance with Article 18 of
Directive 2003/71/EC, as amended (the "Prospectus Directive"), and approval for listing) and unregulated markets within
the European Economic Area or not listed on any stock exchange, as indicated in the respective Final Terms.

**_Prospective investors should consider that an investment in the Notes includes diverse risks, which are described in more_**

**_detail in Section II. (Risk Factors) starting on page 1. The occurrence of one or more of such risks could lead investors to_**

**_lose some or all of their investment. Each investor should consult its own professional investment, legal, tax and other_**

**_relevant advisors in connection with the subscription of Notes._**

This Prospectus is a base prospectus in accordance with Article 5.4 of the Prospectus Directive, which was prepared in line
with requirements of the Prospectus Directive, Annexes IV, V, XXII and XXX of Commission Regulation 809/2004/EC, as
amended (the "Prospectus Regulation") and the Austrian Capital Markets Act 1991, as amended (the "KMG"). The
Prospectus was submitted to the Austrian Financial Market Authority (the "FMA"), was approved by the FMA and was made
available free of charge as of 5 September 2016 at the registered office of the Issuer at Wiener Straße 158, 2352
Gumpoldskirchen, Austria and in electronic form on the website of the Issuer

(www.novomatic.com/debtissuanceprogramme2016).
The Notes issued under the Programme are subject to Austrian law.
The Issuer has requested that the FMA provide the competent authority of the Federal Republic of Germany with a certificate
of approval attesting that the Prospectus has been drawn up in accordance with the KMG, which implements the Prospectus
Directive into Austrian law (a "Notification"). The Issuer may at any time request the FMA to provide other competent
authorities with a Notification.
This Prospectus is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase the Notes in any country in which such an offer
or solicitation of an offer would be unlawful. In particular, the Notes have not been and will not be registered under the
United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and are subject to United States tax law
requirements. Subject to certain exceptions, Notes may not be offered, sold or delivered within the United States of America
or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act ("Regulation S")
unless the Notes are registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act is available.

and Conditions and Final Terms in this Prospectus, in German language constitutes a translation for additional
information. In respect of the issue of any Tranche of Notes under the Programme, the German text of the Terms
and Conditions and Final Terms in this Prospectus will be controlling and binding.

**This Prospectus may only be used for the purpose for which it has been published. This Prospectus and**
**any Final Terms may not be used for the purpose of an offer or solicitation by anyone in any jurisdiction**
**in which such offer or solicitation is not authorised or to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such**
**an offer or solicitation. This Prospectus, any supplement thereto and any Final Terms do not constitute an**
**offer or an invitation to subscribe for or purchase any Notes.**

**Neither this Prospectus nor any Final Terms nor any further information supplied in connection with the**
**Programme or the Notes constitute an offer or an invitation to subscribe for or purchase any Notes. Each**
**investor contemplating purchasing Notes should make its own independent investigation of the financial**
**condition and affairs, and its own appraisal of the creditworthiness, of the Issuer.**

**In connection with the issue of any Tranche of Notes, the Dealer or Dealers (if any) named as the**
**stabilising manager(s) (or persons acting on behalf of any stabilising manger(s)) in the applicable Final**
**Terms may over-allot Notes or effect transactions with a view to supporting the price of the Notes at a**
**level higher than that which might otherwise prevail. However, there is no assurance that the stabilising**
**manager(s) (or persons acting on behalf of a stabilizing manager) will undertake stabilisation action. Any**
**stabilisation action may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms and**
**conditions of the offer of the relevant Tranche of Notes is made and, if begun, may be ended at any time,**
**but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the issue date of the relevant Tranche and 60 days**
**after the date of the allotment of the relevant Tranche of Notes. Any stabilisation action or overallotment**
**must be conducted by the relevant stabilising manager(s) (or person(s) acting on behalf of any stabilising**
**manager(s)) in accordance with all applicable laws and rules. Each Dealer and/or each further financial**
**intermediary subsequently reselling or finally placing Notes issued under the Programme is entitled to use**
**the Prospectus as set out in "Consent to use the Prospectus" below.**

**Each Dealer and/or each further financial intermediary subsequently reselling or finally placing Notes**
**issued under the Programme is entitled to use the Prospectus as set out in "Consent to use the Prospectus"**
**below.**

**INFORMATION REGARDING FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

Certain numbers (including percentages) in this Prospectus were commercially rounded. In tables, such
commercially rounded numbers may not add up exactly to the totals presented in such tables. The percentages
provided refer to the commercially rounded financial information in this Prospectus and may therefore deviate
from the actual values in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Interim Financial Statements.

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This Prospectus contains certain forward-looking statements. A forward-looking statement is a statement that
does not relate to historical facts and events. They are based on analyses or forecasts of future results and
estimates of amounts not yet determinable or foreseeable. These forward-looking statements are identified by the
use of terms and phrases such as "anticipate", "believe", "could", "estimate", "expect", "intend", "may", "plan",
"predict", "project", "will" and similar terms and phrases, including references and assumptions.

This applies, in particular, to statements in this Prospectus containing information on future earning capacity,
plans and expectations regarding NOVOMATIC AG's business and management, its growth and profitability,
and general economic and regulatory conditions and other factors that affect it.

Forward-looking statements in this Prospectus are based on current estimates and assumptions that the Issuer
makes to the best of its present knowledge. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties
and other factors which could cause actual results, including NOVOMATIC AG's financial condition and results
of operations, to differ materially from and be worse than results that have expressly or implicitly been assumed


-----

or described in these forward-looking statements. NOVOMATIC AG's business is also subject to a number of
risks and uncertainties that could cause a forward-looking statement, estimate or prediction in this Prospectus to
become inaccurate. Accordingly, investors are strongly advised to read the following sections of this Prospectus:
"Summary", "Risk Factors" and "Information regarding the Issuer and the Group". These sections include more
detailed descriptions of factors that might have an impact on NOVOMATIC AG's business and the markets in
which it operates.

In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, future events described in this Prospectus may not occur.
Neither the Issuer nor its management or the Dealers can vouch for the future veracity of the opinions contained
in the Prospectus or for the actual occurrence of the forecast developments. Moreover, prospective investors
should note that statements regarding past trends and developments provide no guarantee that such trends and
developments will continue in the future.

In addition, neither the Issuer nor the Dealers assume any obligation, except as required by law, to update any
forward-looking statement or to conform these forward-looking statements to actual events or developments.

**THIRD-PARTY STATEMENTS**

Where information was sourced from a third party, the Issuer confirms that this information was accurately
reproduced and that as far as the Issuer is aware and is able to ascertain from information published by that third
party, no facts were omitted which would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. Where
such information was included in this Prospectus, the source is indicated.

The Issuer is the parent company of the NOVOMATIC AG
Group. As a holding company, the Issuer has no business
operations as such but is responsible for the management of
and for support functions for the Group. The Issuer is thus, to
a certain degree, dependent upon dividend payments to be
made by its subsidiaries.

Group and is itself not operationally active but responsible
for the management of and for support functions of the
NOVOMATIC AG Group.

The NOVOMATIC AG Group develops, manufactures, sells
and rents gaming products and operates approximately 1,600
gaming and betting facilities and 60,000 gaming machines (as
of June 2016 compared to 1,400 gaming and betting and
47,000 gaming machines as of 31 December 2015). Besides

provider of casino management systems and online

monitoring systems, local or central game result

determination including direct interface to state authorities,
content provider of games for licensed online and offline
providers as well as an operator of online gaming platforms.

The NOVOMATIC AG Group exports its products to
approximately 80 countries all over the world. Germany,
Austria, Italy, Latvia, Great Britain, Croatia, Romania,
Macedonia, Spain and the Netherlands are among the target
markets in the segment Gaming Operations.

**B. 16 Control:** The Issuer forms part of the NOVOMATIC Group.

which are NOVO Invest GmbH (which holds a 89.96% stake
in the Issuer), ACE Casino Holding AG and Gryphon Invest
AG (which holds an 10.04% stake in the Issuer), in each of
such three parent companies, Professor Johann F. Graf is the
direct sole shareholder.

Through the ownership of the majority shareholder of the

the owner is able, taking into account provisions of the law
and of the articles of association, to set the business policies
of the Issuer and control important business decisions.

Dividendenzahlungen ihrer Tochtergesellschaften abhängig.


**B. 15 Haupttätigkeiten der Emittentin:** Die Emittentin ist die übergeordnete Gesellschaft des

jeweiliger (direkter oder indirekter) Alleinaktionär Herr Prof.
Johann F. Graf ist.

Durch die Konzentration des Anteilseigentums und die im
Aufsichtsrat bestellten Kapitalvertreter ist der Eigentümer des
Hauptaktionärs unter Berücksichtigung der gesetzlichen und
satzungsmäßigen Vorgaben in der Lage, die allgemeinen

Grundsätze der Geschäftspolitik der Emittentin zu bestimmen und
wichtige unternehmerische Entscheidungen zu kontrollieren.

**B. 17 Ratings:** Die Emittentin hat ein Langzeit-Emittentenrating von "BBB" mit
stabilem Ausblick und ein Kurzzeit-Emittentenrating von "A-2"
mit stabilem Ausblick von Standard & Poor's Credit Market
Services Europe Limited ("Standard & Poor's").

Generell dürfen regulierte Investoren in der Europäischen Union
für regulatorische Zwecke kein Rating verwenden, das nicht von
einer in der Europäischen Union ansässigen und unter der
Verordnung (EG) Nr 1060/2009 des Europäischen Parlaments
und des Rates vom 16. September 2009, in ihrer jeweils geltenden
Fassung ("CRA Verordnung"), registrierten Kreditratingagentur
erstellt wurde, ausgenommen Ratings einer Kreditratingagentur,
die in der Europäischen Union schon vor dem 7. Juni 2010 tätig
war und einen Antrag auf Registrierung gemäß der CRA
Verordnung gestellt hat, der nicht abgewiesen wird.

United Kingdom E14 5LH und ist eine Geschäftseinheit von The
McGraw-Hill Companies Inc. Mit dem Hauptsitz an der

Geschäftsanschrift 1221 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY
10020. Standard & Poor's vergibt langfristige Bonitätsratings auf
einer Skala von "AAA" bis "D". Die Ratings von "AA" bis
"CCC" können durch ein "+" oder "-" modifiziert werden, um die
relative Position innerhalb der Hauptratingklasse anzugeben.
Standard & Poor's kann darüber hinaus eine Einschätzung
(genannt Credit Watch) abgeben, ob ein Rating in naher Zukunft
voraussichtlich ein Upgrade (positiv) erhält, ein Downgrade
(negativ) erhält oder ob die Tendenz ungewiss ist (neutral).
Standard & Poor's weist spezifischen Emissionen kurzfristige
Ratings auf einer Skala von "A-1", "A-2", "A-3", "B", "C" bis
hinab zu "D" zu. Innerhalb der Klasse "A-1" kann das Rating mit
einem "+" versehen werden.

der Europäischen Union ansässig und ist als registrierte

Ratingagentur auf der von der Europäischen Wertpapier- und
Marktaufsichtsbehörde (ESMA) auf ihrer Webseite gemäß CRA

**E.** **Angebot**

**E. 2.B. Gründe für das Angebot und**

Zweckbestimmung der Erlöse:


Erwerbsvorgängen von Schuldverschreibungen über

Clearingsysteme.

- Risiken aufgrund eines inaktiven oder illiquiden Handels der
Schuldverschreibungen.

- Die Emittentin oder die Platzeure können Transaktionen
tätigen, die nicht im Interesse der Anleihegläubiger sind,
oder es kann aus anderen Gründen zu Interessenkonflikten
zwischen der Emittentin, den Platzeuren und den

Anleihegläubigern kommen.

- Anleihegläubiger sind bei Verkauf der

Schuldverschreibungen einem Marktpreisrisiko ausgesetzt.

- Anleihegläubiger sind dem Risiko ausgesetzt, dass die
Emittentin weiteres Fremdkapital aufnimmt.

- Steuerliche Rahmenbedingungen könnten negative

Auswirkungen für Anleihegläubiger haben.

- Risiken bestehen aufgrund einer möglichen strukturellen
Nachrangigkeit der Schuldverschreibungen gegenüber

anderen von der Emittentin und deren Tochtergesellschaften
aufgenommenen Finanzierungen.

- Anleihegläubiger von Schuldverschreibungen in einer

Währung, die eine fremde Währung für einen solchen
Anleihegläubiger ist, könnten möglicherweise einer

wesentlichen Veränderung des Wechselkurses ausgesetzt
sein wodurch die Rendite solcher Schuldverschreibungen
wesentlich beeinflusst werden könnte.

die reale Rendite verringert.

- Risiken im Zusammenhang mit der Bestellung eines

Kurators für die Inhaber von Schuldverschreibungen.

verjähren, sofern sie nicht binnen dreißig Jahren (hinsichtlich
Kapital) und binnen drei Jahren (hinsichtlich Zinsen) geltend
gemacht werden.

- Die Platzeure können unter gewissen Voraussetzungen von
einer beabsichtigten Emission der Schuldverschreibungen
zurücktreten.

**II.** **RISK FACTORS**

_The Issuer believes that the following factors may affect its ability to fulfil its obligations under Notes issued_
_under the Programme. In addition, factors which may be relevant for the purpose of assessing market risks_
_associated with Notes issued under the Programme are also described below. Prospective purchasers of the_
_Notes should note that the risks described below are not the only risks the Issuer or the NOVOMATIC AG Group_
_may face. The Issuer has described only those risks relating to its business, operations, financial condition or_
_prospects that it considers to be material and of which it is currently aware. There may be additional risks that_
_the Issuer currently considers not to be material or of which it is not currently aware. Should one or several of_
_the following risks materialise, this could lead to a material decline in the price of the Notes or, in the worst-_
_case scenario, to a total loss of interest and the amount invested by investors._

**_Every investor is advised to consult with their own professional advisers regarding investment, legal, tax, and_**
**_other matters in connection with any subscription of the Issuer’s Notes. The information contained in this_**
**_Prospectus and the risk disclosures below cannot take the place of professional advice._**

_The risk factors set forth below concern both the Issuer and the NOVOMATIC AG Group._

_Terms that have been defined in the Terms and Conditions or elsewhere in this Prospectus shall have the same_
_meaning in this chapter._

**1.** **Risk Factors regarding the NOVOMATIC AG Group**

**_The NOVOMATIC AG Group’s business depends upon general economic conditions._**

With respect to its business activities, the NOVOMATIC AG Group is exposed to the risk of any deterioration in
the general economic conditions as well as to economic fluctuations. In recent years, the global economy was
negatively affected by the financial and economic crisis, which led to high volatility in the capital markets and
had an adverse effect on the real economy. The worldwide economic outlook remains uncertain.

Some of the markets in which the NOVOMATIC AG Group conducts its business have or are experiencing an
economic downturn that is coupled with negative GDP-growth, continuously high unemployment and losses in
real income. The persistence of this negative economic climate worldwide and/or the occurrence of similarly
negative macroeconomic developments impede growth and stable development in those countries where the
NOVOMATIC AG Group is active.

Increased volatility in international capital markets as well as other negative macroeconomic developments may
cause a deterioration of the general economic parameters in those countries where the NOVOMATIC AG Group
does business and thus may have an adverse effect on demand for gaming and betting industry products and
services that the NOVOMATIC AG Group develops and offers.

Any deterioration in the economic environment, further losses in the given population’s real income, increasing
and/or continued high unemployment rates and the attendant reduction in gamers’ gaming and betting
expenditures and/or lower investment volumes by customers with respect to purchases of new products or the
services of the NOVOMATIC AG Group or other negative macroeconomic developments might have an adverse
effect on the Issuer’s financial position, cash flows and financial performance.

**_The expansion into new markets or into new product or service areas could be unsuccessful and thus the_**
**_success of the NOVOMATIC AG Group's strategy is uncertain._**

Diversifying its business in terms of both geography and products by entering into markets and segments that
offer significant future potential is a central part of the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s strategy. As part of its
strategic development, the NOVOMATIC AG Group plans to take its business activities to new countries and
regions and to further expand in its current markets with existing and newly developed products and services. All
of this requires substantial resources, in addition to investments. If the anticipated growth in these countries and
regions does not materialize at all or only to a limited extent or if the NOVOMATIC AG Group fails wholly or
partly to successfully implement its strategy due to legal requirements, regulatory developments or among other
things, any such failure might have an adverse effect on the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s financial position, cash
flows and financial performance.

In particular, the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s activities are subject to antitrust and competition laws and
regulations. Competition authorities may prohibit the NOVOMATIC AG Group from acquiring certain target


-----

companies or, alternatively, may require the prior disposition of certain assets or other remedies before
approving a particular acquisition. This is, for instance, the case with respect to the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s
intended acquisition of direct and indirect ownership interests in Casinos Austria. On 26 August 2016, following
the review pursuant to the Phase II request, the Cartel Court issued a prohibition decision, which decision was
received by NOVOMATIC AG Group on 30 August 2016. In its decision, the Cartel Court did not approve an
acquisition of more than 25% of direct and indirect stakes in Casinos Austria and Austrian Lotteries, thereby
preventing the completion of the Casinos Austria Transactions. NOVOMATIC AG Group intends to appeal the
Cartel Court Decision.

In addition, competition authorities may retroactively scrutinize transactions already concluded by the
NOVOMATIC AG Group. Moreover, as the NOVOMATIC AG Group grows, it may become increasingly
difficult to meet the requirements of antitrust and competition regulations when pursuing acquisition targets in
the future. In addition to antitrust and competition authorities, the NOVOMATIC AG Group is also subject to
the decisions of gaming authorities in the various markets in which it operates or plans to operate. Local gaming
authorities may, among other things, refuse to grant required gaming licenses or impose restrictions or
obligations that make it difficult for the NOVOMATIC AG Group to conduct its business or expand its
operations in such markets. Should the NOVOMATIC AG Group, as a consequence of the foregoing, not be able
to implement its development plans at all or only to a limited extent in such markets, this could ultimately have
an adverse effect on the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s financial position, cash flows and financial performance.

**_The NOVOMATIC AG Group faces risks in connection with future acquisitions, joint ventures and_**
**_investments._**

NOVOMATIC AG Group may consider selected acquisition opportunities, enter into joint ventures or undertake
investments or disinvestments in a targeted manner. There can be no assurance that NOVOMATIC AG Group
will be able to identify suitable targets and consummate an acquisition or enter into joint ventures or investments
on favorable terms or at all. It is also possible that not all material risks in connection with acquisitions or the
establishment of joint ventures will be identified in the due diligence process and that such risks will not be taken
into account in the decision-making process or respective agreements to a sufficient level or at all. As a result,
the NOVOMATIC AG Group may expend a significant amount of money for the acquisition of a company
whose actual value does not justify such expenditure and whose liabilities and future performance may adversely
affect the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s financial position, cash flows and financial performance.

The NOVOMATIC AG Group has made numerous investments and acquisitions in the past, and it continually
evaluates potential future investments. The success of such investments and acquisitions with respect to
achievement of the expected expansion and profitability is uncertain. For instance, suitable target companies
may not be available at all for acquisitions in the given markets or only at terms that are not financially viable.
Even if such target companies were available, there might be the risk that the NOVOMATIC AG Group cannot
raise the required funding for the given acquisition or that the acquired target company cannot be successfully
integrated into the NOVOMATIC AG Group. Integration entails various risks regarding employees, processes,
IT, logistics and other systems, as well as product offerings, among others. Integration may be a complex, time
consuming and expensive process involving a number of uncertainties. These include the costs and expenses
associated with unexpected difficulties, the diversion of management’s attention from daily operations and/or
strategic business decisions, the potential loss of key employees, difficulties in complying with regulatory
requirements and the additional demands on management related to the increase in the size and scope of
operations following an acquisition. Even if integration is successful, it may not result in the realization of the
full synergies, cost savings, revenue and cash flow enhancements, operational efficiencies and other expected
benefits. Among other things, the strategy of the NOVOMATIC AG Group is based on a variety of assumptions
and expectations that may turn out to be inaccurate and/or do not materialize as anticipated. The occurrence of
such risks might have an adverse effect on the Issuer’s financial position, cash flows and financial performance.

In particular, as regards intended acquisition of direct and indirect ownership interests in Casinos Austria Group
and assuming that such acquisitions are ultimately permitted and completed, the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s
level of indebtedness may increase which could adversely affect the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s financial
position, cash flows and financial performance. Furthermore, no member of the Casinos Austria Group, except
for its Australian listed subsidiary, Reef Casino Trust, is a publicly listed company with shares trading on a
regulated market and, in connection with the acquisition transactions, the NOVOMATIC AG Group was not in a
position to conduct a full legal or financial due diligence of either Casinos Austria or its indirect subsidiary
Austrian Lotteries. It is therefore also possible that not all material risks in connection with the acquisition of
Casinos Austria Group have been identified and that such risks will not be (sufficiently or at all) taken into
account in the decision-making process or the respective agreements relating to the share acquisitions. As a


-----

result, the NOVOMATIC AG Group may expend a significant amount of money for the acquisition of a
company whose actual value does not justify such expenditure and whose liabilities and future performance may
adversely affect the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s financial position, cash flows and financial performance.

Moreover, the NOVOMATIC AG Group entered into a term sheet agreement with SAZKA Group A.S. and
Austrian Gaming Holding A.S., both of which are Czech companies (the "SAZKA Group"), on the terms to be
agreed upon in a joint venture agreement relating to the holding of their respective direct and indirect stakes in
Casinos Austria and Austrian Lotteries. The joint venture would serve as the holding entity of the joint venture
partners’ current and future interests in Casinos Austria and Austrian Lotteries. As part of the joint venture, both
NOVOMATIC AG Group and SAZKA Group would be equal partners, each holding a 50% stake in the
envisaged joint venture. The establishment of the joint venture is subject to various conditions precedents which
included, among others, the completion of the Casinos Austria Transactions, the signing of a joint venture
agreement, approval by the competition authorities and various domestic and international regulatory bodies,
non-exercise of rights of first refusal by shareholders, approval by required shareholders’ meetings as well as the
non-expiry of the long stop date on 31 December 2018.

Should the NOVOMATIC AG Group be unsuccessful in its appeal of the Cartel Court’s prohibition decision and
thus unable to complete the Casinos Austria Transactions, claims by the sellers against the NOVOMATIC AG
Group cannot be excluded.

Furthermore, NOVOMATIC AG has entered into an agreement for the purchase of approximately 53% of the
issued shares of the Australian publicly listed company Ainsworth Game Technology Limited ("Ainsworth GT
**Limited"), a leading producer and provider of gaming solutions with operations in Australasia, South East Asia**
and North and South America, from Leonard H. Ainsworth for approximately 473 million Australian dollars. In
addition to the various acquisition-related risks described above, NOVOMATIC AG would, as majority owner
of an Australian publicly listed company, also be subject to Australian securities laws applicable to its dealings
with Ainsworth GT Limited, which could make it more difficult to implement its envisioned strategy regarding
Ainsworth GT Limited. If NOVOMATIC AG Group cannot successfully implement such strategy, this could
have a negative impact on Ainsworth GT Limited’s business and, ultimately, could have an adverse effect on the
Issuer’s financial position, cash flows and financial performance.

**_Risks due to shareholder concentration._**

NOVO Invest GmbH, whose sole shareholder is Professor Johann F. Graf, directly owns 89.96% of the Issuer’s
shares. The remaining 10.04% of the Issuer’s shares are held by Gryphon Invest AG, Appenzell, Switzerland,
whose sole shareholder is also Professor Johann F. Graf. This majority stake enables NOVO Invest GmbH, and
thus indirectly Professor Johann F. Graf, to control the actions of the Issuer including the following, among
others: the appointment of the members of the supervisory board and thus indirectly the appointment of the
Issuer’s management board members; the timing and amount of dividend payments; determination of the annual
budget; decisions regarding any increase of the capital stock; or consent to amendments of the Issuer’s articles of
association. The interests of NOVO Invest GmbH, and indirectly those of Professor Johann F. Graf may
contradict those of the Issuer and might have an adverse effect on the Issuer’s financial position, cash flows and
financial performance.

**_The Issuer's ability to service its liabilities is limited on account of its character as a holding company._**

The Issuer is a holding company that has no material assets aside from intangible assets, fixed assets, equity
interests in subsidiaries, and/or other companies as well as receivables from subsidiaries and/or other companies.
In order to pay its liabilities to creditors, in general, as well as its liabilities to the Noteholders, in particular, the
Issuer in its capacity as a holding company depends especially on inflows of liquidity (e.g. dividend payments)
and profits from its subsidiaries or from companies in which the NOVOMATIC AG Group has an equity
interest. If the subsidiaries’ financial condition were to deteriorate, the Issuer might have to make funds available
to subsidiaries that are experiencing financial difficulties; this might, in turn, negatively impact the Issuer’s own
financial strength. Any deterioration in the financial condition of a subsidiary might also mean that it may not be
able to pay its liabilities to the Issuer. Moreover, if any subsidiary were to file for insolvency, its creditors, which
could include the Issuer, would be entitled to the subsidiary’s assets and the Issuer would only be able to avail
itself of remaining proceeds, if any, after satisfaction of all of the subsidiary’s creditors. Furthermore, under
applicable law the Issuer’s claims against a subsidiary might be treated as subordinated liabilities in the event of
the subsidiary’s insolvency. The occurrence of any of these circumstances could have material adverse effects on
the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s financial position, cash flows and financial performance.


-----

**2.** **Risk factors associated with the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s business activities**

**_The economic success of the NOVOMATIC AG Group is dependent upon its management and key staff._**

The performance of the NOVOMATIC AG Group is dependent on the knowledge and expertise of its nonexecutive staff and its Management. If one or more of its key employees or members of the Management were to
resign, there is the risk that the NOVOMATIC AG Group would be unable to recruit individuals who possess the
required and comparable skills and know-how and are qualified to deal with business challenges within a
reasonable time and at market conditions. This might have an adverse effect on the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s
net assets, financial position and results of operations.

**_The NOVOMATIC AG Group is dependent upon technology systems and relies on technologies and advanced_**
**_IT systems that might fail, suffer interferences or become subject to illegal attacks and fraudulent activities._**

The NOVOMATIC AG Group works in a highly technological business environment, where new technologies
are developed or utilized in short innovation cycles. There is the risk that the NOVOMATIC AG Group may not
identify, develop and/or implement required innovative technologies in time or at all. The integrity, reliability,
and operational performance of the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s IT systems are indispensable to the Group’s
business. The IT systems may be damaged, disrupted, or otherwise impaired due to technical or human failures,
or natural disasters. However, illegal attacks, fraudulent manipulation—e.g. on account of cyber criminality—or
security vulnerabilities (such as “Heartbleed”, the well-known software bug, usually causing huge damage) may
also damage, disrupt, or otherwise impair the IT systems (hardware and software). Any interference with the IT
systems might result in extensive business problems and force the NOVOMATIC AG Group to utilize
considerable financial and expert human resources to correct those problems. This might have an adverse effect
on the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s financial position, cash flows and financial performance.

**_The NOVOMATIC AG Group is subject to bookmaker's risk._**

Bookmakers and totalisators cannot anticipate the outcome of betting events ahead of time. A bookmaker is an
individual who determines the odds of a bet based on considerations of probability as well as personal and
topical considerations. A totalisator is a person or machine that accepts bets and wagers and retains a
commission. The sum of the wagers less the commission is gathered in a pool and distributed to those
participants whose bets correspond to the outcome of the given betting event, as a win. In this case, the prize is
not determined until the betting on the given event has closed, i.e. until no more bets are accepted for the event.
The betting odds are determined based on historical data using statistical methods. This means that losses cannot
be precluded. In particular, unforeseen losses may also arise when the outcome of betting events is manipulated
by third-party fraud (betting fraud). This might have an adverse effect on the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s
financial position, cash flows and financial performance.

**_Risks in connection with pathological gaming, lawsuits brought by gamers, lawsuits brought by competitors_**
**_or other legal proceedings._**

The Issuer or its subsidiaries are from time to time sued in the regular course of business for repayment of stakes
and bets made in connection with pathological gaming—for example, a behavioral addiction that is classified as
gaming under abnormal habits and impulse control disorders—especially if it leads to the given player’s
incapacity. Furthermore, the NOVOMATIC AG Group is from time to time exposed to litigation in connection
with the conclusion of gaming and betting contracts due to alleged noncompliance with gamer protections or
other requirements, lawsuits arising from violations of anti-trust rules and regulations or claims for damages by
competitors. Moreover, if, under particular circumstances, a gamer successfully sues the NOVOMATIC AG
Group, this could lead to a significant number of follow-on suits by a similar class of gamers respectively class
action lawsuits by a coordinated group of gamers and/or consumer protection organizations. An increase in the
costs or detrimental effects from litigation might have an adverse effect on the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s
financial position, cash flows and financial performance.

In the context of legal proceeding and/or settlement agreements, including ancillary or related proceedings, a
decision in favor of the NOVOMATIC AG Group or any settlement agreement may subsequently be challenged,
revoked or proceedings could be reopened. This might have an adverse effect on the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s
financial position, cash flows and financial performance.


-----

**_The NOVOMATIC AG Group might suffer losses due to technical defects, illegal attacks or fraudulent_**
**_manipulation._**

The performance of the NOVOMATIC AG Group is highly dependent on its ability to identify and prevent
fraudulent manipulation or illegal attacks—using technical means among other things—on its products or
services and related processes and procedures. Any events that expose products or services as well as related
processes and procedures of the NOVOMATIC AG Group to technical defects, fraudulent activities, or illegal
attacks might impair the reputation of the NOVOMATIC AG Group and/or cause customers and business
partners to give their preference to competitors’ products or services; the NOVOMATIC AG Group itself might
be affected with respect to its own operating gaming and betting business. This might cause the NOVOMATIC
AG Group to incur losses, expose it to claims for damages, or result in the withdrawal of licenses/concessions by
the competent authorities. Technical defects, illegal attacks or fraudulent activities might also greatly undermine
the ability of the NOVOMATIC AG Group to manufacture its products or offer its services. Any inability of the
NOVOMATIC AG Group to achieve its production goals or offer its services and thus serve its customers or
render its services would have a substantially negative impact on its reputation and sales.

The NOVOMATIC AG Group is also exposed to the risk of temporary or ongoing business interruptions due to
internal manipulations such as employee fraud. Any such wrongdoing might force the NOVOMATIC AG Group
to discontinue certain business activities or close certain business premises, temporarily or permanently, pursuant
to governmental orders. Insurance policies against wrongdoing by staff members might not be sufficient or
available.

Any such events thus might have an adverse effect on the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s financial position, cash
flows and financial performance.

**_The NOVOMATIC AG Group is exposed to the risk of suffering an image loss._**

The reputation of the NOVOMATIC AG Group and its brands is largely determined by the image and perception
of the gaming and betting industry, the behavior of all stakeholders involved, as well as the perception of them.
To a significant extent, the reputation of the NOVOMATIC AG Group and its brands is also determined by the
behavior of the Group’s business partners, staff, and competitors. Any wrongdoing by actors in the gaming and
betting industry or any negative reports in the press might lead to a loss of reputation, intensified regulatory
action, and changed legal parameters; subsequently, this might also entail the loss of funding from banks, which
have largely financed the NOVOMATIC AG Group to date, and/or to the loss of licenses/concessions. This
might have an adverse effect on the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s financial position, cash flows and financial
performance.

**_Risks due to product liability or product defects._**

Under applicable product liability laws, the NOVOMATIC AG Group might be held liable for damages caused
by defective products. There is also the risk that third parties might bring claims against the Issuer or an
affiliated company on account of unexpected product defects. This might put financial pressure on the Issuer
unless such claims are precluded by contractual means. Any failure to replace defective products in a timely
manner or at all might also trigger contractual penalties (e.g. interruptions of gaming platforms) and, as result, a
decline in the sales revenues and or earnings of the Issuer or a NOVOMATIC AG Group company. In turn, this
might have an adverse effect on the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s financial position, cash flows and financial
performance.

**_The NOVOMATIC AG Group’s production is dependent upon the availability of high-quality raw materials_**
**_and semi-finished products._**

The manufacturing activities of the NOVOMATIC AG Group are dependent on the availability of high quality
raw materials and semi-finished products such as flat screens, bank note checkers, ticket printers,
microprocessors, and metal casing. Any shortage of stocks or any increase in demand might trigger raw material
cost increases as well as manufacturing problems or interruptions, which in turn might cause delivery problems
for the NOVOMATIC AG Group and could have an adverse effect on the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s financial
position, cash flows and financial performance.

**_NOVOMATIC AG Group depends on a limited number of suppliers._**

The NOVOMATIC AG Group procures a substantial portion of its raw materials and semi-finished products
from a limited number of suppliers. Any inability on the part of these suppliers to deliver their goods on time or


-----

at all might possibly force the NOVOMATIC AG Group to search for more expensive alternatives or dispense
production with the given raw materials and goods entirely. This could substantially impair the NOVOMATIC
AG Group’s production capability. Any occurrence of such risks thus could have an adverse effect on the
NOVOMATIC AG Group’s financial position, cash flows and financial performance.

**_The NOVOMATIC AG Group is exposed to the risk of temporary or permanent interruptions of production or_**
**_operation caused by external events; in particular, the production facilities of the NOVOMATIC AG Group_**
**_are exposed to a risk of accidents and failures._**

Some of the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s facilities are located in parts of the world where extreme climatic
conditions prevail, exposing them to an increased risk of natural disasters; terrorist attacks and political unrest
may also occur in these areas. These factors may interfere with the business of the NOVOMATIC AG Group
temporarily or permanently, damage its facilities, or lower the number of its customers in an affected area. The
NOVOMATIC AG Group cannot guarantee that it can purchase comprehensive insurance against such risks.

For reasons of efficiency, the NOVOMATIC AG Group has shifted a substantial portion of its manufacturing
activities to a handful of production facilities all over the world. Manufacturing in these production facilities is
exposed to a multitude of operating risks, including equipment failure, labor shortages, internal accidents, natural
disasters, power outages, and other risks. The occurrence of any such risks might undermine the operations of
the NOVOMATIC AG Group and lead to both financial losses and legal liability. This might have an adverse
effect on the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s financial position, cash flows and financial performance.

**_The NOVOMATIC AG Group does not carry insurance against all risks, and coverage under its insurance_**
**_policies might be insufficient in case of some losses._**

The NOVOMATIC AG Group’s operating business is exposed to multifaceted operating risks such as climatic
conditions, political unrest, terrorist attacks, disruption of power supplies, environmental risks, technical failures,
fire, explosions, floods and earthquakes, or other accidents in the production facilities of the NOVOMATIC AG
Group. Such risks might damage the production facilities of the NOVOMATIC AG Group, cause personal injury
or death, environmental damage, operational interruptions, as well as liability on the part of the NOVOMATIC
AG Group companies.

The NOVOMATIC AG Group is not insured against all of the aforementioned risks, nor can it be guaranteed
that payments, if any, under the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s existent insurance policies will be adequate to cover
any potential damage. The NOVOMATIC AG Group’s net assets, financial position and results of operations
might be adversely affected if the Group had to cover substantial costs itself due to inadequate insurance
coverage.

**_The Issuer's organisation and controlling might fail._**

The multitude of Group companies in different countries requires complex organizational and controlling
structures that also serve to ensure compliance with applicable legal requirements in connection with money
laundering and sanctions or with securities laws pertaining to listed notes. Given the complexity and
international make-up of the NOVOMATIC AG Group, there is the risk that existent controlling tools will not
work at all or not flawlessly and that required measures cannot be implemented completely and on time. This
may include risks associated with the unlawful behavior of staff or business partners, for example, in connection
with corruption and money laundering. Any such events might have adverse effects on the reputation of the
NOVOMATIC AG Group or on the Issuer’s net assets, financial position and results of operations.

**_Risks in connection with changes in customer behaviour._**

Customer behavior is subject to continuous change due to the availability of a diverse range of leisure and
entertainment services. This requires continuous adjustments of the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s products and
services as well as innovations in order to maintain the Group’s position in its target markets. There is the risk
that customer or consumer requests might not be identified on time or at all. Furthermore, there is a trend toward
online gaming and betting, which is displacing gaming and betting in brick-and-mortar gaming and betting
operations, as offered by the NOVOMATIC AG Group. Any further intensification of this trend and the
resulting decline in the number of visitors to the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s brick-and-mortar gaming and
betting operations might have an adverse effect on the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s financial position, cash flows
and financial performance. Furthermore, regarding the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s own offerings in the online
gaming and betting market, it may be exposed to increased competition from new entrants in such market, may
be unable to adequately or timely adjust its product offerings, or may be required to allocate significantly more


-----

resources to its related operations in order to remain competitive. This could, in turn, have an adverse effect on
the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s financial position, cash flows and financial performance.

**_Receivables due from customers and/or business partners may not be collectible and contractual_**
**_counterparties may not fulfil their payment obligations._**

The NOVOMATIC AG Group is exposed to a credit or default risk on the part of customers, business partners,
such as concessionaires, and other counterparties. Such counterparties may be slow to meet their payment
obligations to the NOVOMATIC AG Group or may be financially unable to make such payments at all. Such
payment delays or defaults, or the loss of, or a need to write down, receivables might have a material adverse
effect on the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s financial position, cash flows and financial performance.

**3.** **Legal risks**

**_Risks on account of potential changes in gaming legislation as well as related changes in the tax framework_**
**_in the countries where the NOVOMATIC AG Group operates._**

The NOVOMATIC AG Group operates on the basis of the currently applicable political, economic, legal, and
tax framework in a highly regulated environment that is subject to constant, and sometimes significant, changes
and adjustments. The NOVOMATIC AG Group is exposed to the risk of changes in the statutory, governmental
and tax framework.

Amendments that have already been enacted (e.g. in connection with the German Interstate Treaty on Gambling
(Deutscher Glücksspielstaatsvertrag), the Italian budget law (Stability Law), the Albanian gaming laws, the
Austrian Gaming Act (Glücksspielgesetz) or betting regulations enacted by the Austrian federal states), any
change in administrative practices, or even the possible further prohibition of gaming machines and/or additional
restrictions with respect to gaming or betting machines, either in parts of Austria or in other jurisdictions where
the NOVOMATIC AG Group is active, have long-term effects on the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s operating
activities. For instance, the German Interstate Treaty on Gambling (Deutscher Glücksspielstaatsvertrag) is
expected to result in the significant reduction of the total number of gaming machines permitted to operate in
Germany and thus in a significant decrease of sales revenues from renting gaming machines. In addition, the
recent prohibition of slot machines in Vienna, Austria, required the NOVOMATIC AG Group to decommission
all of these gaming machines operated in Vienna as of 1 January 2015. Also, gaming and betting were outlawed
in both the Russian Federation (with the exception of specially designated zones) and the Ukraine (entire
country) in 2009. In Hungary, a law prohibiting the operation of gaming devices in arcades and pubs was
enacted and implemented in 2012. This not only caused the NOVOMATIC AG Group to lose its business,
because it was prohibited from operating gaming devices, but also resulted in excess supply and related market
distortions in neighbouring countries. Furthermore, amendments to the gaming law in Albania will result in a
discontinuation of the operation of electronic casinos of the NOVOMATIC AG Group by the end of 2016.

Any such changes in the legal framework and/or the application and interpretation of laws might have an adverse
effect on the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s financial position, cash flow and financial performance.

**_Risks on account of dependency upon national licences / authorisations for the operation of gaming and_**
**_betting facilities as well as risks on account of dependency upon production licences, sales licences and_**
**_product licences._**

In those countries where the NOVOMATIC AG Group conducts its business, the operation of gaming and
betting establishments requires a licence, concession, or other kind of governmental permit from the appropriate
government agency. Such licences/concessions are usually granted for limited periods or in the form of limited
licence or concessions agreements. Unless the respective agreement provides a renewal option and provided that
a renewal would be possible at conditions or requirements that are acceptable or reasonable in financial terms,
the NOVOMATIC AG Group would have to commence the process of obtaining a new licence or concession.
The NOVOMATIC AG Group has applied for licences and/or concessions for operating casinos and gaming
halls in Austria, its core market. The NOVOMATIC AG Group cannot guarantee that its participation in such
procedures for obtaining licences or concessions will be successful or that a licence or concession, once granted,
will not be successfully challenged later. Even if such licence or concession is granted and legally effective, it
may remain subject to extraordinary appeals, such as in the case of the recent Highest Administrative Court of
Austria’s decision to vacate a decision granting a license in Lower Austria and Burgenland for state-licensed
machine gaming. Such appeals or challenges may also relate to time periods during which the operation is
temporarily permitted, based on law and/or order, following a successful appeal.


-----

In addition, the marketing of gaming and betting devices or other gaming and betting products and services in
those countries where the NOVOMATIC AG Group conducts its business requires a permit from a governmental
gaming and betting authority. Both manufacturing and marketing licences are generally granted for limited
periods, subject to review and certification by the competent authorities. Once granted, licences are usually
renewed automatically as long as the requirements governing the given licence have not been violated. It cannot
be precluded that the Issuer or subsidiaries or affiliates of the Issuer fail to comply with statutory requirements,
technical standards, or licensing requirements, which might cause the given licence to be wholly or partly
revoked.

Any occurrence of these events might have an adverse effect on the financial position, cash flow and financial
performance of both the Issuer and the NOVOMATIC AG Group.

**_Risks on account of a potential tightening of regulatory measures._**

Currently, the gaming and betting business, and particularly the laws governing online gaming and betting, are
not harmonised at the level of the European Union (EU). Certain aspects of the EU legal framework remain
disputed among legal gaming and betting experts.

In Germany, for instance, a newly enacted Interstate Treaty on Gambling took effect on 1 July 2012. It provides
for restrictions such as the prohibition of multiple concessions, minimum distance requirements between
gaming/betting premises, restrictions on the hours of business or the expiry within a transitional period of a mere
five years of concessions that were granted in perpetuity under the German Industrial Code (Gewerbeordnung).
The Interstate Treaty on Gambling does not provide rules and regulations that apply on a federal level in
Germany; instead, it allows the individual German states to adopt different rules and regulations.

There is, in general, the risk that additional restrictions will be imposed on the gaming and betting industry at the
national level in those countries where the NOVOMATIC AG Group is active, particularly in Germany.
Furthermore, regulatory authorities may introduce access limitations, strengthen gamer protection measures,
statutory protections for non-smokers, expand technical requirements, prohibitions on advertising, or restrictions
on locations. Such actions might result in a decline in the number of visitors and in sales revenues. The
implementation of one or more of these events might have an adverse effect on the financial position, cash flow
and financial performance of both the Issuer and the NOVOMATIC AG Group.

**_Evolving legal systems, in particular their tax systems, might have a material adverse effect on the Issuer_**
**_and / or the NOVOMATIC AG Group._**

Many legal systems in countries or jurisdictions where the NOVOMATIC AG Group does business have been
subject to far-reaching changes in recent years. In some of these countries, the legal systems are still in an early
stage of development, which leads to the inconsistent application and construction of legal standards. Hence
there is a lack of historical data, case law, or other interpretation tools that could bind and guide those who apply
the law. In particular, the NOVOMATIC AG Group is exposed to a multitude of tax laws, some of which were
enacted just recently, and administrative practices regarding their enforcement that are frequently unpredictable
and generally subject to continuous change. Often enough taxpayers such as the NOVOMATIC AG Group must
turn to the courts to defend their position against the tax authorities. As a result, there is the risk that the
NOVOMATIC AG Group may be subject to unforeseeable and burdensome taxes. In some countries, tax returns
and taxable events are not subject to a limitations period, and the authorities may turn their attention to them
years later. The tax risk thus is substantially higher in several of the countries where the NOVOMATIC AG
Group is active than in other countries whose tax systems have a longer historical development. It may also be
impossible in individual jurisdictions to seek recourse in the courts or obtain other kinds of legal protections
within a reasonable time. Furthermore, given that parliamentary democracies have only developed recently or
not at all in some of the countries where the NOVOMATIC AG Group conducts its business, political or legal
paradigm shifts are less foreseeable than in Austria or Western European member states of the European Union.
A lack of legal certainty and/or the impossibility of being able to avail oneself of efficient legal remedies within
a reasonable time may have an adverse effect on the financial position, cash flow and financial performance of
both the Issuer and the NOVOMATIC AG Group.

**_The NOVOMATIC AG Group is exposed to risks in connection with intellectual property._**

The NOVOMATIC AG Group develops, manufactures, and markets state-of-the-art gaming and betting devices
and systems, most of which are protected by commercial property rights such as trademarks, patents and design
patents as well as copyright law. There is the risk that third parties may interfere with the NOVOMATIC AG
Group’s commercial property rights or copyrights and, conversely, that the NOVOMATIC AG Group will


-----

interfere with third-party commercial property rights or copyrights. There is also the risk that NOVOMATIC AG
Group's may not be able to obtain protection as intended for its intellectual property rights.

Some of the products or services of the NOVOMATIC AG Group might infringe upon the intellectual property
rights of third parties. The NOVOMATIC AG Group is also exposed to the risk that third-party components,
which the Group utilizes in its products, may infringe upon another party’s intellectual property rights. In such
cases, the NOVOMATIC AG Group might have to desist from using the intellectual property rights in question
or pay substantial licence fees to third parties. The NOVOMATIC AG Group is also exposed to the risk that
third parties may acquire patents or other intellectual property in a targeted way with the aim of initiating claims
for damages based thereon.

The gaming and betting industry is characterised by rapid technological developments, which forces the
NOVOMATIC AG Group to continuously develop new products and enter new markets. Hence the
NOVOMATIC AG Group’s success is dependent on its ability to continually develop its products and systems to
integrate new technologies and expand into new markets that may arise as a result of newly developed
technologies. The NOVOMATIC AG Group might not be able to develop and offer certain products and expand
into certain markets if certain technologies are protected by third-party intellectual property rights, including
those of its competitors.

The occurrence of these risks might have an adverse effect on the financial position, cash flow and financial
performance of both the Issuer and the NOVOMATIC AG Group.

**_The NOVOMATIC AG Group is exposed to the risk of failing to sufficiently protect its customer data._**

In part, the NOVOMATIC AG Group possesses confidential information on its customers (name, address, age,
banking information as well as gaming and betting preferences), which it collects in the course of its business
and thus must comply with strict data protection and privacy rules applicable in the EU and other jurisdictions.
There is the risk that customer data may be accessed and/or utilised unlawfully, either by the NOVOMATIC AG
Group’s employees or customers, or by third parties. There is the risk, furthermore, that customer data may be
deleted, disclosed or processed accidentally and in violation of applicable data protection and privacy rules and
regulations. The NOVOMATIC AG Group might be held criminally liable under data protection and privacy
laws, which would also damage its reputation, if the Group or one of its external providers were to transmit
customer data without adequate protections or if confidential customer data were to be lost in any other way.
This or a tightening of regulations in this area might have an adverse effect on the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s
financial position, cash flow and financial performance.

**_Risks on account of the tightening of international money-laundering prevention measures (e.g. Financial_**
**_Action Task Force-EU) and other regulations to prevent the financing of terrorism._**

In the countries where the NOVOMATIC AG Group maintains operations, the running of gaming and betting
establishments, such as live game casinos and electronic slot machine casinos, is governed by numerous and
increasingly strict statutory and regulatory requirements regarding money laundering, the prevention and
combating of terrorist financing, other sanctions stemming from geopolitical developments (such as those put in
place most recently in connection with the events in the Ukraine) or related follow-up measures such as foreign
exchange controls and/or restrictions on the disposal of assets. Internationally, organizations such as the
Financial Action Task Force continually adapt and tighten requirements and standards applicable to money
laundering regulations – not least against the financing of terrorism and in light of the global financial and
economic crisis. For instance, the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force were taken into account
in the Fourth EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive, Directive (EU) 2015/849. Since the directive has not yet
been implemented into national law, the particular ramifications of such implementation are not yet known.
However, any further tightening of the anti-money laundering standards and regulations might cause the
NOVOMATIC AG Group to take additional organizational actions and incur additional costs with respect to the
operation of its business.

It cannot be precluded that such sanctions and/or measures are directed against individual countries and/or
persons with whom the NOVOMATIC AG Group may currently be in a business relationship, particularly if
such sanctions and/or measures are continuously modified and expanded. It further cannot be precluded that the
tightening of such rules and regulations might limit and/or halt third parties’ business relationships with the
NOVOMATIC AG Group due to the nature of the latter’s business activities.

In turn, this might have an adverse effect on the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s financial position, cash flow and
financial performance.


-----

**_Risks on account of tax audits._**

The NOVOMATIC AG Group might be forced by the competent tax authorities in connection with tax audits to
pay back taxes and/or fees. The liquidity of the NOVOMATIC AG Group might be adversely affected if any
such tax liabilities and charges add up to a considerable amount, in turn adversely affecting the NOVOMATIC
AG Group’s net assets, financial position and results of operations.

**4.** **Issuer’s financing risks**

**_The Issuer is exposed to liquidity risk._**

The liquidity risk encompasses the risk of not being able to possess sufficient liquidity at all times or of not
being in a position to draw on required funds (including those that have already been committed) from investors
and financial institutions in order to pay liabilities when due. Given the different maturities of the Issuer’s
liabilities, there is the risk that the Issuer might not be able to satisfy its current or future obligations in full or on
time. Furthermore, the need for cash is very high in the gaming and betting industry, especially in the Group’s
own gaming and betting operations, which requires it to continuously have available a large amount of cash. The
occurrence of the liquidity risk might have an adverse effect on the Issuer’s financial position, cash flows and
financial performance.

**_The Issuer is subject to the risk of unfavourable exchange rates._**

The currency risk comprises fluctuations in the value of financial instruments, other balance sheet items (e.g.
receivables and liabilities), and/or cash flows due to exchange rate fluctuations. In particular, this risk is
prevalent whenever a company’s business transactions are made in a currency other than the local currency. The
NOVOMATIC AG Group operates its business around the world. It generates a considerable portion of its sales
revenues and pays a considerable portion of its operating expenses in currencies other than the Euro—especially
the US Dollar, the British Pound and the local currencies of the Group’s respective subsidiaries. In addition, the
NOVOMATIC AG Group encompasses numerous subsidiaries that are domiciled outside of the European
currency union and prepare their annual financial statements in currencies other than the Euro. Their annual
financial statements are translated into Euros at the time the Group’s audited annual financial report is prepared.
The Issuer also funds a considerable portion of its product purchases in US dollars. Any occurrence of the
currency risk, especially due to the US Dollar or the British Pound foreign exchange rate, could have adverse
effects on the Issuer’s financial position, cash flows and financial performance.

**_The Issuer is exposed to risks of changing interest rates._**

The Issuer has used borrowings for its funding activities. Any changes in interest rates, in particular any increase
in the base interest rate of the European Central Bank or the prime rate of the United States Federal Reserve,
may have an adverse effect on the value of financial instruments, but it may also adversely affect the net interest
income from the financial instruments and thus may also have a negative impact on the Issuer’s financial
position, cash flows and financial performance.

**_Risks on account of assuming liability._**

As part of their business activities, the Issuer and the NOVOMATIC AG Group companies have assumed
liabilities and issued guarantees, sureties, letters of comfort, and purchase price adjustment clauses for
NOVOMATIC AG Group and also for companies that do not belong to the NOVOMATIC AG Group such as in
connection with the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s activities in Romania. Any claims against the NOVOMATIC
AG Group thereunder might have an adverse effect on its financial position, cash flows and financial
performance.

**_The Issuer is exposed to certain market risks in connection with assets and risks associated with investments_**
**_in companies._**

As part of its business activities, the Issuer holds and/or owns assets, securities, precious metals, derivative
financial instruments, and other products that are exposed to market price fluctuations. Any such fluctuations
and/or fair value assessments might cause the Issuer and/or the NOVOMATIC AG Group to incur or be faced
with losses, the non-occurrence of the envisioned hedging effects, and/or additional costs. This might have an
adverse effect on the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s financial position, cash flows and financial performance.


-----

**_The operative and financial flexibility of the NOVOMATIC AG Group could be compromised on account of_**
**_restrictive clauses in certain financing tools._**

Restrictive clauses in certain financial instruments might constrain the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s funding with
respect to its business policies, for example, in connection with asset collateralization and disposals as well as
change of control clauses. This is compounded by financial commitments regarding compliance with certain key
performance indicators (so-called covenants), noncompliance with which may lead creditors to call their loans
before its agreed maturity. Such restraints on disposal, as well as any unforeseen requirement to pay all liabilities
from such financial instruments in lump sums, might have substantially negative effects on the NOVOMATIC
AG Group’s financial position, cash flows and financial performance. Furthermore, the Issuer, directly and
indirectly, holds financial assets, including shares in companies. The ability of such companies to pay out
dividends depends, in part, on its earnings, levels of statutory reserves and capitalization, and various business
considerations. There can be no guarantee that the Issuer will in fact receive dividends on such participations.
Even if dividends are paid out, the amount of such dividend payments may vary significantly over time. A
significant decline in dividends received might have substantially negative effects on the NOVOMATIC AG
Group’s financial position, cash flows and financial performance. Moreover, under mandatory accounting
principles, the Issuer is required to periodically reassess its financial assets. Accordingly, any significant changes
in the valuation of the Group’s financial assets may have a material adverse effect on NOVOMATIC AG
Group’s results of operations and financial condition.

**_Risks in connection with financing agreements._**

Among other things, the NOVOMATIC AG Group uses borrowings based on loan agreements and/or borrower’s
note loans (Schuldscheindarlehen) to finance its business activities. These funding agreements provide for
customary warranties and/or commitments (so-called covenants), which the NOVOMATIC AG Group has
undertaken to comply with. However, noncompliance with any one of these agreements regularly leads to
noncompliance with other contracts (under so-called cross-default provisions). Non-compliance with warranties
and/or commitments under funding contracts thus might have substantially negative effects on the
NOVOMATIC AG Group’s financial position, cash flows and financial performance.

**5.** **Market risks of the NOVOMATIC AG Group**

**_The NOVOMATIC AG Group is exposed to a risk of competition._**

Some of the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s competitors possess extensive financial, technical, and other resources.
There is the risk that the number of competitors or other providers in the leisure and entertainment industry,
especially providers of online gaming and betting, whose number has increased in recent years, will continue to
rise. This might have an adverse effect on the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s financial position, cash flows and
financial performance. The Issuer and the NOVOMATIC AG Group companies are also exposed to the risk of
increased competition in markets where it had previously been protected. Any failure on the part of the
NOVOMATIC AG Group to offer innovative and new competitive products in a timely manner or to obtain
required gaming and betting licenses required to this end might have an adverse effect on the Group’s financial
position, cash flows and financial performance.

**_The NOVOMATIC AG Group is dependent upon certain geographical markets._**

Most of the NOVOMATIC AG Group's sales revenues are generated in Germany, Austria, Italy, and Great
Britain. In the gaming technology segment, the renting of gaming devices in Germany represents a considerable
portion of the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s sales revenues. The NOVOMATIC AG Group’s financial position,
cash flows and financial performance might be adversely affected if the Group fails to maintain its market share
in these markets or if these markets develop negatively — for example, due to increasing regulations and
restrictions, lower market acceptance of gaming device renting, in general, or the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s
current rental requirements, in particular — or if a statutory prohibition or any other restrictions on the rental of
gaming devices were to be implemented.

**6.** **Geographic risks**

**_The international business of the Issuer gives rise to economic, political, legal and other risks._**

The NOVOMATIC AG Group operates in more than 70 countries. Some of these countries are politically and/or
economically unstable, which exposes the NOVOMATIC AG Group to certain risks. The legal framework in
some countries, in which the NOVOMATIC AG Group conducts its business, offers international investors


-----

fewer protections or imposes additional restrictions on them, for example, in connection with foreign exchange
controls or obligations such as compliance with a sanctions regime. In addition, social unrest or strikes in these
countries might force the NOVOMATIC AG Group to interrupt and/or discontinue its business activities. The
gaming and betting industry is particularly exposed to frequent and/or sudden legislative changes that
substantially impede business or may prohibit it entirely. Inadequate legal or administrative parameters in these
countries may also inadequately protect intellectual property, assets, or other rights of the NOVOMATIC AG
Group. In some of these countries, crime and/or corruption are rampant, which might adversely affect the
NOVOMATIC AG Group’s business. The occurrence of such risks might have an adverse effect on the Issuer’s
financial position, cash flows and financial performance.

**7.** **Risks associated with the Notes offered**

**_Every investor bears the risk inherent in making the investment decision._**

Potential investors are advised to base their decision to subscribe to the Notes on their personal situation and
income, their expectations as to the results of their investments, and the long-term commitment of the capital
they contribute. Every investor is advised to obtain professional advice regarding the Notes, the risks associated
with them, and their structure before making an investment decision. There is the risk that investors may make
uninformed investment decisions without taking into account the aforementioned criteria or without availing
themselves of appropriate consultancy services – all of which may cause Noteholders to incur losses.

**_Investors are subject to the credit risk in respect of the Issuer._**

Any person who purchases the Notes is relying on the creditworthiness of the Issuer and has no rights against
any other person. Noteholders are subject to the risk of a partial or total failure of the Issuer to make interest
and/or redemption payments that the Issuer is obliged to make under the Notes. A materialisation of the credit
risk may result in partial or total failure of the Issuer to make interest and/or redemption payments under the
Notes.

In addition, even if the likelihood that the Issuer will be in a position to fully perform all obligations under the
Notes when they fall due has not actually decreased, market participants could nevertheless be of that opinion.
Market participants may in particular be of such opinion, if market participants' assessment of the
creditworthiness of corporate debtors in general or debtors operating in the Issuer’s sector adversely changes. If
any of these risks occur, third parties would only be willing to purchase the Notes for a lower price than before
the materialisation of such risk. The market value of the Notes may therefore decrease.

**_Investors are subject to the interest-rate risk in respect of the Issuer._**

In the case of issued Notes, any change in interest rates leads to changes in the price of the Notes. Rising interest
rates thus lead to falling prices of the Notes. As a rule, the interest rates of the money and capital markets change
daily and thus bring about a daily change in the value of the Notes. Market rates are substantially affected by a
given government’s budgetary policies as well as by central banks’ strategies, especially the European Central
Bank’s strategy, general economic developments, inflation rates, foreign interest rates, and exchange rate
expectations. The longer the residual maturity of a Note, the greater the price change resulting from interest rate
fluctuations. Noteholders that want to sell the Notes prior to maturity are thereby exposed to the risk of price
losses due to the increase in interest rates.

**_Investors in floating rate Notes are subject to the risk of uncertain interest income_**

A Noteholder of a floating rate Note is exposed to the risk of fluctuating interest rate levels and uncertain interest
income. Fluctuating interest rate levels make it impossible to determine the yield of floating rate Notes in
advance. Noteholder of floating rate Notes are thus subject to the risk of uncertain interest income.

**_Suspensions of trading could have negative effects on the liquidity and price of the Notes._**

The FMA (as well as regulatory authorities in other countries of the European Economic Area (EAA), if the
Notes are listed on an unregulated market outside of Austria) are authorised to suspend the trading of the Notes
or to ask the respective stock exchange to suspend trading on various grounds (e.g. qualified breach of duty or
for the purpose of combating market manipulations and insider trading). A stock exchange must suspend trading
in securities of its own volition if the securities no longer fulfil the rules of the regulated market, unless such a
step counteracts the investors’ interests or the interest in maintaining the market’s proper functioning. The FMA
(as well as regulatory authorities in other countries of the European Economic Area) must request that trading be


-----

suspended if the stock exchange does not take the initiative itself in such cases, as long as this is in the interest of
maintaining a functioning market and does not undermine investors’ interests. Any suspension of trading with
respect to the Notes may result in a decrease in their price and might cause Noteholders that sell their Notes prior
to maturity to incur losses.

**_The Issuer's credit rating may change over the term of the Notes (risk of default by the Issuer) or be_**
**_withdrawn entirely._**

The Issuer’s credit rating materially affects the price of the Notes. Any suspension or deterioration in the Issuer’s
credit rating, for instance resulting from increased indebtedness of the Issuer in connection with acquisitions, or
a withdrawal thereof, may lower the price of the issued Notes and, consequently, lead to losses for those
investors that sell the Notes prior to maturity. Moreover, ratings of the Issuer may not adequately reflect all risks
of an investment in the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be
revised or withdrawn by the rating agency at any time. Rating agencies may also change their methodology for
rating securities with features similar to those of the Notes. If such a change is made in the future and, as a result,
the rating of the Notes or the Issuer is lowered, this could have a negative impact on the market price of the
Notes.

**_The Notes are unsecured and are not subject to the system of deposit protection._**

The Notes are unsecured liabilities of the Issuer, and no collateral has been provided to ensure fulfilment of the
given obligations. In addition, the claims against the Issuer under the Notes are not subject to the deposit
insurance systems of credit institutions and not guaranteed by the Republic of Austria. As a result, investors are
exposed to the Issuer’s insolvency risk, and no collateral has been provided for the purpose of satisfying claims
under the Notes.

**_Risks in connection with the leveraged acquisition of Notes._**

Regular payments on the Notes may be lower than the interest rate on a loan taken out for the acquisition of the
Notes. Hence investors should not expect to be able to pay the loan interest using the interest income from the
Notes or the proceeds from the sale of the Notes. When Notes are acquired using debt capital, there is, in the
event of the Issuer’s default or a material drop in the price of the Notes, a risk that the particular Noteholders will
not only be required to bear the resulting loss but must also pay the loan liabilities. This materially increases the
risk of loss.

**_Investors are exposed to the risk that reinvestment may be possible only on less favourable terms._**

In the event of an early sale, redemption at maturity or early termination of the Notes by the Issuer for tax
reasons or by the Noteholders if there is a reason for termination or if the right to tender is exercised in case of a
change of control, there is no assurance that the Noteholders will find a suitable reinvestment option at
conditions that are at least equivalent to those of the respective Notes. The same applies to interest payments
received. In the event of early redemption, there is also the risk that the return on the investment will be lower
than anticipated by the Noteholder.

**_Transaction cost and expenses can diminish the yield of the Notes._**

The purchase, safekeeping, and sale of the Notes may entail commissions, fees, and other transaction costs that
may result in costs that are disproportionately high in the case of smaller aggregate amounts. Such costs may
materially reduce the income potential of the Notes.

**_Risks in connection with the settlement of Note acquisitions through clearing systems._**

A variety of clearing systems are used for settling purchases and sales of the Notes. The Issuer assumes no
responsibility for the Notes actually being transferred to the respective investor’s securities account. There is the
risk that the Notes are not actually transferred to the given investor’s securities account. Hence Noteholders must
rely on the functioning of the clearing systems and banks’ IT-systems.

**_Risks on account of the Notes trading inactively or illiquidly._**

The Notes issued pursuant to this Prospectus may be listed for trading on the Second Regulated Market
(Geregelter Freiverkehr) of the Vienna Stock Exchange or on other, regulated or unregulated markets or not
listed on any stock exchange. If the Notes are listed for trading after they are issued, they may trade below their
offer price depending on prevailing interest rates, the market environment for comparable securities, general


-----

economic conditions and the Issuer’s financial condition. Even though the application for listing in the Second
Regulated Market operated by the Vienna Stock Exchange will be filed, there is no guarantee that the application
will be granted and, even if it was, that an active market will develop. Hence investors must anticipate that the
Notes they hold cannot be sold at all or not at the desired time or the desired price.

**_The Issuer or the Dealers may perform transactions that are not in the interest of the Noteholders, or conflicts_**
**_of interests between the Issuer, the Dealers and the Noteholders may arise on other grounds._**

The interests of the Issuer and the Noteholders may diverge. Additional debt securities issued by the Issuer may
have adverse effects on the Notes’ price. The Issuer may engage in transactions that affect the Notes directly or
indirectly. These transactions may have a negative impact on the price of the Notes. The Issuer is not obliged in
all circumstances to notify Noteholders of such transactions. Noteholders are advised to always keep themselves
informed of market developments.

As part of the normal course of their business as well as in connection with the execution of funding and
securities brokerage transactions, the Dealers and their affiliates may enter into buy and sell positions on behalf
of the Issuer or other NOVOMATIC AG Group companies for their own or third-party account, trade securities,
or carry out other transactions. This may also affect the Notes. As part of its customary funding activities, the
Issuer may also use the proceeds from the issue to wholly or partly repay any outstanding loans from the
Dealers.

Each Arranger is in continuous business contact with the Issuer and may grant loans to it that are subject to
conditions different from those applicable to the Notes. Such conditions might limit the Issuer’s ability to make
payments on the Notes. For example, the loan conditions may oblige the Issuer to comply with specific
covenants, which would not be necessary under the Terms and Conditions governing the Notes. In their capacity
as the Issuer’s creditors, the Arrangers thus may have a conflict of interest with the Noteholders.

**_Noteholders are exposed to a market risk upon selling the Notes._**

The development of the Notes’ price depends on a number of Issuer related factors (e.g. Issuer rating) and
external factors such as fluctuations in market interest rates, central bank policies, tax laws, general economic
developments, developments in the stock markets, inflation rates, or a lack of or excessive demand for such type
of notes. Rumours, market distortions, and price manipulations may adversely affect the Notes as well. While
Noteholders are exposed to the risk that the price of the Notes may take an unfavourable turn, the risk only takes
effect if a Noteholder sells its Notes prior to maturity.

**_Noteholders are exposed to the risk of the Issuer raising further debt capital._**

The Issuer might decide to take on additional debt capital. The Issuer has not entered into any restrictive
covenants in connection with the issuance of the Notes regarding its ability to incur additional indebtedness
ranking pari passu or senior to the obligations under or in connection with the Notes, but has only entered into
restrictive covenants with respect to the granting of security. Incurring such additional indebtedness might hinder
additional payments on the Notes or impair the value of the Notes. Taking on additional liabilities might cause
the Issuer to be unable to fulfil its payment obligations under the Notes.

**_Tax conditions could have an adverse effect on Noteholders._**

Interest payments on Notes and/or profits that a Noteholder realizes when selling or upon redemption of the
Notes may be taxable in the Noteholder’s home country or in other countries. The general tax consequences for
investors are described in the chapters entitled “Taxation in Austria” and “Taxation in Germany”. However, the
actual tax consequences for individual Noteholders may be different from those described for Noteholders in
general. Hence potential Noteholders are advised to turn to their tax consultant regarding the tax consequences of
an investment in the Notes. Moreover, applicable tax rules and regulations may change to the detriment of the
Noteholders in the future. Failure to observe the tax consequences or unfavourable tax laws might have adverse
effects on investments in the Notes.

**_There are risks on account of a potential structural subordination of the Notes to other financing raised by_**
**_the Issuer and its subsidiaries._**

Noteholders are unsecured creditors of the Issuer. In particular, Noteholders are advised not only that the Issuer
might issue financial instruments in the future to which the Notes would be subordinated in structural terms, but
also that the contractual provisions of such financial instruments might impose requirements on the Issuer that


-----

are stricter than the Terms and Conditions governing the Notes. As a result, this may give rise to a scenario
where the Issuer’s creditors might claim termination grounds under such financial instruments in certain
circumstances and might call outstanding amounts, while the Noteholders might not be able to do so, or one
where collateral is provided for third-party creditors of the Issuer and/or its subsidiaries with assets of the Issuer
or its subsidiaries, while the Noteholders are excluded from participating in the proceeds of any disposal thereof.
In such a case, the Noteholders would be exposed to the risk that, following (partial) satisfaction of its creditors’
claims under these other financial instruments, the Issuer would no longer have any funds available to service the
Notes. The Noteholders thus might incur a total loss.

Structural subordination also applies with respect to secured and unsecured creditors of subsidiaries (if and to the
extent that the Issuer itself is not a creditor) because, if the given subsidiary were to file for insolvency, its
creditors, which could include the Issuer, would be entitled to the subsidiary’s assets and the Issuer would only
be able to avail itself of remaining proceeds, if any, after satisfaction of all of the subsidiary’s creditors.
Furthermore, under applicable law the Issuer’s claims against a subsidiary might be treated as subordinated
liabilities in the event of the subsidiary’s insolvency. These facts might have an adverse effect on the Issuer’s
financial position, cash flow and financial performance.

**_A Noteholder of Notes denominated in a currency being a foreign currency to such investor may be exposed_**
**_to adverse changes in currency exchange rates which may affect the yield of such Notes._**

A Noteholder of Notes denominated in a currency being a foreign currency to such investor is exposed to the risk
of changes in currency exchange rates which may affect the yield of such Notes. Changes in currency exchange
rates result from various factors such as macroeconomic factors, speculative transactions and interventions by
central banks and governments. A change in the value of any foreign currency against the Euro, for example,
will result in a corresponding change in the Euro value of Notes denominated in a currency other than Euro. This
will further lead to a corresponding change in the Euro value of interest and principal payments made in a
currency other than in Euro in accordance with the terms of such Notes. If the underlying exchange rate falls and
the value of the Euro correspondingly rises, the price of the Notes and the value of interest and principal
payments made thereunder expressed in Euro falls.

Furthermore, there is a risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the currency in which an investor’s financial
activities are denominated principally may impose or modify exchange controls. Such exchange controls could
adversely affect an applicable exchange rate. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than
expected, or no interest or principal.

**_Noteholders are exposed to the risk of inflation diminishing the real yield._**

The inflation risk refers to the risk that the value of financial assets such as the Notes or the income from them
declines if the purchasing power of a currency diminishes due to inflation. Noteholders are exposed to the risk
that any increase in the inflation rate lowers the actual value of the interest payments on the Notes. In such a
case, the real yield on the Notes may be substantially less than expected.

**_Risks in connection with the appointment of a trustee for the holders of Notes._**

A receiver may be appointed by an Austrian court to safeguard the joint interests of the Noteholders under the
law regarding the joint representation of the rights of the owners of bearer notes or notes that may be transferred
by endorsement and regarding the accounting treatment of mortgagee rights granted with respect to such notes
(Austrian Law Gazette 1874/49). If such a receiver is appointed, it will represent the joint rights and interests of
the Noteholders and is authorised to take legal steps in this regard, which are binding on all Noteholders being
represented and may conflict with the individual interests of some or all those being represented or may interfere
with such interests. It is possible, therefore, that Noteholders may not be able to bring separate claims.

**_The Notes are governed by Austrian law, and changes in the relevant applicable laws, regulations or_**
**_regulatory provisions may have negative effects on the Issuer, on the Notes and on the Noteholders._**

The Terms and Conditions are subject to Austrian law. Hence Noteholders are advised to bear in mind that, in
certain circumstances, the applicable law may not be the law of their home country and that, in certain
circumstances, the laws applicable to the Notes may not offer them protections that are equivalent to, or as
adequate as, their own laws. In addition, no assurance can be given or statement made with respect to the
consequences of any court ruling or amendment of Austrian law (or the laws applicable in Austria) and/or
customary administrative practices after the date of this Prospectus.

**_Rights to claim repayment from the Issuer shall become time-barred unless they are asserted within thirty_**
**_years (in respect of principal) and within three years (in respect of interest)._**

Claims against the Issuer for repayment in connection with the Notes are time-barred and expire unless they are
brought within thirty years (with respect to principal) and within three years (with respect to interest). There is
the risk that, following the expiry of these deadlines, Noteholders will no longer be able to successfully pursue
their claims for repayment in connection with the Notes.

**_Subject to certain conditions being met, the Dealers could withdraw from a contemplated issuance of Notes._**

Any offer to invest in the Notes is subject to the caveat that the Dealers may withdraw from a planned issue of
Notes up until the value date of the Notes in the event of changes in national or international, financial, political,
legal, or tax parameters or in the event of a catastrophe or emergency, such that in the Dealers’ view it is not
possible to issue the Notes under the desired conditions. Potential Noteholders might for these reasons be unable
in the short-term to pursue an investment in the Notes as planned.

**2.** **Business overview**

**_Main areas of operations_**

The Issuer is the parent company of the NOVOMATIC AG Group. As a holding company, the Issuer has no
business operations as such but is responsible for the management of and for support functions for the Group.
The Issuer is thus, to a certain degree, dependent upon dividend payments to be made by its subsidiaries.

The NOVOMATIC AG Group develops, manufactures, sells and rents gaming products and operates
approximately 1,600 gaming and betting facilities and 60,000 gaming machines (as of 30 June 2016, compared
to 1,400 gaming and betting facilities and 47,000 gaming machines as of 31 December 2015). It exports its
products to approximately 80 countries all over the world.


-----

Besides developing gaming, betting and lottery equipment, the NOVOMATIC AG Group has also established
itself as a provider of casino management systems and online monitoring systems, local or central game result
determination including direct interface to state authorities, content provider of games for licensed online and
offline providers as well as an operator of online gaming platforms.

The Group’s dual market strategy as a manufacturer of state-of-the-art gaming equipment, for one, and as an
operator of gaming and betting facilities, for another, has substantially contributed to its success. This integrative
approach enables the NOVOMATIC AG Group to bring newly developed products to the market, analyse their
potential success, and subsequently work on the development of new products in targeted ways.

As part of its strategic positioning, the NOVOMATIC AG Group both continually reviews potential acquisitions
and evaluates companies and/or equity investments of the NOVOMATIC AG Group, especially against the
backdrop of the current economic, legal, and strategic framework. In each case, this is an evaluation process
where the outcome is not predetermined. Aside from maintaining the status quo, it may also result in the
expansion of an existing equity interest as well as in the complete and/or partial sale of equity interests.

**_Business Strategy_**

NOVOMATIC AG has a clear focus on the gaming industry with a high vertical integration along the value
chain within the gaming sector both land-based and online. Further, NOVOMATIC AG has a full horizontal
integration by offering products in all material gaming segments: casino and slot arcade products, lottery and
sports betting solutions, online & mobile games as well as casino management and business intelligence systems.

Through ongoing monitoring of regulatory developments, NOVOMATIC AG aims to capitalize on early-mover
advantages and to develop markets with complex technical and regulatory environments. This tends to
strengthen regional diversification, which increases the resilience to crises and avoids cluster risks.
NOVOMATIC AG focuses its expansion on Europe, with particular focus on key markets such as Austria, UK,
Germany, Italy, Spain or the Netherlands and, in the Gaming Technology segment, also on Australia, North and
South America.

NOVOMATIC AG continues to develop markets with both operations and technology businesses, which
generates synergies on the cost and revenue side. NOVOMATIC AG uses operations to showcase products and
integrates feedback from operations into product development.

NOVOMATIC AG positions itself as a premium provider of high quality gaming equipment and continuously
develops new gaming segments and game content, invests in existing research and development competence
centres and enhances R&D capacities and plurality with selective acquisitions.

NOVOMATIC AG seeks to diversify its creditor and debt investor base with a focus on capital market-based
funding. It also pursues a moderate dividend policy and seeks to maintain a long-term funding basis with
relationship banks, a minimum level of undrawn credit facilities, modest debt ratios and a healthy capital
structure.

**_Functional Segments_**

_Gaming Technology_

The NOVOMATIC AG Group operates ten production facilities in eight countries and, in combination with its
18 technology centres in eleven countries, the NOVOMATIC AG Group is a pioneer in the development of

gaming equipment, gaming content and application software. The developed software system solutions include
management information systems, ticketing and smartcard systems, access systems, video lottery systems,
biometric player recognition, links to government regulators, player protection programs, online and mobile
gaming system solutions, jackpot systems, as well as multiplayer and community gaming systems, among many
others.

243,000 gaming machines (as 30 June 2016, compared to approximately 246,000 as of 31 December 2015).

comprehensive and networked gaming portfolio. In addition, Greentube is also able to provide a comprehensive
range of games of skill that include market-specific content and are also available on mobile platforms.

The NOVOMATIC AG Group is continuously expanding its competence in regard to lottery services. Through

lottery operator a full-spectrum solution for all sales channels, including online, mobile and terrestrial solutions.

Gaming Technology segment is on the area of gaming machine rental. In Germany, the NOVOMATIC AG
Group has a market share of more than 50 percent as regards the rental of gaming machines outside of casinos.
However, due to a stricter regulatory framework, the number of rented gaming devices has decreased during the
course of 2015 and the first half of 2016.

Furthermore, the NOVOMATIC AG Group, with its subsidiaries Extra Games Entertainment GmbH, Admiral
Play GmbH and BPA Freizeit- und Unterhaltungsbetriebe GmbH operates approximately 390 gaming operations
as of 30 June 2016 in Germany. In addition, the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s Gaming Operations segment
operates seven casinos in Germany, including Spielbank Berlin, one of the largest casinos in Germany.

_Italy_

With more than 400,000 gaming devices in operation as of the end of 2015, Italy is Europe’s largest gaming
market. The NOVOMATIC AG Group established its first Italian subsidiary, NOVOMATIC Italia S. p. A., in
2007. Over the years, Italy has become one of the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s most important core markets.

In Italy, the NOVOMATIC AG Group provides as market leader one of the most widely used Video Lottery
Systems (NOVOLINE), with a market share of approximately 24,000 Video Lottery Terminals as of the end of
2015.

In addition, the NOVOMATIC AG Group operates approximately 140 gaming venues in Italy as of 30 June
2016 under the registered ADMIRAL brand and also offers online gaming and online betting.

_Great Britain_

The British gaming market is one of the largest and most developed markets in Europe. The British market
includes approximately 250,000 gaming devices, which are mostly located in pubs, licensed betting offices,
gaming facilities and bingo centres. Due to the highly mature nature of the market, the potential for a further
increase in the number of gaming devices operated is limited. The market is rather moving towards a state of
consolidation. The NOVOMATIC AG Group first entered the British gaming market in 2004 with the
acquisition of Astra Games Ltd. (now Novomatic UK Ltd.). In Great Britain, the NOVOMATIC AG Group
employs a total workforce of more than 2,000 people, rents out more than 20,500 gaming machines and operates
approximately 18,500 (excluding amusement machines, e.g. in family entertainment centers) and also operates,
among others, the following companies:

   - Manufacturing group companies Astra Games Ltd., Bell-Fruit Group Ltd. and Empire Games Ltd..

   - Gamestec Leisure Ltd., which is one of the largest gaming and amusement machine operators in the UK
and provides services for over 12,700 gaming machines as of 30 June 2016.

   - Luxury Leisure Ultd., which operates 83 adult gaming centres.

   - Playnation Ltd., which was acquired by the NOVOMATIC AG Group in 2015 and is a provider of
family entertainment solutions to the British leisure industry and operates approximately 4,000 gaming
machines as of 30 June 2016.

   - Talarius Ltd, which was acquired by the NOVOMATIC AG Group in June 2016 and which is an
operator of more than 7,500 gaming terminals in appr. 160 gaming operations and employs about 1,000
staff. With the acquisition of Talarius Ltd., Novomatic UK Ltd. is one of the largest gaming operator in
the segment “Adult Gaming Centers” in the UK. The acquisition remains subject to merger control
clearance by the competent competition authority in the United Kingdom.

For the NOVOMATIC AG Group, Great Britain represents an important future market that offers significant
opportunities.

_The Netherlands_

In 2013, the NOVOMATIC AG Group entered the Dutch gaming market with several acquisitions of wellestablished Dutch gaming companies (e.g. JVH exploitative products B.V., JVH gaming products B.V.). In


-----

recent years NOVOMATIC AG Group has emerged to one of the most important operators of gaming devices in
the Dutch single site market (i.e. the operation of gaming devices at third-party locations).

In The Netherlands, the NOVOMATIC AG Group is active in both the Gaming Technology (sale of machines)
and Gaming Operations segment through its Novo Gaming Netherlands subgroup with several affiliated
companies. As of 30 June 2016, NOVOMATIC AG Group operated approximately 4,000 gaming machines in
the Dutch market.

_Spain_

The Spanish gaming market is one of Europe’s largest gaming markets and thus represents an important target
market for the NOVOMATIC AG Group. A strategically important acquisition was completed in December
2014 with the purchase of GIGAMES S.L. as well as three further subsidiaries. GIGAMES S.L. is Spain’s thirdlargest production and sales company for gaming machines.

In 2015, the NOVOMATIC AG Group won a bid to supply the Loteria de Catalunya with 2,300 Online-Lottery
Terminals and was awarded with a license for the operation of a casino in San Roque (Andalusia) .

In December 2015, 100 percent of the shares of Admiral Operations Spain S.L. (previously Overlord Gaming
S.L.), were acquired by NOVOMATIC AG Group. The acquired company is the parent company of five further
subsidiaries in which it holds a majority interest. The business activities of this Spanish group of companies
focus on the operation of 46 gaming facilities with approximately 900 gaming machines in Madrid as of 30 June
2016.

In July 2016, NOVOMATIC AG Group opened the new Casino Admiral in San Roque. Within an area of
approximately 4,650 m[2], the casino offers 125 state-of-the-art gaming-terminals and 8 gaming tables. Also in
July 2016, NOVOMATIC AG Group acquired the Gran Casino Aljarafe, SA, a gaming facility in Seville.

_CEE/SEE_

The activities of the NOVOMATIC AG Group in Central Eastern Europe (CEE) and South Eastern Europe
(SEE) are mainly in the Gaming Operations segment.

The NOVOMATIC AG Group runs approximately 600 gaming operations in CEE/SEE as of 30 June 2016, with
a particular focus on the markets in Latvia, with 125 gaming operations, Romania, with 76 gaming operations,
and Croatia, with 78 gaming operations.

In 2015, the companies belonging to the Gaming Operations segment within the regions of CEE and SEE were
able to increase both the total number of locations as well as the number of gaming machines operated. In 2013,
the Group acquired Casino FlaminGo, located in Macedonia. As of the end of 2015, this casino complex
includes approximately 470 gaming machines and 30 gaming tables, as well as an integrated five-star hotel.

The Group’s Romanian companies, which are part of the Gaming Operations segment, were able to increase the
number of facilities operated. Moreover, a 15-year partnership was entered into with Loteria Romana by the end
of 2013. Under this contract the NOVOMATIC AG Group had already installed approximately 5,000 Video
Lottery Terminals (VLTs) in Romania as of 30 June 2016.

In Latvia, the most important market within the CEE region, the two subsidiaries Admiralu Klubs SIA and Alfor
SIA with a total of 125 gaming facilities and approximately 3,600 gaming machines as of 30 June 2016
succeeded in defending their strong market position.

**Total ................................................................................................** **1,094.9** **988.2** **2,086.3** **1,977.6**

The largest absolute increase was achieved in the area of rental and management services revenues, which rose
by 7.9% to EUR 594.7 million. Apart from the successful acquisition of Playnation in the United Kingdom
completed in 2015, the established companies in Italy and Germany also contributed to this positive
development.

In the 2015 financial year, revenue growth came in slightly lower in the areas of betting revenues (up EUR 19.3
million) revenues from the operation of slot machines (up EUR 18.7 million) and sales revenues (up EUR 13.1
million). Compared to the previous financial year, revenues from the operation of slot machines, underperformed
due to the discontinuation of state-regulated gaming in Vienna. E-business revenues also increased by only EUR
10.4 million, showing signs of a weakening momentum compared to previous years.


-----

In the first half of 2016, the NOVOMATIC Group’s sales revenue was EUR 1,094.9 million, compared to
EUR 988.2 million in the same period during 2015. The largest increase in sales, in absolute figures, was
achieved in the area of gaming machine revenue, which increased by 11.8%. Major contributions to this
development were made primarily by acquiring numerous gaming hall operators in Germany, Italy and Spain.
Significant revenue increases were also achieved regarding betting, sales and rental revenues.

_Earnings_

Compared to the previous period, in the 2015 financial year, the operating result plus depreciation, amortization,
and impairment on intangible assets, property, plant, and equipment, as well as investment property of the
NOVOMATIC AG Group (EBITDA) decreased by about 4.7%* to EUR 616.7 million*. The EBITDA margin
was 29.6%* (32.7%* the previous year).

Total comprehensive income................................................................ 43.1 131.7 227.9 267.8

(1) For the definition of EBITDA, please see XII. Glossary below.

At EUR 325.4 million, the operating profit for the 2015 financial year decreased from EUR 363.3 million the
previous financial year. The most important reason for the decline of 10.4% is the discontinuation of stateregulated gaming in Vienna.

Earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciations and amortizations (EBITDA) for the first half of 2016 came in
at EUR 287.2* million, which is EUR 3.6* million below the result achieved in the first half of 2015. The
operating profit (EBIT) declined by EUR 20.4 million, due to higher planned and unplanned depreciations and
amortizations relating to acquisitions and the repeal of the concession for the location in Vienna, and amounted
to EUR 141.4 million.

EBITDA and EBIT represent business indicators that are not defined in the International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS). They serve the management of the NOVOMATIC AG Group as measurement and control
levers for the economic success and the profitability of the Group. The EBIT figure corresponds to the operating
profit as represented in the consolidated income statement for the NOVOMATIC AG Group. The EBITDA
figure is calculated as the operating profit (EBIT) adjusted with scheduled and unscheduled depreciation and
revaluation on intangible assets and tangible assets.

_Cash flows_

Compared to the previous period, the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s cash flows from operating activities decreased
in the 2015 financial year to EUR 417.4 million from EUR 444.5 million in the 2014 financial year. This
decrease was largely due to lower operating profit, higher tax payments and an increase in receivables.

Change in cash and cash equivalents...............................................................40.0 -172.7 -124.7 209.6


-----

In the 2015 financial year, cash flow from investment activities amounted to EUR -439.9 million, while the
comparative figure for the 2014 financial year amounted to EUR -195.7 million. Apart from an increase in cash
outflows for investments in gaming devices produced in-house against the previous year, this significant change
was in particular due to the transactions for the purchase of an indirect interest of approximately 23.1% in
Austrian Lotteries.

In the 2015 financial year, cash flow from financing activities amounted to EUR -105.2 million, a decline against
the previous financial year’s value of EUR -47.8 million. While in the previous financial year the issuance of a
new bond (volume of EUR 200 million) resulted in a positive cash inflow, the cash flow from financing
activities decreased in 2015 due to the repayment of a bond which had reached maturity (volume of EUR 200
million). The interest and dividend payments increased against the previous financial year, resulting in a further
negative impact on cash flow from financing activities. The issue of a promissory note bond and an increase in
bank liabilities were not enough to compensate for the above-mentioned effects during the 2015 financial year.

At EUR -22.5* million, the free cash flow (the sum of the cash flow from operating activities and the cash flow
from investment activities) for the 2015 financial year was considerably lower than the EUR 248.8* million
achieved the previous year.

Across the Group, in the first half of 2016, cash flow from operating activities decreased slightly to EUR 194.2
million compared to EUR 199.1 million in 2015. In comparison to the previous year, higher depreciation and
less cash flow for income tax were able to compensate only partially for lesser operating profit during the current
reporting period.

In the first half of 2016, the cash flow from investment activities increased from EUR -166.7 million in the
corresponding period of the previous year to EUR -301.5 million during the reporting period. The position
"acquisition of consolidated companies, net of cash" deviated significantly from the previous year, due to the
acquisition of Talarius. There were also increases in the areas of investments in intangible assets and tangible
assets.

In the first half of 2016, the cash flow from financing activity underwent a notable positive development in
comparison to the previous year period (EUR -207.1 million) and amounted to EUR 157.6 million. Besides a
negative cash flow effect in the first half of 2015 from the redemption of a bond and the capital increase
performed by Gryphon Invest AG in April 2016, lower dividend payments led to the increase in the current
reporting period.

In the first half of 2016, the free cash flow decreased from EUR 32.4* million in the corresponding period of the
previous year to EUR -107.3* million. The Free Cash Flow (FCF) represents a business indicator that is not
defined in the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The FCF is calculated as sum of the cash flow
from operating activities and investing activities (which are both illustrated in the Group cash flow statement).
Free cash flow serves as an indicator for the Group’s internal financing capability, measuring the Group’s ability
of using continuous inflow to pay out dividends, reduce debts and finance further investments.

_Non-current and current liabilities_

The non-current liabilities as of 31 December 2015 were EUR 1,209.2 million (31 December 2014: EUR 788.9
million) and the current liabilities were EUR 563.1 million (31 December 2014: EUR 671.2 million).

The maturity profile of material liabilities as of the date of this Prospectus in EUR million is broken down as

**4.** **Regulatory Environment**

The NOVOMATIC AG Group operates on the basis of the currently applicable political, economic, legal, and
tax framework that is subject to constant change, adjustment and application as well as interpretation by
competent courts and agencies. In general, gaming rules and regulations are regarded as a subject matter of
public interest, often times subject to state monopolies and/or licensing requirements and, hence, a highly
regulated environment. Moreover, unlike in many other industries, the gaming and betting industries are not
regulated on an EU level. Consequently, the NOVOMATIC AG Group is subject to ample layers of legal
requirements at a federal and local level in the jurisdictions in which it operates.

A change of regulatory environment, for instance, occurred 2009 when gaming and betting was outlawed in both
the Russian Federation (with the exception of specially designated zones) and the Ukraine (entire country). In
Hungary, a law prohibiting the operation of gaming devices in arcades and pubs was enacted and implemented in
2012. In Germany, a newly enacted Interstate Treaty on Gambling (Deutscher Glücksspielstaatsvertrag) took
effect on 1 July 2012. It provides for restrictions such as the prohibition of multiple concessions, minimum
distance requirements between gaming/betting premises, restrictions on the hours of business or the expiry
within a transitional period of a mere five years of concessions that were granted in perpetuity under the German
Industrial Code (Gewerbeordnung). Furthermore, amendments to the gaming law in Albania will result in a
discontinuation of the operation of electronic casinos by the end of 2016.

All gaming operators active in Italy, among them the NOVOMATIC AG Group, are affected by the repeated and
significant increases in gaming-related taxes during the past years. As of January 2015, the taxes on amusement
with prize gaming devices were once again increased. In addition to this, the “Legge di Stabilità” was passed at
the end of December 2014. This budget law provides for the levying of an additional amount of EUR 500
million. The total amount was split between all networked gaming devices, resulting in an annual amount of
approximately EUR 1,200 per device. Apart from the national laws, the gaming market is also negatively
impacted by local regulations which – depending on the region – may prescribe shorter hours of operation or a
minimum distance to public institutions.

Furthermore, in Vienna, Austria, as a precautionary measure, all gaming machines operated by subsidiaries of
the NOVOMATIC AG Group under valid licences were decommissioned on 31 December 2014 due to an
ambiguity in the state laws on gaming in Vienna. The relevant Group companies were forced to implement this
step, as local authorities, contrary to the opinion of leading experts on constitutional law, threatened to strictly
enforce certain new legal provisions regarding the operation of the relevant gaming machines. The
NOVOMATIC AG Group's companies with concessions in Vienna submitted an individual request to the
Austrian Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof) in order to review the constitutionality of the new legal
provisions regarding state-regulated gaming in Vienna. With its decision dated 12 March 2015, the Austrian
Constitutional Court rejected this request and confirmed that the provisions of the Gaming Act are not
unconstitutional. Thus since 1 January 2015 the NOVOMATIC AG Group does not operate gaming machines in
Vienna.

As of the end of June 2016, the NOVOMATIC AG Group operated 151 gaming halls and 2,370 gaming
machines in the Austrian federal states Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Styria, Carinthia and Burgenland.

ADMIRAL Casinos & Entertainment AG, a wholly owned subsidiary of NOVOMATIC AG, was able to obtain
the relevant licenses for state-licensed machine gaming (Landesausspielungen) in the federal states of Lower
Austria, Upper Austria, Burgenland, Styria and Carinthia. The licenses for Carinthia and Styria are not subject to
any legal challenges, while the license for Upper Austria is legally effective although it still remains subject to
extraordinary appeals pending before the Highest Administrative Court of Austria (Verwaltungsgerichtshof).

In the federal states of Lower Austria, Styria, Upper Austria and Burgenland, the roll-out of the gaming
machines took place on schedule, while in Carinthia, the final roll out is going to be carried out in autumn 2016.

In May 2016 and in June 2016, the Highest Administrative Court of Austria rendered a decision on the
extraordinary appeal relating to the granting of the license in Lower Austria and Burgenland pursuant to which
the decision to grant the license was vacated due to formal errors of the relevant authorities and the case
remanded for new licensing decisions. However, according to a provision in the relevant state law of Lower
Austria, continued operation is permitted for the next 18 months and with regards to Burgenland for 12 months
based on state law of Burgenland and a specific order issued by the relevant authority.

Currently, proceedings are pending before the Supreme Court of Austria (Oberster Gerichtshof) reviewing the
conformity of the Austrian Gaming Act with the European principle of free movement of services in the context
of unfair competition. In this respect, the Supreme Court of Austria argues that (i) the Gaming Act allegedly
infringes the European principle of free movement of services and (ii) several provisions of the Gaming Act are
allegedly discriminating and unconstitutional. Hence, the Supreme Court of Austria suspended the proceedings
in March 2016 and requested the Austrian Constitutional Court to confirm the constitutionality. The proceedings
are pending before the Austrian Constitutional Court. In unrelated proceedings the Highest Administrative Court
of Austria held in March 2016 that the Austrian Gaming Act complies with European Law.

With respect to the operation of casinos, in June 2014, the Austrian Federal Ministry of Finance granted its
approval for the three remaining individual licenses for the operation of casinos according to § 21 of the Austrian
Gaming Act. As part of this, ADMIRAL Casinos & Entertainment AG ("ACE"), a wholly owned subsidiary of
NOVOMATIC AG, was awarded concessions for the locations Vienna North-East (Prater) and Lower Austria
(Bruck an der Leitha). The concession decisions were successfully challenged by a competitor (CASINOS
Austria AG, which holds the other 12 casino licenses in Austria): The Highest Administrative Court of Austria
rendered the decision in respect of this challenge, confirming that the sub-criteria used by the Austrian Federal
Ministry of Finance, should have been published from the beginning of the tender procedure. Consequently, the
gaming licenses issued by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Finance were repealed. NOVOMATIC AG is not
aware whether the Austrian Federal Ministry of Finance will proceed with a new tender process.

For a description of the legal risks associated with NOVOMATIC AG Group‘s business, please see Section II.3
(Legal risks) above.

**5.** **Material Contracts**

The NOVOMATIC AG Group has entered into various agreements material for its business operations.

**_Joint Venture in relation to Compania Nationala Loteria Romana_**

In October 2013, the NOVOMATIC AG Group concluded an agreement with Compania Nationala Loteria
Romana (CNLR), Romania’s state-owned lottery company, regarding the country-wide delivery and installation
of up to 10,000 video lottery terminals (VLTs) and the video lottery system required to this end. By the end of
2013, NOVOMATIC AG Group had already installed approximately 5,000 VLTs.

The agreement has a term of 15 years and provides for a 50:50 division of the income generated. NOVOMATIC
AG Group committed to issuing a limited guarantee for up to EUR 75m as part of the agreement and in favour of
Compania Nationala Loteria Romana, which serves to secure the income of Compania Nationala Loteria
Romana and will begin to run for 12 months once all video lottery terminals have been delivered in accordance
with the agreement.

**_Transactions and proceedings relating to Casinos Austria_**

NOVOMATIC AG Group has entered into a series of transactions relating to Casinos Austria and Austrian
Lotteries, which transactions have been subject to proceedings before the competition authorities, as hereafter
described in greater detail. In addition, NOVOMATIC AG Group has entered into a term sheet agreement with
SAZKA Group A.S. and Austrian Gaming Holding A.S., both of which are Czech companies (the "SAZKA
**Group"), aimed at establishing a target structure relating to Casinos Austria.**

_Casinos Austria Transactions_

In July 2015, the NOVOMATIC AG signed agreements to acquire separate stakes in Casinos Austria held by
each of MTB Privatstiftung, Leipnik-Lundenburger Invest and the UNIQA Insurance Group, where the stakes


-----

held by MTB Privatstiftung are direct stakes in Casinos Austria while the stakes held by each of LeipnikLundenburger Invest and the UNIQA Insurance Group are stakes in Medial Beteiligungs-Gesellschaft m.b.H., a
direct shareholder of Casinos Austria. There are direct and indirect shareholders of Raiffeisen Bank International
AG, an Arranger and Dealer under the Programme, including Raiffeisen Zentralbank Österreich, which are also
indirect shareholders of Leipnik-Lundenburger Invest as well as of UNIQA Insurance Group. Assuming
successful closing of such transactions, the NOVOMATIC AG’s aggregate holdings of capital in Casinos
Austria would amount to 39.5%, giving it the largest stake in Casinos Austria, even larger than the 33.24% stake
held indirectly by the Republic of Austria through Österreichische Bundes- und Industriebeteiligungen GmbH
(ÖBIB). The above mentioned transactions are subject to long-stop dates ranging from the end of September
2016 to the end of September 2017.

Furthermore, the NOVOMATIC AG entered into agreements for call options and share voting agreements, and
finalized agreements for put options, regarding direct and indirect stakes in Casinos Austria of, in aggregate, less
than 20%, in parts subject to various regulatory approvals, both domestic and international, including merger
control clearances and subject to rights of first refusal by shareholders and approval by the shareholders’ meeting
and partially long stop dates (the aforementioned transactions and negotiations together hereinafter referred to as
the "Casinos Austria Transactions").

In addition to the Casinos Austria Transactions, the NOVOMATIC AG Group may enter into additional
discussions and agreements aimed at obtaining further, or disposing of, interests in Casinos Austria or,
depending on the circumstances, re-evaluate its interests and restructure the Casinos Austria Transactions,
including in connection with the term sheet agreement on the establishment of a target structure relating to
Casinos Austria (see below, "Term sheet agreement on the establishment of a target structure relating to
_Casinos Austria")._

Importantly, however, while approval by the shareholders’ meeting has been partially granted, the Casinos
Austria Transactions remain subject to various regulatory approvals, both domestic and international, including
merger control clearance. Moreover, the Casinos Austria Transactions are subject to rights of first refusal by
shareholders. Any sale of stakes by a shareholder can be challenged by other shareholders if such sale does not
conform to the requirements under such rights of first refusal. Accordingly, the NOVOMATIC AG Group may
not be in a position to acquire all stakes it contemplates acquiring as a result of such challenges.

_Proceedings before the competition authorities_

On 23 December 2015, the NOVOMATIC AG filed for approval of the Casinos Austria Transactions as well as
its acquisitions relating to Austrian Lotteries described below with the Austrian Federal Competition Authority.
The Austrian Federal Competition Authority and the Austrian Federal Cartel Prosecutor (the "Statutory
**Parties") then had a period of six weeks from submission of the merger filing to apply for an in-depth review of**
the matter. On 3 February 2016, on the final day of such six week period, the Statutory Parties requested an indepth review of the matter by the Austrian Cartel Court ("Phase II request") due to competition concerns
regarding the Casinos Austria Transactions and also questioned whether the proposed transaction was advanced
enough to be filed as a concentration.

On 26 August 2016, following the review pursuant to the Phase II request, the Cartel Court issued a prohibition
decision, which decision was received by NOVOMATIC AG on 30 August 2016. In its decision, the Cartel
Court did not approve an acquisition of more than 25% of direct and indirect stakes in Casinos Austria and
Austrian Lotteries, thereby preventing the completion of the Casinos Austria Transactions (the "Cartel Court
**Decision"). The Cartel Court, based on an assessment of the court-appointed expert, held that the combined**
entity would have a dominant position on certain markets in which the NOVOMATIC AG Group operates. The
competition authorities and NOVOMATIC AG were engaged in remedy discussions during the Cartel Court’s
review. The remedies offered by NOVOMATIC AG were rejected by the Cartel Court and the remedy
discussions failed on account of the assessment by NOVOMATIC AG that the conditions demanded by the
Austrian Federal Competition Authority were, in the view of NOVOMATIC AG, economically untenable and
would therefore not be implemented. The Cartel Court Decision is subject to appeal, which appeal may be filed
within four weeks upon receipt of the Cartel Court Decision. NOVOMATIC AG intends to appeal the Cartel
Court Decision.

_Austrian Lotteries_

Through a series of transactions, the Issuer acquired an indirect aggregate holding of approximately 23% in
Austrian Lotteries. Austrian Lotteries is an indirect subsidiary of Casinos Austria. The Issuer entered into several


-----

transactions to acquire the above-referenced holding in Austrian Lotteries, signing separate share purchase
agreements with various sellers with each agreement including customary representations and warranties. The
Issuer now holds directly the holding companies RSV Beteiligungs GmbH, LTB Beteiligungs GmbH and a twothirds stake in CLS Beteiligungs GmbH, which each hold stakes in Lotto-Toto Holding GmbH, which itself
holds a 32% stake in Austrian Lotteries, with the remaining 68% stake therein being held, directly and indirectly,
by Casinos Austria.

Furthermore, NOVOMATIC AG has entered into certain put option and/or share voting agreements with other
indirect shareholders of Austrian Lotteries pursuant to which NOVOMATIC AG will control the voting rights of
the shares in CLS Beteiligungs GmbH held by such shareholders subject to merger control approval. In addition,
and in consideration of the Cartel Court Decision, NOVOMATIC AG may enter into additional discussions
aimed at obtaining and/or divesting interests in Austrian Lotteries.

_Term sheet agreement on the establishment of the target structure relating to Casinos Austria_

Moreover, NOVOMATIC AG entered into a term sheet agreement with the SAZKA Group, on the terms to be
agreed upon in a joint venture agreement relating to the holding of their respective direct and indirect stakes in
Casinos Austria and Austrian Lotteries. The joint venture shall serve as the holding entity of the joint venture
partners’ current and future interests in Casinos Austria and Austrian Lotteries. Both NOVOMATIC AG and
SAZKA Group shall be equal partners, each holding a 50% stake in the envisaged joint venture. Furthermore,
NOVOMATIC AG and the SAZKA Group intend to increase the joint venture’s stake in Casinos Austria by
completing further transactions and have, to that end, signed a memorandum of understanding with another
shareholder of Casinos Austria, which memorandum of understanding also addresses governance issues relating
to Casinos Austria.

The establishment of the joint venture is subject to various conditions precedents which include, among others,
the completion of the Casinos Austria Transactions, which completion would, in particular, require a successful
appeal of the Cartel Court Decision (assuming such appeal would lead directly or indirectly to a clearance of the
merger without remedies or under such remedies as acceptable to NOVOMATIC AG), the signing of a joint
venture agreement, approval by the competition authorities and various domestic and international regulatory
bodies, non-exercise of rights of first refusal by shareholders, approval by required shareholders’ meetings as
well as the non-expiry of the long stop date on 31 December 2018.

**_Ainsworth Game Technology Limited_**

On 23 February 2016, NOVOMATIC AG entered into an agreement to purchase approximately 53% of the
issued shares of Ainsworth GT Limited from Leonard H. Ainsworth for approximately 473 million Australian
dollars. Ainsworth GT Limited is an Australian publicly listed company trading on the Australian Securities
Exchange and a leading producer and provider of gaming solutions with operations in Australasia, South East
Asia and North and South America.

The acquisition agreement is subject to various conditions precedent. These include receipt of the necessary
approvals of international gaming authorities, receipt of any required merger control clearance, receipt of foreign
investment approval by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia and the granting of all material and
required change of control waivers by contractual counterparties, in particular in connection with an existing
financing agreement, as well as the approval of the minority shareholders, which approval was granted on
27 June 2016. Apart from approvals of numerous international gaming authorities, all other conditions precedent
have been fulfilled. However, since such approvals by gaming authorities are required, the closing date of this
transaction remains uncertain. The long-stop date for completion of the transaction is 31 December 2017.

**6.** **Litigation and Arbitration**

NOVOMATIC AG and/or the NOVOMATIC AG Group are involved in various litigation proceedings and
claims incidental to the normal conduct of their business. Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of any
ongoing litigation proceedings, the Issuer believes that such litigation proceedings and claims will not have a
material adverse effect on its business or consolidated financial results. The Issuer notes, however, that the
outcome of litigation proceedings can be extremely difficult to predict with certainty and the Issuer therefore
offers no assurances in this regard.

There are no, nor have there been any governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings involving the Issuer or any
of its subsidiaries (including any such proceedings which are pending or threatened of which the Issuer is aware)


-----

which may have, or have had during the twelve months prior to the date of this document, individually or in the
aggregate, a significant effect on the financial position or profitability of the Issuer and/or the NOVOMATIC
AG Group.

**7.** **Recent Developments**

The following provides an overview of the most significant recent developments affecting the NOVOMATIC
AG Group:

- In May 2016 and June 2016, the Highest Administrative Court of Austria rendered a decision on the
extraordinary appeal relating to the granting of the license in Lower Austria and Burgenland pursuant to
which the decision to grant the license was vacated and the case remanded for new licensing proceedings
(please see Section IV.4 (Regulatory Environment) above).

- For a description of the recent investments, see IV.3 (Selected financial information and discussion –
_Investments) above._

- In relation to the Casinos Austria Transactions, the Austrian Cartel Court issued a prohibiting decision on
account of the assessment by NOVOMATIC AG Group that the remedies required by the competition
authority respectively the Cartel Court were economically untenable and would therefore not be accepted.
NOVOMATIC AG Group intends to appeal the Cartel Court’s decision (please see Section IV.5 (Material
_Contracts) above)._

**8.** **Organizational structure**

As the Group parent of the NOVOMATIC AG Group, the Issuer holds many direct and indirect equity interests
in companies both in Austria and abroad. In its capacity as a holding company, the Issuer does not engage in any
actual operating business; instead, it is responsible for managing the Group and for supporting functions. Due to
its operational structure, the Issuer relies to a certain extent on its subsidiaries’ dividend payments.

Among others, its main functions include group strategy and group development, group treasury (e.g. group
funding and investor relations); group compliance, real estate, group licensing (gaming licenses) and IP rights
(trademarks, patents, copyrights, designs, utility models and know-how/trade secrets and management and
licensing thereof).

As of 30 June 2016, the NOVOMATIC AG Group comprises of 198 fully consolidated companies (compared to
188 fully consolidated companies as of 31 December 2015).

The NOVOMATIC AG Group, the Issuer, and the position of the Issuer within the NOVOMATIC AG Group
are shown in the following summary organisational chart, which shows the significant companies of the
NOVOMATIC AG Group, along with the three parent companies of the NOVOMATIC Group.

The following organisational chart shows subsidiaries of NOVOMATIC AG which contributed revenues in
excess of 2% to the NOVOMATIC Group’s consolidated revenue as reported on 30 June 2016 and which remain
subsidiaries of the Issuer as of the date of this Prospectus.

**_Conflicts of interest_**

There are no conflicts of interest between the private interests or other obligations of the members of the
management board and supervisory board and their obligations towards the Issuer.

**10.** **Corporate governance**

An audit committee has been established for the Issuer in accordance with section 92 (4a) Austrian Stock
Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, AktG). The members of the committee are Kommerzialrat Herbert Lugmayr and
Mag. Martina Flitsch and Mag. Martina Kurz. Among other things, the audit committee is responsible for
reviews and preparations ahead of the adoption of the Consolidated Financial Statements pursuant to section
92 (4a) AktG.

The Issuer’s shares are not listed for trading in a regulated market, and the Issuer thus is not obliged to comply
with the provisions of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code.

**11.** **Major shareholders**

The Issuer is part of the NOVOMATIC Group. The NOVOMATIC Group is the joint designation for the three
separate groups whose parent companies are NOVO Invest GmbH (which holds 89.96% of the Issuer), ACE
Casino Holding AG, and Gryphon Invest AG (which holds 10.04% of the Issuer); in each of such three parent
companies, Professor Johann F. Graf is the direct sole shareholder. In April 2016, the General Assembly agreed
the payment of a dividend totalling EUR 50.0 million (EUR 152.0 million in the previous financial year) to the
shareholders. The payment of the agreed dividend was made in May 2016.

Given the concentration of shareholdings and the shareholder representatives on the supervisory board, the
owner of the majority shareholder is in a position, taking into account provisions of the law and of the articles of
association, to determine the basic principles of the Issuer’s business policies and to control key corporate
decisions.

In the Issuer’s view, the NOVOMATIC AG Group’s internal corporate governance structure together with the
provisions of Austrian corporate law offer adequate protections against any abuse by NOVO Invest GmbH and
Professor Johann F. Graf of their controlling stake.

**_Agreements regarding the control of the Issuer_**

The Issuer is unaware of any agreements that might lead to a change of control with respect to the Issuer at a
later date if executed.


-----

**V.** **GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAMME**

**1.** **General**

Under the Programme, the Issuer may issue Notes from time to time through one or more of the following
Dealers: Erste Group Bank AG, Raiffeisen Bank International AG and UniCredit Bank Austria AG and
additional Dealers appointed by the Issuer under this Programme, where the appointment may be either for a
particular issuance or permanent, in any currency agreed between the Issuer and the Dealer(s). The maximum
principal amount of Notes outstanding under the Programme shall at no time exceed EUR 2,000,000,000 (or
nearly equivalent in another currency). The Issuer can at any time increase the volume of the Programme in
accordance with the conditions of the Programme Agreement. An increase of the volume of the Programme by
more than 15% constitutes a material circumstance and therefore requires the publication of a supplement to the
present Prospectus pursuant to § 6 KMG, which shall be prepared, published and filed, and approved by the
FMA, all in the same manner as this Prospectus.

Notes can be issued on an ongoing basis through one or more Dealers. Notes can be issued by way of public or
non-public offer and in each case on a non-syndicated or a syndicated basis. The method of distribution of each
Tranche will be stated in the relevant Final Terms.

Notes are issued at their nominal amount (which equals the denomination specified in the Final Terms).

The Notes may be offered at the issue price and/or at the reoffer price as specified in the Final Terms. If
specified in the Final Terms, the issue price at which retail investors may buy the Notes during the subscription
period is determined on the basis of the reoffer price for institutional investors plus selling fee of up to 1.5
percentage points or such other selling fee as specified in the Final Terms.

The Issuer will apply for the admission of the Programme to the Second Regulated Market (Geregelter
_Freiverkehr) of the Vienna Stock Exchange. This Prospectus applies with respect to the issuance of Notes to be_
listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange within a period of 12 months from the date of approval of this Prospectus.
The Programme also allows the issuance of Notes listed on other regulated (subject to the prior notification of
the Prospectus in accordance with Article 18 of the Prospectus Directive, and approval for listing) and
unregulated markets within the European Economic Area or not listed on any stock exchange, as indicated in the
respective Final Terms.

The Notes shall be cleared through one or more clearing systems, as specified in the Final Terms. These clearing
systems include, among others, those operated by OeKB CSD GmbH, Clearstream Banking AG, Clearstream
Banking société anonyme, Luxemburg und Euroclear.

Erste Group Bank AG will serve as listing agent and will, together with the Issuer, submit an application for
admission of the Programme to the Second Regulated Market (Geregelter Freiverkehr) of the Vienna Stock
Exchange.

Erste Group Bank AG will serve as initial principal paying agent under the Programme.

**2.** **Issuance procedure**

**_General_**

The Issuer and the respective Dealer(s) agree on the conditions that shall apply to a particular issuance of Notes
(the "Issuance Conditions"). These Issuance Conditions derive from the Terms and Conditions included under
Section VI.1 (Information Regarding the Notes) of this Prospectus, which are completed by the information
included in the Final Terms applicable to the Notes. The Issuance Conditions are thus prepared as follows:

`-` blanks in the Terms and Conditions are deemed completed by the information included in the Final Terms
as though in fact having been prepared with such information included;

`-` to the extent the Final Terms contemplate the completion of certain Terms and Conditions, the respective
provisions of the Terms and Conditions are considered completed accordingly thereby;

`-` alternative or selectable provisions of the Terms and Conditions whose application is not provided for in the
Final Terms or that are deleted are deemed not included in the Terms and Conditions; and


-----

`-` all instructions and explanations in the Terms and Conditions that are in square brackets are deemed not
included in the Terms and Conditions.

The Terms and Conditions and Final Terms will be annexed to each global note documenting the Notes of a
particular series.

**STEUERN**

(1) Sämtliche auf die Schuldverschreibungen zu
zahlenden Beträge sind ohne Einbehalt oder

zukünftigen Steuern oder sonstigen Abgaben
gleich welcher Art zu leisten, die von oder in
der Republik Österreich oder für deren

Rechnung oder von oder für Rechnung einer
Gebietskörperschaft oder Steuerbehörde der
oder in der Republik Österreich auferlegt oder
erhoben werden, es sei denn, ein solcher

solche Steuern und Abgaben, die:

(a) anders als durch Einbehalt oder

Abzug an der Quelle auf Zahlungen
von Kapital und Zinsen aus den

**TAXES**

**(1)** All amounts to be paid in respect of the
Notes have to be paid without any

withholding or deduction at the source for
any taxes or other duties, present or future,
of whatever nature as are imposed or levied
by or in or for the account of the Republic of
Austria, or by or for the account of any
political subdivision or any tax authority of
or in the Republic of Austria, unless such
withholding or deduction is required by law.
In such event, the Issuer will pay such
additional amounts (the Additional

Amounts) as are required to ensure that the
net amounts received by the Noteholders
after such withholding or deduction will in
each case correspond to the amounts of
principal and interest the Noteholders would
have received if no such withholding or
deduction had been made.

**(2)** However, there shall be no obligation to pay
such Additional Amounts with respect to
those taxes and duties:

(a) which have to be paid on any

payments of principal and interest
made under the Notes in a way
different from withholding or

deduction at the source; or

(b) which are payable because the

Noteholder,

(i) from the tax perspective, has a
relevant relationship with the
Republic of Austria other than
the mere circumstance of him
being the holder of the Notes; or

(ii) receives a payment of principal

or interest under the Notes from

**VII. TAXATION IN AUSTRIA**

**_The following summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all Austrian tax considerations_**
**_that may be relevant for the decision to acquire, to hold, and to dispose of the Notes and does not constitute_**
**_legal or tax advice. The summary is based on Austrian tax law and practice and official interpretation_**
**_currently in effect, all of which are subject to change. Future legislative, judicial or administrative changes_**
**_could modify the tax treatment described below and could affect the tax consequences for investors – also_**
**_retroactively. Prospective investors should consult their own independent advisers as to the implications of_**
**_their subscribing for, purchasing, holding, exchanging or disposing of the Notes under the laws of the_**
**_jurisdictions in which they may be subject to tax. The discussion of certain Austrian taxes set forth below is_**
**_included for information purposes only._**

This summary of Austrian tax issues is based on the assumption that the Notes are legally and actually publicly
offered. Further this summary assumes that the Notes do not qualify as equity for Austrian tax purposes or units
in a non-Austrian investment fund within the meaning of Sec 188 of the Austrian Investment Fund Act
(Investmentfondsgesetz, InvFG). The tax consequences may substantially differ if the Notes are qualified as
equity instruments or (in particular if issued by a non-Austrian entity) units in a non-Austrian investment fund
within the meaning of Sec 188 InvFG.

**1.** **Austrian tax resident individual investors**

Individuals, who have their domicile or habitual abode in Austria, are tax resident and subject to unlimited tax
liability in Austria. Hence their worldwide income is subject to income tax in Austria.

Interest and capital gains from the Notes realised by an investor resident in Austria for tax purposes are subject
to Austrian income tax generally at a special tax rate of 27.5%.

The tax base is generally considered to be the interest paid or, with respect to capital gains, the difference
between the sale proceeds or the redemption amount, in each case including accrued interest, and the acquisition
costs including accrued interest. Expenses which are directly connected with income subject to the special tax
rate of 27.5% are not deductible. For Notes held as private assets, the acquisition costs shall not include
incidental acquisition costs. For the calculation of the acquisition costs of Notes held within the same securities
account and having the same securities identification number but which are acquired at different points in time,
an average price shall apply.

If interest is paid by an Austrian paying agent (auszahlende Stelle; e.g. an Austrian credit institution, an Austrian
branch of a foreign credit institution or Austrian issuer) withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer) at a rate of 27.5%
is triggered. The income tax for interest income generally constitutes a final taxation (Endbesteuerung) for
individuals, irrespective of whether the Notes are held as private assets or as business assets. In relation to
realized capital gains and income from derivatives, withholding tax at a rate of 27.5% is triggered if the Notes
are deposited with an Austrian depository (e.g. an Austrian credit institution or Austrian branch of a nonAustrian credit institution) or if the payments are made by an Austrian paying agent provided the non-Austrian
depository is a non-Austrian branch or group company of such Austrian paying agent and processes the payment
in cooperation with the Austrian paying agent. In case of realized capital gains, the 27.5% withholding tax
deduction will result in final income taxation only for individuals holding the Notes as private assets provided
that the investor has evidenced the factual acquisition cost of the Notes to the securities depository. Capital gains
need to be included in the income tax return if realized as business income or employment income.

The Issuer does not assume responsibility for withholding tax at source.

In the absence of an Austrian paying agent or depository, the investor must include interest and capital gains in
the income tax return and such income is taxed at a rate of 27.5% unless a Swiss or Liechtenstein paying agent
has withheld final withholding tax under the respective Swiss or Liechtenstein withholding tax acts
implementing the bilateral withholding tax agreements with Switzerland (in force since 1 January 2013) and
Liechtenstein (in force since 1 January 2014) which final withholding tax discharges the investor's Austrian
income tax liability.

Income from Notes which are not legally or actually publicly offered within the meaning of the Austrian Income
Tax Act would not be subject to withholding tax and final taxation but subject to normal progressive personal
income tax rates of up to 55% and needs to be included in the investor's income tax return.


-----

Withdrawals (Entnahmen), the transfer of the investor’s tax residence or deposit account outside of Austria, the
transfer of the Notes to a non-resident without consideration or any other circumstances which lead to Austria
losing its taxation right with respect to the Notes are in general deemed as a disposal of the Notes resulting in
exit taxation.

As an exception to this general rule, withdrawals (Entnahmen) and other transfers of Notes from the securities
account are not treated as disposals (sales), if specified exemptions pursuant to Sec 27(6) no 2 EStG will be
fulfilled such as the transfer of the Notes to a securities account owned by the same taxpayer (i) with the same
Austrian securities depository (bank), (ii) with another Austrian bank if the account holder has instructed the
transferring bank to disclose the acquisition costs to the receiving bank or (iii) with a non-Austrian bank, if the
account holder has instructed the transferring bank to transmit the pertaining information to the competent tax
office within a month or (iv) has, in the case of transfers from a foreign account, himself notified the competent
Austrian tax office with the respective information within a month; or (v) like the transfer without consideration
to a securities account held by another taxpayer, if the fact that the transfer has been made without consideration
has been evidenced to the bank or the bank has been instructed to inform the Austrian tax office thereof or if the
taxpayer has himself notified the competent Austrian tax office within a month. Upon application of the
taxpayer, the exit taxation of the Notes held as private assets can be deferred until the actual disposal of the
Notes in case the investor transfers his or her tax residence outside of Austria to an EU member state or certain
member states of the European Economic Area or transfers the Notes for no consideration to another individual
resident in an EU member state or certain member states of the European Economic Area. In all other cases of a
deemed disposal the taxpayer may apply for a payment of the triggered income tax in instalments over a period
of seven years.

Losses from Notes held as private assets may only be set off with other investment income subject to the special
tax rate (excluding, inter alia, interest income from bank deposits and other claims against banks) and must not
be set off with any other income. Pursuant to Sec 93(6) EStG, Austrian securities depositories have to apply a
mandatory set-off of losses from securities accounts of the same taxpayer at the same securities depository
(subject to certain exemptions). A carry-forward of such losses is not permitted.

Taxpayers, whose regular personal income tax is lower than 27.5% may opt for taxation of the income derived
from the Notes at the regular (progressive) personal income tax rate. Any tax withheld will then be credited
against the income tax. Such application for opting into taxation at the regular personal income tax rate must,
however, include all income subject to the special 27.5% tax rate. However, even if the option for taxation at the
regular personal income tax rate is exercised, expenses in direct economic connection with such income are not
deductible.

If Notes are held as business assets, acquisition cost may also include incidental acquisition costs. Income
derived from the Notes is also subject to the special income tax rate of 27.5% deducted by way of the
withholding tax. However, realized capital gains and income from derivatives, contrary to interest income, are
not subject to final taxation and have to be included in the tax return and are also subject to the special income
tax rate of 27.5%. Write-downs and losses derived from the sale or redemption of Notes held as business assets
must primarily be set off against positive income from realized capital gains (including write-ups) of financial
instruments of the same business and only 55% of the remaining loss may be set off or carried forward against
any other income.

**2.** **Austrian private foundation**

Private foundations pursuant to the Austrian Private Foundations Act fulfilling the prerequisites contained in Sec
13(6) KStG and holding Notes as a non-business asset are subject to interim taxation at a rate of 25% (which is,
however, not levied to the extent/in case the private foundation makes distributions to beneficiaries which are
subject to Austrian withholding tax) on interest income, income from realised capital gains and income from
derivatives. Under the conditions set forth in Sec 94 no 12 EStG no withholding tax is levied.

**3.** **Austrian tax resident corporate investor**

A corporation (within the meaning of Sec 1 KStG) subject to unlimited corporate income tax liability in Austria
that receives income from the Notes will be subject to Austrian corporate income tax at a rate of 25%. While an
Austrian paying agent may – pursuant to Sec. 93(1a) EStG – limit tax withholding to 25%, the Austrian paying
agent may also choose instead to withhold 27.5% at source. In such latter case, corporations subject to unlimited
corporate income tax liability in Austria would be entitled to apply for a tax credit of the additional 2.5% so
withheld by the Austrian paying agent. A corporation may file an exemption declaration (Befreiungserklärung)


-----

pursuant to Sec 94 no 5 EStG in order to avoid that Austrian withholding tax is levied. Tax losses may generally
be offset against all other income. Tax loss carry forwards are generally possible.

**4.** **Non-Austrian tax resident investors**

Since 1 January 2015, interest within the meaning of the Austrian EU-Source Tax Act (EU-Quellensteuergesetz,
_EU-QuStG; implementing Directive 2003/48/EC of 3 June 2003) received by a recipient not covered by EC_
Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments (the "EU
**Savings Directive") may be subject to limited tax liability. As a consequence, in particular, non-EU-resident**
individuals and certain non-resident entities (e.g. if qualified as partnerships for Austrian tax purposes and
having at least one non-resident individual as partner) may be subject to such limited tax liability. It is a
prerequisite that the obligation to levy Austrian withholding tax is triggered. This is the case if interest is paid by
a paying agent located in Austria or by the issuer of the notes if paid directly to the investor.

Income from the Notes received by corporate investors that do not have their corporate seat or their place of
management in Austria (“non-Austrian residents”) is not taxable in Austria unless such income is attributable to
an Austrian permanent establishment.

Non-Austrian residents receiving income from the Notes through a paying agent or a depository located in
Austria may be exempt from Austrian withholding tax in accordance with § 94 no 5 and no 13 EStG. If Austrian
withholding tax is deducted, the tax withheld shall be refunded to the non-Austrian resident Noteholder upon
application.

Where non-Austrian residents receive income from the Notes as part of business income taxable in Austria (e.g.
permanent establishment), they will, in general, be subject to the same tax treatment as resident investors.

As of January 1, 2017 the limited tax liability regarding interest income from Austrian sources will change due
to the recently enacted EU-Abgabenänderungsgesetz 2016, EU-AbgÄG 2016:

As of January 1, 2017 the scope of the limited Austrian tax liability will include interest within the meaning of
the EStG including pro rata temporis interest realized upon sale or redemption generated, in particular, by
individuals and certain entities (e.g. if qualified as partnerships for Austrian tax purposes and having at least one
non-resident individual as partner) that are resident in a jurisdiction with which Austria is not exchanging tax
information on an automatic basis. The status of being tax resident in a jurisdiction with which Austria is
exchanging information on an automatic basis has to be evidenced by means of a certificate of residence. Like
under the current legislation it is a prerequisite that the obligation to levy Austrian withholding tax is triggered.
This is the case if interest is paid by a paying agent located in Austria or by the issuer of the notes if paid directly
to the investor. However, exemptions from Austrian withholding tax may apply (see above). Moreover, income
from the Notes received by corporate investors that do not have their seat or their place of management in
Austria, shall remain not taxable in Austria unless such income is attributable to an Austrian permanent
establishment.

**5.** **Austrian EU-Source Tax Act**

Under the Austrian EU-Source Tax Act (EU-Quellensteuergesetz, EU-QuStG; implementing the EU Savings
Directive), interest paid by an Austrian coupon-paying agent to an individual beneficial owner resident in
another EU member state is subject to EU source tax at a rate of 35%. Interest within the meaning of the EUQuStG are, among others, interest paid or credited to an account, relating to debt claims of every kind, whether
or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits, and, in
particular, income from government securities and income from notes or debentures, including premiums and
prizes attached to such securities, notes or debentures.

An exemption from EU source taxation applies, among others, if the beneficial owner of the interest forwards to
the Austrian paying agent documentation issued by the tax office where the tax payer is resident, stating (i) the
beneficial owner’s name, address and tax identification number (in the absence of a tax identification number the
beneficial owner’s date and place of birth), (ii) the paying agent’s name and address and (iii) the beneficial
owner’s account number or the security identification number. Further, EU source tax is not triggered if interest
within the meaning of the EU-QuStG is paid to an institution within the meaning of Sec 4(2) EU-QuStG resident
in another EU Member State and this institution agrees upon written request of the Austrian paying agent to
enter into a simplified information exchange procedure with the Austrian paying agent.


-----

The Issuer does not assume responsibility for the deduction of EU source tax at source and is not obliged to
make additional payments in case of withholding tax deductions at source.

Upon a proposal of the European Commission, the EU Savings Directive was repealed by the Council of the
European Union on 10 November 2015 which – in the case of Austria – will enter into effect as from 1 January,
2017 (on certain accounts Austria has undertaken to initiate automatic exchange of information from
30 September 2017 with respect to taxable periods beginning on or after 1 October 2016). Based on the EU_Abgabenänderungsgesetz 2016, the Austrian EU-Source Tax Act (EU-Quellensteuergesetz, EU-QuStG) will be_
repealed effective from 1 January, 2017 (specific transitional provisions may apply).

**6.** **Austrian inheritance and gift tax**

Austria does not levy an inheritance and gift tax.

However, certain gratuitous transfers of assets to (Austrian or foreign) private law foundations and comparable
legal estates (privatrechtliche Stiftungen und damit vergleichbare Vermögensmassen) are subject to foundation
entrance tax (Stiftungseingangssteuer) pursuant to the Austrian Foundation Entrance Tax Act

(Stiftungseingangssteuergesetz). Such tax is triggered if the transferor and/or the transferee at the time of transfer
have a domicile, their habitual abode, their legal seat or their place of effective management in Austria. Certain
exemptions apply in case of a transfer mortis causa, in particular for bank deposits and publicly placed notes.
The tax basis is the fair market value of the assets transferred minus any debts, calculated at the time of transfer.
The tax rate is in general 2.5%, with a higher rate of 25% applying in special cases.

In addition, a special notification obligation exists for gifts like e.g. money, receivables, shares in corporations,
participations in partnerships, businesses, movable tangible assets and intangibles. The notification obligation
applies if the donor and/or the donee have a domicile, their habitual abode, their legal seat or their place of
effective management in Austria. Not all gifts are covered by the notification obligation: In case of gifts to
certain related parties, a threshold of EUR 50,000 per year applies; in all other cases, a notification is obligatory
if the value of gifts made exceeds an amount of EUR 15,000 during a period of five years. Furthermore,
gratuitous transfers to foundations falling under the Austrian Foundation Tax Act described above are also
exempt from the notification obligation. Intentional violation of the notification obligation may lead to the
levying of penalties of up to 10% of the fair market value of the assets transferred.

**7.** **Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)**

On 29 April 2014, Austria concluded an intergovernmental agreement (Model II) with the United States in order
to facilitate the implementation of FATCA for Austrian financial institutions (i.e. custodial institutions,
depository institutions, investment entities or specific insurance companies) and to allow the provision of certain
information on accounts held by "U.S. Persons" to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). "U.S. Persons" are
considered U.S. citizens or resident individuals, partnerships or corporations organised in the United States or
under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, certain trusts (subject to the jurisdiction of a court within
the United States with one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the
trust) and an estate of a decedent that is a citizen or resident of the United States. If the respective U.S. account
holder does not allow the financial institution to forward account specific information to the IRS, the financial
institution is still obliged to forward aggregated information on the account to the IRS and such information may
serve as basis for group requests by the IRS to the Austrian tax administration in order to obtain more specific
information on such accounts.

It is to note that there is currently no guidance on the impact of FATCA and the intergovernmental agreement on
Austrian financial institutions and their reporting and withholding responsibilities. In particular, it is not yet
certain how the United States and Austria will implement withholding on "foreign passthru payments" (which
may include payments on the Notes) or if such withholding will be required at all.

U.S. Persons are advised to contact their tax advisor with respect to the consequences of FATCA and the
intergovernmental agreement on their investment.

**VIII.TAXATION IN GERMANY**

_The following discussion is a summary of certain material German tax considerations relating to (i) Notes issued_
_by the Issuer in particular where the holder is tax resident in Germany or has a tax presence in Germany or (ii)_
_Notes held through a disbursing agent located in Germany. It is based on the laws in force on the date of this_
_Prospectus, of general nature only and neither intended as, nor to be understood as, legal or tax advice. Any_
_information given hereafter reflects the opinion of the Issuer and must not be misunderstood as a representation_
_or guarantee with regard to potential tax consequences. Further, the Issuer advises that the tax consequences_
_depend on the individual facts and circumstances at the level of the investor and may be subject to future_
_changes in law._

**1.** **Withholding Tax**

For German tax residents (e.g. persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat or place of management is
located in Germany), interest payments on the Notes are subject to withholding tax, provided that the Notes are
held in custody with a German custodian, who is required to deduct the withholding tax from such interest
payments (the "Disbursing Agent"). Disbursing Agents are German resident credit institutions, financial
services institutions (including German branches of foreign financial companies), German securities trading
companies or German securities trading banks. The applicable withholding tax rate is 25% (plus 5.5% solidarity
surcharge thereon and, if applicable, church tax). The withholding tax will be reduced by 25 % of the church tax.

For individuals subject to church tax, church tax will be collected by the Disbursing Agent by way of
withholding unless the investor has filed a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal Central Tax
Office (Bundeszentralamt für Steuern) in which case the investor has to include the relevant investment income
in the tax return in order to be assessed to church tax.

The withholding tax regime should also apply to any gains from the disposition or redemption of Notes as well
as to comparable transactions realised by private investors holding the Notes as private (and not as business)
assets in custody with a Disbursing Agent. Subject to exceptions, the amount of capital gains on which the
withholding tax charge is applied is generally levied on the difference between the proceeds received upon the
disposition or redemption of the Notes or comparable transactions and (after the deduction of actual expenses
directly related thereto) the acquisition costs. Where the Notes are acquired and/or sold in a currency other than
Euro, the sales/redemption price and the acquisition costs have to be converted into Euro on the basis of the
foreign exchange rates prevailing on the sale or redemption date and the acquisition date respectively. Where
custody of the Notes has changed from a Disbursing Agent or an EU/EEA-resident credit institution or financial
services institution to a new Disbursing Agent since the acquisition and the acquisition data is not allowed to be
proven to the new Disbursing Agent or is not provided in the form required by law, the tax at a rate of 25% (plus
5.5% solidarity surcharge and, if applicable, church tax) will be imposed on an amount equal to 30% of the
proceeds from the sale or redemption of the Notes (or comparable amounts).

Accrued interest (Stückzinsen) received by the investor upon disposal of the Notes between two interest payment
dates is considered as part of the sales proceeds thus increasing a capital gain or reducing a capital loss from the
Notes. Accrued interest paid by the investor upon an acquisition of the Notes after the issue date qualifies as
negative investment income either to be deducted from positive investment income generated in the same
assessment period or to be carried forward to future assessment periods.

German withholding tax should generally not be levied if a non-business investor has filed a withholding tax
exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the Disbursing Agent, but only to the extent the annual
aggregate investment income does not exceed the maximum lump sum deduction amount (Sparer-Pauschbetrag)
shown on the withholding tax exemption certificate. Currently, the maximum lump sum deduction amount is
EUR 801 (EUR 1,602 for married couples and registered partners filing jointly) for all investment income
received in a given calendar year. Similarly, no withholding tax should be levied if the investor has submitted to
the Disbursing Agent a certificate of non-assessment (Nichtveranlagungs-Bescheinigung) issued by the
competent local tax office.

In the case of Notes held as business assets if (a) the investor qualifies as a German tax resident corporation,
association of persons (Personenvereinigung) or estate of assets (Vermögensmasse) or (b) the Notes are
attributed to a domestic business in Germany and the investor notifies this to the Disbursing Agent in the
officially required form, capital gains from the disposal, sale or redemption of the Notes should not be subject to
withholding tax.


-----

The Issuer does not assume any responsibility for the deduction of German withholding tax at the source
(including solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax thereon).

**2.** **Private Investors**

For German tax resident private investors the withholding tax is – without prejudice to certain exceptions –
definitive under a special flat tax regime (Abgeltungsteuer) as regards interest and gains resulting from the
disposition or redemption of the Notes. Under the flat tax regime, expenses actually incurred in connection with
the investment into the Notes are generally not tax-deductible. Only actual expenses directly related to proceeds
received upon the disposition or redemption of the Notes or comparable transactions can be tax-deductible.
According to the German tax authorities, no sale is deemed to occur where the sales proceeds do not exceed the
transaction costs. In such case, losses resulting from the disposal of the Notes are treated as non-deductible for
German taxation purposes. Similarly, losses from a disposal of the Notes are non-deductible where, based on an
agreement with the depositary institution, the transaction costs are calculated on the basis of the sale proceeds
taking into account a deductible amount. Further, losses resulting from a bad debt loss (Forderungsausfall) in the
case of an Issuer default or from a waiver of a receivable (Forderungsverzicht) in relation to the Notes, to the
extent the waiver does not qualify as a hidden contribution, are not treated as tax-deductible.

Private investors can apply to have their income from the investment into the Notes assessed in accordance with
the general rules on determining an individual's tax bracket if this results in a lower tax burden. Also in this case,
expenses actually incurred are not deductible. An assessment is mandatory for income from the investment into
the Notes where the Notes are held in custody outside of Germany and where a private investor who is liable to
German church tax has applied for a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk). Losses resulting from the sale or
redemption of the Notes can only be off-set against other investment income. In the event that, absent sufficient
positive investment income, a set-off is not possible in the assessment period in which the losses have been
realised, such losses can be carried forward in order to be offset against any positive investment income
generated in future assessment periods.

**3.** **Business Investors**

Interest payments and capital gains from the disposition or redemption of the Notes or comparable transactions
held as business assets by German tax resident business investors are generally subject to (i) corporate income
tax at a rate of 15% or income tax at a rate of up to 45%, as the case may be (in each case plus 5.5% solidarity
surcharge thereon and, if applicable in the case of an individual holding the Notes as business assets, church tax),
and (ii) trade tax which generally ranges from 7% to approximately 18.2%. Any German withholding tax
deducted from interest payments or, if applicable, from capital gains, is – as a general rule and subject to certain
requirements – creditable against the German (corporate) income tax liability, or, to the extent exceeding the
(corporate) income tax liability, refundable. The interest payments and capital gains are also subject to trade tax,
if the Notes are attributable to a German trade or business.

**4.** **Foreign Tax Residents**

Investors not resident in Germany should, in essence, not be taxable in Germany with the proceeds from the
investment in the Notes (interest payments and capital gains), and no German withholding tax should be
withheld from such income, even if the Notes are held in custody with a German credit (or comparable)
institution. Exceptions apply, e.g., where (i) the Notes are held as business assets in a German permanent
establishment of the investor or (ii) the income otherwise constitutes German source income (such as income
from the letting and leasing of certain German-situs property or interest income from capital investments directly
or indirectly secured by German-situs real estate, unless the Notes qualify as global notes (Sammelurkunden)
within the meaning of Section 9a of the German Custody Act (Depotgesetz) or as fungible notes representing the
same issue (Schuldverschreibungen)). In case (i) a tax regime similar to that explained above for tax resident
Business Investors applies (see above ––“Business Investors”). In case (ii), where no withholding tax has been
deducted, an assessment is mandatory for non-resident investors. However, if the interest payments and capital
gains are part of further German source income (e.g. income from leasing) withholding tax has to be deducted
and an assessment might be mandatory due to this further income. Subject to certain requirements a holder who
is not tax-resident in Germany may benefit from tax reductions or tax exemptions provided by an applicable tax
treaty. Moreover, a non-resident investor may be subject to tax with any income derived from the Notes in the
jurisdiction where such investor is tax resident.


-----

**5.** **Treatment under the Investment Tax Act**

The Issuer takes the view that the special provisions of the Investment Tax Act (Investmentsteuergesetz) are not
applicable to the Notes.

**6.** **German implementation of the former EU Savings Tax Directive**

On 10 November 2015, the European Commission repealed the EU Savings Tax Directive generally with effect
as of 1 January 2016 in order to prevent an overlap between the EU Savings Tax Directive and the EU Council
Directive 2011/16/EU on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation (as amended by EU Council
Directive 2014/107/EU dated 9 December 2014) pursuant to which an automatic exchange of information
regime has to be implemented between the EU member states generally with effect as of 1 January 2016. The
implementation of the EU Savings Tax Directive in Germany by the decree on the taxation of interest income
(Zinsinformationsverordnung) has generally also been repealed with effect as of 1 January 2016. However, it
continues to remain in effect for some countries (Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg) with regard to withholding tax
which has to be levied in 2016. Pursuant to the decree, a domestic paying agent (within the meaning of the
decree) is required to provide to the Federal Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für Steuern) details of the payment of
interest made to any individual resident in another EU Member State as the beneficial owner of the interest. The
Federal Tax Office is then required to communicate this information to the competent authority of the other EU
Member State of which the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident.

**7.** **Inheritance and Gift Tax**

No inheritance or gift taxes with respect to the Notes will generally arise under German law, if, in the case of
inheritance tax, neither the decedent nor the beneficiary, or, in the case of gift tax, neither the donor nor the
donee, is a resident of the Federal Republic of Germany and such Notes are not attributable to a German trade or
business for which a permanent establishment is maintained, or a permanent representative has been appointed in
the Federal Republic of Germany. Exceptions from this rule apply to certain German citizens who previously
maintained a residence in the Federal Republic of Germany. Subject to certain requirements a holder who is not
tax-resident in Germany may benefit from tax reductions or tax exemptions provided by an applicable
inheritance and gift tax treaty.

**8.** **Other Taxes**

At present, the purchase, sale or other disposal of Notes does not give rise to capital transfer tax, value added tax,
stamp duties or similar taxes or charges in Germany. However, under certain circumstances entrepreneurs may
opt for a liability to value added tax with regard to the sales of Notes which would otherwise be tax exempt. Net
wealth tax (Vermögensteuer) is, at present, not levied in Germany.

subscribe the Notes, as the same may be varied in that Member State by any measure implementing the
Prospectus Directive in that Member State and the expression "Prospectus Directive" means Directive

**XI.** **GENERAL INFORMATION**

**1.** **Authorisation**

The preparation of this Prospectus was duly authorised by the Managing Board of the Issuer on 30 August 2016.
On the same day, the Supervisory Board of the Issuer approved the preparation of this Prospectus.

**2.** **Auditor**

The Consolidated Financial Statements prepared by the Issuer’s management board in accordance with IFRS, as
adopted by the EU, for the 2015 financial year ending 31 December 2015 and for the 2014 financial year ending
31 December 2014, were audited by Deloitte Audit Wirtschaftsprüfungs GmbH, which is domiciled in Vienna
and has a business address at Renngasse 1/Freyung, 1010 Vienna and which issued unqualified audit opinions
dated 19 April 2016 and 17 April 2015, respectively. Deloitte Audit Wirtschaftsprüfungs GmbH is a member of
both the Institute of Public Auditors in Austria (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer) and the Austrian Chamber of
Public Accountants and Tax Advisors (Kammer der Wirtschaftstreuhänder).

**3.** **Admission to trading**

The Issuer will apply for the admission of the Programme to the Second Regulated Market (Geregelter
_Freiverkehr) of the Vienna Stock Exchange. This Prospectus applies with respect to the issuance of Notes to be_
listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange within a period of 12 months from the date of approval of this Prospectus.

The Programme also allows the issuance of Notes listed on other regulated (subject to the prior notification of
the Prospectus in accordance with Article 18 of the Prospectus Directive and subsequent approval) and
unregulated markets within the European Economic Area or not listed on any stock exchange, as indicated in the
respective Final Terms.

**4.** **Currency of the Notes**

The Notes may be denominated in any currency if the Issuer and the relevant Dealers so agree. All payments of
interest and principal shall be in such currency.

**5.** **Use of proceeds**

The Issuer intends to use the proceeds from the sale of the Notes primarily for the optimization of the financing
structure, for example by repaying outstanding lines of credit, but also for possible acquisitions (including the
acquisitions of shares of Ainsworth Game Technology Ltd. or the increase of existing shareholdings), future
investments in ongoing operations and fixed and financial assets, as well as for general corporate purposes.

**6.** **Ranking of the Notes**

The Notes are unsecured, unconditional and unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer and rank pari passu without
any preference among themselves and equally with all other outstanding, unsecured and unsubordinated
obligations of the Issuer present and future, unless such obligations are accorded priority under mandatory
provisions of statutory law. This includes, for example, the costs of insolvency proceedings or claims by
employees relating to current wages following the opening of insolvency proceedings.

**7.** **Reoffer Price and Issue Price**

Notes will be issued at their nominal amount (which equals the denomination specified in the Final Terms).

The Notes may be offered at the issue price and/or at the reoffer price as specified in the Final Terms. If
specified in the Final Terms, the issue price at which retail investors may buy the Notes during the subscription
period is determined on the basis of the reoffer price for institutional investors plus selling fee of up to 1.5
percentage points or such other selling fee as specified in the Final Terms.

**8.** **Calculation of yield**

The yield is calculated on the basis of the actual/actual ICMA method (on the assumption that the Notes are held
to maturity and are acquired at the reoffer price, if applicable, or the issue price). The ICMA method determines
the effective interest rate of the Notes taking into account accrued interest on a daily basis.


-----

**9.** **Rating**

The Issuer is assigned a long-term issuer rating of "BBB" with stable outlook and a short-term issuer rating of
"A-2" with stable outlook by Standard & Poor’s.

In general, European regulated investors are restricted from using a rating for regulatory purposes if such rating
is not issued by a credit rating agency established in the European Union and registered under Regulation (EC)
No. 1060/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 on credit rating agencies
(as amended) (the "CRA Regulation"), unless the rating is provided by a credit rating agency operating in the
European Union before 7 June 2010 which has submitted an application for registration in accordance with the
CRA Regulation and such registration has not been refused.

Standard & Poor’s Credit Market Services Europe Limited, has its registered office at 20 Canada Square, Canary
Wharf, London, United Kingdom E14 5LH and is a business unit of The McGraw-Hill Companies Inc. whose
headquarter is at 1221 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10020. Standard & Poor's assigns long-term
credit ratings on a scale from "AAA" to "D". The ratings from "AA" to "CCC" can be modified by a "+" or "-" to
indicate the relative position within the main rating category. Additionally, Standard & Poor's can provide an
estimation (known as Credit Watch) as to whether a rating will be upgraded, downgraded or whether the trend is
uncertain (neutral). Standard & Poor's can assign specific issues short-term ratings on a scale from "A-1", "A-2",
"A-3", "B", "C" down to "D". Within the "A-1" class, the rating can be given a "+".

Standard & Poor's Credit Market Services Europe Limited is established in the European Union and is included
as a registered rating agency in the list of credit rating agencies published by the European Securities and
Markets Authority on its website in accordance with the CRA Regulation.

A rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to suspension, reduction or
withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.

**10.** **Interests of natural and legal persons involved in the issue/offer**

The Dealers and their affiliates have provided or provide various banking, financial advisory and/or similar
services to the Issuer in the ordinary course of business and maintain ordinary business relationships with the
Issuer in their capacity as credit institutions or as lenders under credit facilities for which they have received and
may continue to receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses. Furthermore, NOVOMATIC AG Group
has entered into agreements to acquire stakes from Leipnik-Lundenburger Invest as well as of UNIQA Insurance
Group in connection with Casinos Austria Transactions. There are direct and indirect shareholders of Raiffeisen
Bank International AG, an Arranger and Dealer under the Programme, including Raiffeisen Zentralbank
Österreich, which are also indirect shareholders of Leipnik-Lundenburger Invest as well as of UNIQA Insurance
Group.

The net proceeds from the sale of the Notes may be used to repay outstanding obligations towards the Dealers or
their affiliates. Furthermore, the Dealers are expected to receive a management/underwriting commission or a
selling fee in an amount as specified in the relevant Final Terms.
