1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to the Actavis Generics Acquisition,1.1.1,"If the Actavis Generics acquisition is consummated, generics will be a significantly larger component of our business.","For the year ended December 31, 2015, our generics segment represented approximately 49% of our revenues. Following the completion of the Actavis Generics acquisition, the percentage of our revenues and profits attributable to sales of generics is expected to increase substantially. Generic pharmaceuticals are, as a general matter, less profitable than specialty pharmaceuticals, and due to the size of the acquisition, it is unlikely that the proportion of revenues attributable to generic pharmaceuticals, which will move from less than half before the acquisition to nearly two-thirds afterward, will change significantly over the next few years. Accordingly, we will be more dependent on our generics business and increasingly subject to market and regulatory factors affecting generic pharmaceuticals worldwide.",,,,,,N/A
1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to the Actavis Generics Acquisition,1.1.2,We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Actavis Generics acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating Actavis Generics.,"Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Actavis Generics acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate the Actavis Generics business. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. The nature of a carve out acquisition makes it inherently more difficult to assume operations on closing day as well as to integrate activities, as certain systems, processes and people may not all transfer with the acquired business to support such activities. As a result, we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrate the business practices and operations of Teva and Actavis Generics. The integration process may disrupt the businesses and, if implemented ineffectively, would restrict the realization of the full expected benefits. The failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the activities of the combined businesses and could adversely affect the results of operations of the combined businesses. In addition, the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customers and other business relationships, and diversion of management’s attention. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others: - the diversion of management’s attention to integration matters; - difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the combination; 10 ----- - difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; - conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures between the two companies; - difficulties in the assimilation of employees; - difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company; - challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers; - challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel; and - coordinating a geographically dispersed organization. Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could materially impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of the combined company. In addition, even if the Actavis Generics operations are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the transaction and other pending acquisitions may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are expected. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of Teva and Actavis Generics. All of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the transaction, and negatively impact the price of our debt and other securities. As a result, it cannot be assured that the Actavis Generics acquisition will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from such transaction.",,,,,,N/A
1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to the Actavis Generics Acquisition,1.1.3,"As a result of this offering and other contemplated financings in connection with the Actavis Generics acquisition, we will have a substantially higher level of indebtedness, which will increase our expenses and could adversely affect our business, including by restricting our ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness or resulting in a downgrade or other adverse action with respect to our credit rating.","In connection with the Actavis Generics acquisition, we expect that we will borrow approximately $28 billion through various debt financings, including the notes offered by this offering memorandum. Accordingly, following the completion of the acquisition, giving effect to the incurrence of debt, our consolidated debt is expected to be approximately $38 billion. As a result, our borrowing costs will increase significantly. This substantial level of debt could have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to: - reducing the benefits we expect to receive from the Actavis Generics acquisition; - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations; - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing; - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions; 11 ----- - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; - placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged; and - restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities.",,,,,,N/A
1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to the Actavis Generics Acquisition,1.1.4,We expect our credit ratings to be downgraded as a result of the Actavis Generics acquisition.,"Our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital. Our ratings at any time will reflect each rating organization’s then opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations. Following the announcement of the Actavis Generics acquisition, Standard and Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) downgraded our ratings to BBB and Baa1, respectively. Moody’s is expected to further downgrade our ratings in connection with the consummation of the Actavis Generics acquisition to Baa2 (as it already has with respect to the notes). Any reduction in our credit ratings may limit our ability to borrow at interest rates consistent with the interest rates that have been available to us prior to the Actavis Generics acquisition. If our credit ratings are downgraded or put on watch for a potential downgrade, we may not be able to sell additional debt securities or borrow money in the amounts, at the times or interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available if our current credit ratings are maintained.",,,,,,N/A
1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to the Actavis Generics Acquisition,1.1.5,"We expect that, for a period of time following the consummation of the Actavis Generics acquisition, we will have significantly less cash on hand than prior to the closing. This reduced amount of cash could adversely affect our ability to grow.","We are expected to have, for a period of time following the consummation of the Actavis Generics acquisition, significantly less cash and cash equivalents on hand than the approximately $6.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents that we had as of March 31, 2016. Although our management believes that we will have access to cash sufficient to meet our business objectives and capital needs, the lessened availability of cash and cash equivalents for a period of time following the consummation of the Actavis Generics acquisition could constrain our ability to grow our business. Our more leveraged financial position following the Actavis Generics acquisition could also make us vulnerable to general economic downturns and industry conditions, and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that have more cash at their disposal. In the event that we do not have adequate capital to maintain or develop our business, additional capital may not be available to us on a timely basis, on favorable terms, or at all.",,,,,,N/A
1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to the Actavis Generics Acquisition,1.1.6,The Master Purchase Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the Actavis Generics acquisition may not be completed.,"The Master Purchase Agreement contains a number of conditions that must be fulfilled to complete the acquisition. Those conditions primarily consist of EU antitrust approval (which has been obtained), U.S. antitrust approval and other customary conditions, including, among others, (i) the accuracy of representations and warranties and compliance with covenants and (ii) the absence of any material adverse effect with respect to Actavis Generics or Teva. The Master Purchase Agreement contains certain customary termination rights, including, among others, the right of either party to terminate the Master Purchase Agreement if the closing has not occurred by October 26, 2016. While we intend to use the proceeds of this offering to fund the Actavis Generics acquisition, this offering is not contingent on the completion of the Actavis Generics acquisition. In addition, if the Master Purchase Agreement is terminated in specified circumstances, certain termination fees become payable. 12 ----- If the closing of the Actavis Generics acquisition does not occur on or prior to October 26, 2016, or if the Master Purchase Agreement is terminated at any time prior thereto, the notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from the date of initial issuance of the notes up to, but not including, the special redemption date, as defined under “Description of the Notes and the Guarantees—Special Mandatory Redemption.” See “—Risks Related to the Notes—If the closing of the Actavis Generics acquisition _does not occur on or prior to October 26, 2016, or if the Master Purchase Agreement is terminated at any time prior thereto, you may not obtain your expected return on the notes.”_",,,,,,N/A
1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to the Actavis Generics Acquisition,1.1.7,"Teva and Allergan must obtain U.S. antitrust approval to consummate the Actavis Generics acquisition, which if delayed or not granted or granted with unacceptable conditions, may prevent, delay or jeopardize the consummation of the transaction, result in additional expenditures of money and resources and/or reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction.","Consummation of the Actavis Generics acquisition requires approval by the FTC, which has broad discretion in administering the governing regulations. We can provide no assurance that the required U.S. antitrust approval will be obtained. Moreover, as a condition to its approval of the transaction, the FTC has required various divestitures and may impose additional requirements, limitations or costs, further divestitures and/or place restrictions on the conduct of the business of the combined company after the closing of the acquisition. Any one of these requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions may delay the effective time of the acquisition and may reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction. In addition, if the Master Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances by Allergan or Teva due to failure to obtain necessary U.S. antitrust approvals, then we must pay Allergan $1 billion. In addition, as described above, the notes are subject to a special mandatory redemption. See “—Risks Related to the Notes—If the closing of the _Actavis Generics acquisition does not occur on or prior to October 26, 2016, or if the Master Purchase Agreement is terminated at any time prior thereto, you may not obtain your expected return on the notes” and_ “Description of the Notes and the Guarantees—Special Mandatory Redemption.” In connection with the closing of the Actavis Generics acquisition, due to regulatory requirements, Teva expects to divest products with aggregate revenues in 2015 of approximately $1.1 billion.",,,,,,N/A
1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to the Actavis Generics Acquisition,1.1.8,We will incur direct and indirect costs as a result of the Actavis Generics acquisition.,"We will incur substantial expenses in connection with and as a result of completing the Actavis Generics acquisition and, over a period of time following the completion of the Actavis Generics acquisition, we further expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with coordinating our businesses, operations, policies and procedures with that of Actavis Generics. While we have assumed that a certain level of transaction expenses will be incurred, factors beyond our control could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately.",,,,,,N/A
1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.2,Risks Related to Teva,1.2.1,Our success depends on our ability to develop and commercialize additional pharmaceutical products.,"Our financial results depend upon our ability to develop and commercialize additional generic and specialty pharmaceutical products, particularly after the expiration of our patents covering the 20mg/mL version of our leading specialty medicine, Copaxone[®], and patent challenges and expirations facing the 40mg/mL version of Copaxone[®] and certain of our other specialty medicines. Commercialization requires that we successfully develop, test and manufacture both generic and specialty products. All of our products must receive 13 ----- regulatory approval and meet (and continue to comply with) regulatory and safety standards; if health or safety concerns arise with respect to a product, we may be forced to withdraw it from the market. The development and commercialization process, particularly with respect to specialty medicines as well as the complex generic medicines that we are increasingly focusing on, is both time-consuming and costly and involves a high degree of business risk. Our products currently under development, if and when fully developed and tested, may not perform as we expect. Necessary regulatory approvals may not be obtained in a timely manner, if at all, and we may not be able to produce and market such products successfully and profitably. Delays in any part of the process or our inability to obtain regulatory approval of our products could adversely affect our operating results by restricting or delaying our introduction of new products.",,,,,,N/A
1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.2,Risks Related to Teva,1.2.2,"Our leading specialty medicine, Copaxone[®], faces increasing competition, including from orally- administered therapies and a competing generic version.","Any substantial decrease in the revenues derived from our specialty medicines would have an adverse effect on our results of operations, several of which currently face, or will soon face, intense competition. Our multiple sclerosis franchise includes our Copaxone[®] products and laquinimod (a developmental compound for the treatment of MS). The profitability of our multiple sclerosis franchise reflects Copaxone[®] revenues less cost of goods sold and selling and marketing (“S&M”) and R&D expenses related to our MS franchise. It does not include G&A expenses, amortization and non-recurring items. Our MS franchise profitability was $3.1 billion, $3.2 billion, and $3.3 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Profitability of our multiple sclerosis franchise as a percentage of Copaxone[®] revenues was 77%, 75% and 76% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Although Copaxone[®] remains the leading therapy for multiple sclerosis to date, the market for MS treatments continues to change significantly as a result of new and emerging therapies. In particular, the increasing number of oral treatments, such as Tecfidera[®] by Biogen, Gilenya[®] by Novartis, and Aubagio[®] by Genzyme, continue to present significant and increasing competition. The new oral treatments provide especially intense competition in light of their substantial convenience in comparison to injectables such as Copaxone[®]. As our U.S. Orange Book patents on Copaxone[®] 20mg/mL have expired, a competing generic version of this product was launched in the United States in June 2015. Copaxone[®] also continues to face competition from existing injectable products, such as the four beta-interferons Avonex[®], Betaseron[®], Extavia[®] and Rebif[®], as well as from the two monoclonal antibodies Tysabri[®] and Lemtrada[®]. Our business strategy for Copaxone[®] relies heavily on the continued migration of a substantial percentage of current daily Copaxone[®] patients to a new 40mg/mL, three-times-a-week version and the maintenance of patients on this new version. Four of our U.S. Orange Book patents for this new version are being challenged as well. The failure to achieve and maintain our objectives for Copaxone[®] 40mg/mL would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flow.",,,,,,N/A
1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.2,Risks Related to Teva,1.2.3,"We may be subject to material fines, penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our ongoing FCPA investigations and related matters.","We are required to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and similar anti corruption laws in other jurisdictions around the world where we do business. Compliance with these laws has been the subject of increasing focus and activity by regulatory authorities in recent years. Actions by our employees, or by third-party intermediaries acting on our behalf, in violation of such laws, whether carried out in the United States or elsewhere in connection with the conduct of our business (including our business practices currently under investigation, as described below) may expose us to liability for violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws and accordingly may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business, financial condition or results of operations. For several years, we have been conducting a voluntary worldwide investigation into business practices that may have implications under the FCPA. We have engaged outside counsel to assist in the investigation, 14 ----- which was prompted by the receipt, beginning in 2012, of subpoenas and informal document requests from the SEC and the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) to produce documents with respect to compliance with the FCPA in certain countries. We have provided, and will continue to provide, documents and other information to the SEC and the DOJ, and are cooperating with these agencies in their investigations of these matters. In the course of our investigation, which is substantially complete, we have identified certain business practices and transactions in Russia, certain European countries, certain Latin American countries and other countries in which we conduct business, which likely constitute violations of the FCPA and/or local law. In connection with our investigation, we have also become aware that affiliates in certain countries under investigation provided to local authorities inaccurate or altered information relating to marketing or promotional practices. We have brought and continue to bring these issues to the attention of the SEC and the DOJ. Although our internal investigation is substantially complete, additional issues or facts could become known to management as the investigation continues, which may expand the scope or severity of the potential violations and/or extend to additional jurisdictions. Our investigation is expected to be completed in 2016, but may continue beyond that date. We cannot predict at this time the impact on the Company as a result of these matters and accordingly cannot assure you that we will not be materially and adversely affected. The DOJ, SEC and other agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose (on the Company and/or individuals) for violations of the FCPA and other similar laws. We may be required to pay material fines and/or penalties and/or disgorge any profits earned from improper conduct. Our operations in the affected countries may be negatively impacted, and we may be subject to injunctions or limitations on future conduct, be required to modify our business practices and compliance programs and/or have a compliance monitor imposed on us, or suffer other criminal or civil penalties or adverse impacts, including lawsuits by private litigants or investigations and fines imposed by local authorities. In addition, there can be no assurance that the remedial measures we have taken and will take in the future will be effective or that there will not be a finding of a material weakness in our internal controls. Any one or more of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business, financial condition or results of operations.",,,,,,N/A
1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.2,Risks Related to Teva,1.2.4,Investments in our pipeline of specialty and other products may not achieve expected results.,"We must invest significant resources to develop specialty medicines (including our strategic focus on developing new therapeutic entities, as well as the development of complex generics), both through our own efforts and through collaborations and in-licensing or acquisition of products from or with third parties. In particular, in light of the expiration of our patents covering the 20mg/mL version of our leading specialty medicine, Copaxone[®], and patent challenges and expirations facing certain of our other specialty medicines, we have increased our investments in the acquisition and development of products to build our specialty pipeline, including through our recent acquisitions and in-licensing of Auspex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Eagle Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Labrys Biologics, Inc. The development of specialty medicines involves processes and expertise different from those used in the development of generic medicines, which increases the risks of failure that we face. For example, the time from discovery to commercial launch of a specialty medicine can be 15 years or even longer, and involves multiple stages: not only intensive preclinical and clinical testing, but also highly complex, lengthy and expensive approval processes which can vary from country to country. The longer it takes to develop a product, the less time there will be for us to recover our development costs and generate profits. During each stage, we may encounter obstacles that delay the development process and increase expenses, leading to significant risks that we will not achieve our goals and may be forced to abandon a potential product in which we have invested substantial amounts of time and money. These obstacles may include: preclinical failures; difficulty enrolling patients in clinical trials; delays in completing formulation and other work needed to support an application for approval; adverse reactions or other safety concerns arising during 15 ----- clinical testing; insufficient clinical trial data to support the safety or efficacy of the product candidate; and failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, the required regulatory approvals for the product candidate or the facilities in which it is manufactured. For example, we recently received a Complete Response Letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regarding our New Drug Application for SD-809 (deutetrabenazine) tablets for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington’s disease. We also recently announced the voluntary suspension of sales, marketing and distribution of Zecuity[®], a prescription transdermal system approved by the FDA for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults, following reports of adverse reactions in certain patients. Because of the amounts required to be invested in augmenting our pipeline of specialty and other products, we are also reliant on partnerships and joint ventures with third parties, and consequently face the risk that some of these third parties may fail to perform their obligations, or fail to reach the levels of success that we are relying on to meet our revenue and profit goals. There is a trend in the specialty pharmaceutical industry of seeking to “outsource” drug development by acquiring companies with promising drug candidates, and we face substantial competition from historically innovative companies for such acquisition targets.",,,,,,N/A
1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.2,Risks Related to Teva,1.2.5,"We may not be able to find or successfully bid for suitable acquisition targets or licensing opportunities, or consummate and integrate future acquisitions.","As a key part of our strategy, we continue to evaluate or pursue potential acquisitions, collaborations and licenses, among other transactions. Our reliance on acquisitions and other transactions as sources of new specialty and other products, or a means of growth, involves risks that could adversely affect our future revenues and operating results. For example: - We may fail to identify transactions that would enable us to execute our business strategy. - Competition in the pharmaceutical industry for target companies and development programs has intensified and has resulted in decreased availability of, or increased prices for, suitable transactions. - We may not be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, including those of competition authorities, and as a result, or for other reasons, we may fail to consummate an announced acquisition. - The negotiation of additional transactions may divert management’s attention from our existing business operations, resulting in the loss of key customers and/or personnel and exposing us to unanticipated liabilities. - We may fail to integrate acquisitions successfully in accordance with our business strategy or achieve expected synergies and other results. - We may not be able to retain experienced management and skilled employees from the businesses we acquire and, if we cannot retain such personnel, we may not be able to attract new skilled employees and experienced management to replace them. - We may purchase a company that has excessive known or unknown contingent liabilities, including, among others, patent infringement or product liability claims.",,,,,,N/A
1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.2,Risks Related to Teva,1.2.6,"Manufacturing or quality control problems may damage our reputation for quality production, demand costly remedial activities and negatively impact our financial results.","As a pharmaceutical company, we are subject to substantial regulation by various governmental authorities. For instance, we must comply with requirements of the FDA, European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”) and other healthcare regulators with respect to the manufacture, labeling, sale, distribution, marketing, 16 ----- advertising, promotion and development of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply strictly with these regulations and requirements may damage our reputation and lead to financial penalties, compliance expenditures, the recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, suspension of the applicable regulator’s review of our submissions, enforcement actions, injunctions and criminal prosecution. We must register our facilities, whether located in the United States or elsewhere, with the FDA as well as regulators outside the United States, and our products must be made in a manner consistent with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”), or similar standards in each territory in which we manufacture. In addition, the FDA and other agencies periodically inspect our manufacturing facilities. Following an inspection, an agency may issue a notice listing conditions that are believed to violate cGMP or other regulations, or a warning letter for violations of “regulatory significance” that may result in enforcement action if not promptly and adequately corrected. In recent years, there has been increasing regulatory scrutiny of pharmaceutical manufacturers, resulting in product recalls, plant shutdowns and other required remedial actions. We have been subject to increasing scrutiny of our manufacturing operations, and in previous years several of our facilities have been the subject of significant regulatory actions requiring substantial expenditures of resources to ensure compliance with more stringently applied production and quality control regulations. These regulatory actions also adversely affected our ability to supply various products worldwide and to obtain new product approvals at such facilities. If any regulatory body were to require one or more of our significant manufacturing facilities to cease or limit production, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, because regulatory approval to manufacture a drug is site-specific, the delay and cost of remedial actions, or obtaining approval to manufacture at a different facility also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Following the completion of the Actavis Generics acquisition, our manufacturing network will increase substantially. If we determine that any of the new facilities have quality or environmental issues, we could experience production or supply disruptions or be required to expend unanticipated costs on remediation and repairs. In addition, any delays in product transfers between our existing facilities and the newly-acquired sites may result in such disruptions.",,,,,,N/A
1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.2,Risks Related to Teva,1.2.7,"Our patent settlement agreements, which are important to our business, face increased government scrutiny in both the U.S. and Europe, and may expose us to significant damages.","We have been involved in numerous litigations involving challenges to the validity or enforceability of listed patents (including our own), and therefore settling patent litigations has been and is likely to continue to be an important part of our business. Parties to such settlement agreements in the U.S., including us, are required by law to file them with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ for review. The FTC has publicly stated that, in its view, some of the brand-generic settlement agreements violate the antitrust laws and has brought actions against some brand and generic companies, including us, that have entered into such agreements. Accordingly, we may receive formal or informal requests from the FTC for information about a particular settlement agreement, and there is a risk that the FTC, or others, such as customers, may commence an action against us alleging violations of the antitrust laws. Such settlement agreements may further expose us to claims by purchasers of the products for unlawfully inhibiting competition. We are currently defendants in private antitrust actions involving numerous settlement agreements. Similarly, the European Commission (“EU Commission”) has placed our European operations, as well as those of several brand and generic companies, under intense scrutiny in connection with its inquiry into possible anticompetitive conditions in the European pharmaceutical sector. The EU Commission has initiated proceedings against us in connection with one settlement agreement, and is investigating another agreement. Although we have argued that those agreements did not restrict competition, the EU Commission may rule against us, possibly imposing fines. It is also possible that the EU Commission would open investigations relating to subsequent 17 ----- agreements we have entered into. More generally, there is a risk that the increased scrutiny of the European pharmaceutical sector may lead to changes in the regulation of our business that would have an adverse impact on our results of operations in Europe. See “Competition Matters” in note 13 to our unaudited financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2016.",,,,,,N/A
1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.2,Risks Related to Teva,1.2.8,"Because we have substantial international operations, our sales and profits may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations and restrictions as well as credit risks.","In 2015, approximately 43% of our revenues came from sales outside the United States. As a result, we are subject to significant foreign currency risks, including repatriation restrictions in certain countries, and may face heightened risks as we enter new markets. An increasing proportion of our sales, particularly in Latin America (including Venezuela), Central and Eastern European countries and Asia, is recorded in local currencies, which exposes us to the direct risk of devaluations, hyperinflation or exchange rate fluctuations. In 2015, foreign exchange fluctuations negatively affected our revenues by approximately $1.3 billion and our operating income by $95 million. We may also be exposed to credit risks in some of these markets. The imposition of price controls or restrictions on the conversion of foreign currencies could also have a material adverse effect on our financial results. For example, our net monetary assets in Venezuela, which suffers from hyperinflation, totaled $346 million at March 31, 2016. Venezuela is a hyperinflationary economy with two official exchange rates: the DIPRO rate of 10 bolivars per U.S. dollar and the DICOM rate, which fluctuates and is currently approximately 200 bolivars per U.S. dollar. As a result of our adoption of the DIPRO rate in March 2016 (replacing a previous preferential rate), we incurred an impairment charge of $246 million on our net monetary assets in Venezuela. If there is a further devaluation of the Venezuelan currency or if our use of the preferential DIPRO rate in our financial statements can no longer be supported, we would incur an additional impairment charge and our financial results, including our operating results and cash flow, would be adversely affected. We cannot predict whether there will be a further devaluation of the Venezuelan currency or whether our use of the DIPRO rate will continue to be supported by the facts and circumstances. See “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects— Impact of Currency Fluctuations on Results of Operations.” In particular, although the majority of our net sales and operating costs is recorded in, or linked to, the U.S. dollar, our reporting currency, in 2015 we recorded sales and expenses in various other currencies. Approximately 56% of our operating costs in 2015 were incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including any fluctuations in connection with Brexit (as defined below), particularly in euros, Israeli shekels, Hungarian forints, Canadian dollars, Japanese yen and the British pound. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates between the currencies in which such costs are incurred and the U.S. dollar may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies and our financial condition. We use derivative financial instruments and “hedging” techniques to manage some of our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations in the major foreign currencies in which we operate. However, not all of our potential exposure is covered, and some elements of our consolidated financial statements, such as our equity position or operating profit, are not fully protected against foreign currency exposures. Therefore, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.",,,,,,N/A
1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.2,Risks Related to Teva,1.2.9,The vote by the United Kingdom to leave the EU could adversely affect us.,"The recent United Kingdom referendum on its membership in the EU resulted in a majority of U.K. voters voting to exit the EU (“Brexit”). As a result, we face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Any of 18 ----- these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.",,,,,,N/A
1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.2,Risks Related to Teva,1.2.10,"The success of our specialty medicines depends on the effectiveness of our patents, confidentiality agreements and other measures to protect our intellectual property rights.","The success of our specialty medicines depends substantially on our ability to obtain patents and to defend our intellectual property rights. If we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately, competitors may manufacture and market products identical or similar to ours. We have been issued numerous patents covering our specialty medicines, and have filed, and expect to continue to file, patent applications seeking to protect newly developed technologies and products in various countries, including the United States. Currently pending patent applications may not result in issued patents or be approved on a timely basis or at all. Any existing or future patents issued to or licensed by us may not provide us with any competitive advantages for our products or may be challenged or circumvented by competitors. We are currently engaged in lawsuits challenging the validity and/or enforceability of the U.S. patents covering Copaxone[®] 40 mg/mL and Amrix[®]. While we intend to defend the validity of these patents vigorously, and will seek to prevent their infringement, such efforts are expensive and time-consuming. Due to the nature of litigation, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful. Our ability to enforce our patents also depends on the laws of individual countries and each country’s practices regarding the enforcement of intellectual property rights. The loss of patent protection or regulatory exclusivity on these or other specialty medicines could materially impact our business, results of operations, financial conditions or prospects. We also rely on trade secrets, unpatented proprietary know-how, trademarks, regulatory exclusivity and continuing technological innovation that we seek to protect, in part by confidentiality agreements with licensees, suppliers, employees and consultants. If these agreements are breached, it is possible that we will not have adequate remedies.

1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.2,Risks Related to Teva,1.2.11,"Healthcare reforms, and related reductions in pharmaceutical pricing, reimbursement and coverage, by governmental authorities and third-party payors may adversely affect our business.","The continuing increase in expenditures for healthcare has been the subject of considerable government attention almost everywhere we conduct business, particularly as public resources have been stretched by financial and economic crises in the United States, Western Europe and elsewhere. Both private health insurance funds and government health authorities continue to seek ways to reduce or contain healthcare costs, including by reducing or eliminating coverage for certain products and lowering reimbursement levels. In most of the countries and regions where we operate, including the United States, Western Europe, Israel, Russia, certain countries in Central and Eastern Europe and several countries in Latin America, pharmaceutical prices are subject to new government policies designed to reduce healthcare costs. These changes frequently adversely affect pricing and profitability and may cause delays in market entry. We cannot predict which additional measures may be adopted or the impact of current and additional measures on the marketing, pricing and demand for our products. Significant developments that may adversely affect pricing in the United States include (i) the enactment of federal healthcare reform laws and regulations, including the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, and (ii) trends in the practices of managed care groups and institutional and governmental purchasers, including the impact of consolidation of our customers. Changes to the healthcare system enacted as part of healthcare reform in the United States, as well as the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, 19 ----- Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, may result in increased pricing pressure by influencing, for instance, the reimbursement policies of third-party payors. Healthcare reform legislation has increased the number of patients who have insurance coverage for our products, but provisions such as the assessment of a branded pharmaceutical manufacturer fee and an increase in the amount of rebates that manufacturers pay for coverage of their drugs by Medicaid programs may have an adverse effect on us. It is uncertain how current and future reforms in these areas will influence the future of our business operations and financial condition. In addition, “tender systems” for generic pharmaceuticals have been implemented (by both public and private entities) in a number of significant markets in which we operate, including Germany and Russia, in an effort to lower prices. Under such tender systems, manufacturers submit bids that establish prices for generic pharmaceutical products. These measures impact marketing practices and reimbursement of drugs and may further increase pressure on reimbursement margins. Certain other countries may consider the implementation of a tender system. Failing to win tenders or our withdrawal from participating in tenders, or the implementation of similar systems in other markets leading to further price declines, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.",,,,,,N/A
1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.2,Risks Related to Teva,1.2.12,"Our revenues and profits from generic pharmaceutical products typically decline as a result of competition, both from other pharmaceutical companies and as a result of increased governmental pricing pressure.","Our generic drugs face intense competition. Prices of generic drugs typically decline, often dramatically, especially as additional generic pharmaceutical companies (including low-cost generic producers based in China and India) receive approvals and enter the market for a given product and competition intensifies. Consequently, our ability to sustain our sales and profitability on any given product over time is affected by the number of new companies selling such product and the timing of their approvals. In addition, intense pressure from government healthcare authorities, particularly in highly regulated European markets, to reduce their expenditures on prescription drugs has resulted in lower pharmaceutical pricing, causing decreases in revenues and profits. Furthermore, brand pharmaceutical companies continue to defend their products vigorously. For example, brand companies often sell or license their own generic versions of their products, either directly or through other generic pharmaceutical companies (so-called “authorized generics”). No significant regulatory approvals are required for authorized generics, and brand companies do not face any other significant barriers to entry into such market. Brand companies may seek to delay introductions of generic equivalents through a variety of commercial and regulatory tactics. These actions may increase the costs and risks of our efforts to introduce generic products and may delay or prevent such introduction altogether.",,,,,,N/A

As those rules and regulations change or as interpretations of those rules and regulations evolve, our prior conduct or that of companies we have acquired may be called into question. In the United States, we are currently responding to federal investigations into our marketing practices with regard to several of our specialty pharmaceutical products, which could result in civil litigation brought on behalf of the federal government. Responding to such investigations is costly and involves a significant diversion of management’s attention. Such proceedings are unpredictable and may develop over lengthy periods of time. Future settlements may involve large cash penalties. In addition, government authorities have significant leverage to persuade pharmaceutical companies to enter into corporate integrity agreements, which can be expensive and disruptive to operations.

Although over 80% of our sales are in the United States and Europe, we expect to derive an increasing portion of our sales and future growth from other regions such as Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe and Asia, which may be more susceptible to political and economic instability. Significant portions of our operations are conducted outside the markets in which our products are sold, and accordingly we often import a substantial number of products into such markets. We may, therefore, be denied access to our customers or suppliers or denied the ability to ship products from any of our sites as a result of a closing of the borders of the countries in which we sell our products, or in which our operations are located, due to economic, legislative, political and military conditions, including hostilities and acts of terror, in such countries. Our executive offices and a substantial percentage of our manufacturing capabilities are located in Israel. Our Israeli operations are dependent upon materials imported from outside Israel. We also export significant amounts of products from Israel. Accordingly, our operations could be materially and adversely affected by acts of terrorism or if major hostilities were to occur in the Middle East or trade between Israel and its present trading partners were curtailed, including as a result of acts of terrorism in the U.S. or elsewhere.",,,,,,N/A

Many of our products are the result of complex manufacturing processes, and some require highly specialized raw materials. For some of our key raw materials, we have only a single, external source of supply, and alternate sources of supply may not be readily available. For example, we purchase raw materials for most of our oral contraceptive products, which make up a substantial portion of our women’s health business, exclusively or primarily from the same external source. If our supply of certain raw materials or finished products is interrupted from time to time, or proves insufficient to meet demand, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. Moreover, as we streamline our production capacity, particularly following the Actavis Generics acquisition, we may become more dependent on certain plants and operations for our supply. We also rely on complex shipping arrangements to and from the various facilities of our supply chain. Customs clearance and shipping by land, air or sea routes rely on and may be affected by factors that are not in our full control or are hard to predict. In addition, we rely on complex information technology systems, including Internet-based systems, to support our supply-chain processes as well as internal and external communications. The size and complexity of our systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown or interruption, whether due to computer viruses or other causes that may result in the loss of key information or the impairment of production and other supply chain processes.

1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.2,Risks Related to Teva,1.2.17,Our specialty pharmaceuticals business faces intense competition from companies that have greater resources and capabilities.,"We face intense competition in our specialty pharmaceutical business. Many of our competitors are larger and/or have substantially longer experience in the development, acquisition and marketing of branded, innovative and consumer-oriented products. They may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging market preferences or to devote greater resources to the development and marketing of new products and/or technologies than we can. As a result, any products and/or innovations that we develop may become obsolete or noncompetitive before we can recover the expenses incurred in connection with their development. In addition, for these product categories we must demonstrate to physicians, patients and third-party payors the benefits of our products relative to competing products that are often more familiar or otherwise better established. If competitors introduce new products or new variations on their existing products, our marketed products, even those protected by patents, may be replaced in the marketplace or we may be required to lower our prices. In addition, our increased focus on innovative and specialty pharmaceuticals requires much greater use of a direct sales force than does our core generic business. Our ability to realize significant revenues from direct marketing and sales activities depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified sales personnel. Competition for qualified sales personnel is intense. We may also need to enter into co-promotion, contract sales force or other such arrangements with third parties, for example, where our own direct sales force is not large enough or sufficiently well-aligned to achieve maximum penetration in the market. Any failure to attract or retain qualified sales personnel or to enter into third-party arrangements on favorable terms could prevent us from successfully maintaining current sales levels or commercializing new innovative and specialty products.",,,,,,N/A
1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.2,Risks Related to Teva,1.2.18,Sales of our products may be adversely affected by the continuing consolidation of our customer base.,"A significant portion of our sales are made to relatively few U.S. retail drug chains, wholesalers, managed care purchasing organizations, mail order distributors and hospitals. These customers are continuing to undergo significant consolidation. Net sales to one such customer in 2015 accounted for 20% of our total consolidated sales. Such consolidation has provided and may continue to provide them with additional purchasing leverage, and consequently may increase the pricing pressures that we face. Additionally, the emergence of large buying groups representing independent retail pharmacies, and the prevalence and influence of managed care organizations and similar institutions, enable those groups to extract price discounts on our products. Our net sales and quarterly growth comparisons may also be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of retail chains, major distributors and other trade buyers, whether resulting from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler buying decisions or other factors. In addition, since such a significant portion of our U.S. revenues is derived from relatively few customers, any financial difficulties experienced by a single customer, or any delay in receiving payments from a single customer, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,,,N/A
1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.2,Risks Related to Teva,1.2.19,Decreased opportunities to obtain U.S. market exclusivity for generic versions of significant products may adversely affect our revenues and profits.,"Our ability to achieve continued growth and profitability through sales of generic pharmaceuticals is dependent on our success in challenging patents, developing non-infringing products or developing products with increased complexity to provide opportunities with U.S. market exclusivity or limited competition. The failure to continue to develop such opportunities could adversely affect our sales and profitability. 22 ----- To the extent that we succeed in being the first to market a generic version of a product, and particularly if we are the only company authorized to sell during the 180-day period of exclusivity in the U.S. market, as provided under the Hatch-Waxman Act, our sales, profits and profitability can be substantially increased in the period following the introduction of such product and prior to a competitor’s introduction of an equivalent product. Even after the exclusivity period ends, there is often continuing benefit from being the first generic product in the market. However, the number of significant new generic products for which Hatch-Waxman exclusivity is available, and the size of those product opportunities, has decreased in recent years, and patent challenges have become more difficult. Additionally, increasingly we share the 180-day exclusivity period with other generic competitors, which diminishes the commercial value of the exclusivity. The 180-day market exclusivity period is triggered by commercial marketing of the generic product or, in certain cases, can be triggered by a final court decision that is no longer subject to appeal holding the applicable patents to be invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. However, the exclusivity period can be forfeited by our failure to obtain tentative approval of our product within a specified statutory period or to launch a product following such a court decision. The Hatch-Waxman Act also contains other forfeiture provisions that may deprive the first “Paragraph IV” filer of exclusivity if certain conditions are met, some of which may be outside our control. Accordingly, we may face the risk that our exclusivity period is triggered or forfeited before we are able to commercialize a product and therefore may not be able to exploit a given exclusivity period for specific products.",,,,,,N/A
1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.2,Risks Related to Teva,1.2.20,"We have sold and may in the future elect to sell generic products prior to the final resolution of outstanding patent litigation, and, as a result, we could be subject to liability for damages in the U.S., Europe and other markets where we do business.","Our ability to introduce new products depends in large part upon the success of our challenges to patent rights held by third parties or our ability to develop non-infringing products. Based upon a variety of legal and commercial factors, we may elect to sell a generic product even though patent litigation is still pending, either before any court decision is rendered or while an appeal of a lower court decision is pending. The outcome of such patent litigation could, in certain cases, materially adversely affect our business. For example, we launched a generic version of Protonix[®] (pantoprazole), despite pending litigation with the company that sells the brand versions, which we eventually settled for $1.6 billion. If we sell products prior to a final court decision, whether in the United States, Europe or elsewhere, and such decision is adverse to us, we could be required to cease selling the infringing products, causing us to lose future sales revenue from such products and to face substantial liabilities for patent infringement, in the form of either payment for the innovator’s lost profits or a royalty on our sales of the infringing products. These damages may be significant, and could materially adversely affect our business. In the United States, in the event of a finding of willful infringement, the damages assessed may be up to three times the profits lost by the patent owner. Because of the discount pricing typically involved with generic pharmaceutical products, patented brand products generally realize a significantly higher profit margin than generic pharmaceutical products. As a result, the damages assessed may be significantly more than our profits. In addition, even if we do not suffer damages, we may incur significant legal and related expenses in the course of successfully defending against infringement claims.",,,,,,N/A
1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.2,Risks Related to Teva,1.2.21,We may be susceptible to significant product liability claims that are not covered by insurance.,"Our business inherently exposes us to claims for injuries allegedly resulting from the use of our products. As our portfolio of available products expands, particularly with new specialty products, we may experience increases in product liability claims asserted against us. The potential for product liability claims may increase further upon the implementation of proposed regulations in the U.S. that would permit companies to change the labeling of their generic products. 23 ----- With respect to product liability exposure for products we sell outside of the United States, we have limited insurance coverage, which is subject to varying levels of deductibles and/or self-insured retentions. For product liability exposure in the United States, although in the past we have had limited coverage, with very high deductibles and/or self-insured retentions, we are no longer buying coverage for product liability claims arising in the United States. Product liability coverage for pharmaceutical companies, including us, is increasingly expensive and difficult to obtain on reasonable terms.

In addition, the success of our research and development activities depends on our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of skilled scientific personnel. Any loss of service of key members of our organization, or any diminution in our ability to continue to attract high-quality employees, may delay or prevent the achievement of major business objectives.

Some of the applicable laws may impose liability even in the absence of specific intent to defraud. The subjective decisions and complex methodologies used in making calculations under these programs are subject to review and challenge, and it is possible that such reviews could result in material changes. A number of state attorneys general and others have filed lawsuits alleging that we and other pharmaceutical companies reported inflated average wholesale prices, leading to excessive payments by Medicare and/or Medicaid for prescription drugs. Such allegations could, if proven or settled, result in additional monetary penalties (beyond the lawsuits we have already settled) and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other programs. In addition, we are notified from time to time of governmental investigations regarding drug reimbursement or pricing issues.

Goodwill and acquired indefinite life intangible assets are subject to impairment review on an annual basis and whenever potential impairment indicators are present. Other longlived assets are reviewed when there is an indication that impairment may have occurred. The amount of goodwill, identifiable intangible assets and property, plant and equipment on our consolidated balance sheet has increased approximately 31% in the past five years to $33.2 billion mainly as a result of our acquisitions, and is expected to significantly increase further following consummation of the Actavis Generics and other future acquisitions. For example, in 2015 we recorded impairment charges on long-lived assets of $361 million. Changes in market conditions or other changes in the future outlook of value may lead to further impairment charges in the future. In addition, we may from time to time sell assets that we determine are not critical to our strategy or execution. Future events or decisions may lead to asset impairments and/or related charges.

1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.2,Risks Related to Teva,1.2.25,Our tax liabilities could be larger than anticipated.,"We are subject to tax in many jurisdictions, and significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. Likewise, we are subject to audit by tax authorities in many jurisdictions. In such audits, our interpretation of tax legislation may be challenged and tax authorities in various jurisdictions may disagree with, and subsequently challenge, the amount of profits taxed in such jurisdictions under our intercompany agreements. For example, in 2013, we paid the Israeli tax authorities approximately $790 million in additional income taxes, applying the provisions of Amendment 69 to the Israeli Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959 to certain previously tax-exempt profits, as well as to settle tax assessments for the years 2005 to 2007. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcome of such audits and related litigation could be different from our provision for taxes and may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. The base erosion and profit shifting (“BEPS”) project undertaken by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) may have adverse consequences to our tax liabilities. The BEPS project contemplates changes to numerous international tax principles, as well as national tax incentives, and these changes, if adopted by individual countries, could adversely affect our provision for income taxes. It is hard to predict how the principles and recommendations developed by the OECD in the BEPS project will translate into specific national laws, and therefore we cannot predict at this stage the magnitude of the effect of such rules on our financial results.",,,,,,N/A

As indebtedness of Teva, the guarantees will be our general, unsecured obligations and will rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsubordinated, unsecured indebtedness. The guarantees will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured indebtedness we may have up to the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness and structurally subordinated to any existing and future liabilities and other indebtedness of our subsidiaries with respect to the assets of those subsidiaries. These liabilities may include debt securities, credit facilities, trade payables, guarantees, lease obligations, letter of credit obligations and other indebtedness. See “Description of the Notes and the Guarantees—Description of the Guarantees.” The indenture governing the notes does not restrict us or our subsidiaries from incurring debt in the future, nor does the indenture limit the amount of indebtedness we can issue that is equal in right of payment. At March 31, 2016, we had no secured indebtedness outstanding, and our subsidiaries, other than finance subsidiaries, had approximately $10.2 billion of indebtedness outstanding.",,,,,,N/A
1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.4,Risks Related to the Notes,1.4.8,We may be subject to restrictions on receiving dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries.,"Our income is derived in large part from our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our ability to pay our obligations under the guarantees depends in part on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment of those earnings to us, whether in the form of dividends, loans or advances.

1,1,RISK FACTORS,1.4,Risks Related to the Notes,1.4.9,We cannot assure you that the procedures for book-entry interests to be implemented through Euroclear or Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of your rights under the notes.,"Unless and until notes in definitive registered form are issued in exchange for global notes, owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of the notes except in the limited circumstances provided in the indenture governing the notes. The common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream (or its nominee) will be the sole registered holder of the global notes representing the notes. After payment to the common depositary, we will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and if you are not a participant in Euroclear or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder under the indenture. Unlike the holders of the notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any request actions on a timely basis. Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear or Clearstream. We cannot assure you that the procedures to be implemented through Euroclear or Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the notes.",,,,,,N/A

It is therefore possible that notes may be traded in amounts that would cause a holder of notes to hold a principal amount of less than €100,000 following such trade. In such a case, a holder of notes who holds a principal 29 ----- amount of less than €100,000 may not receive a definitive certificate in respect of such holding (should definitive certificates be printed) and would need to purchase a principal amount of notes such that its holding amounts to at least €100,000.",,,,,,N/A

In addition, the ongoing situation relating to the sovereign debt of several European countries, in particular in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, together with the risk of financial contagion to other more financially stable countries, has raised a number of concerns and uncertainties regarding the stability and overall standing of the European Monetary Union.
