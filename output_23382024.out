    Question:
    Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Text:
    Title: Our business is significantly dependent on our ability to generate rental income. Our rental income and funds from operations could particularly be negatively affected by a potential increase in vacancy rates.
    Text: We rely significantly on rental income. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, 84.7% of our revenue was derived from rental activities (including facility services), and our funds from operations (from rental activities) (“FFO 1”) amounted to €44,311 thousand (compared to 89.5% and €33,430 thousand in the six-month period ended June 30, 2019, respectively). Our rental income is impacted predominantly by the size of our portfolio, which consisted of 74,682 units (excluding parking spaces and other units) (with a total lettable area of 4,709,519 sqm) of which 72,380 were residential units (with a total lettable area of 4,440,581 sqm), as well as rent levels, which amounted to €6.20 per sqm on average (excluding parking spaces and other units) (all figures as of June 30, 2020). As a result, our performance depends largely on the amount of rental income generated, which in turn is significantly dependent on the vacancy levels of our portfolio. As of June 30, 2020, the average vacancy level of our residential portfolio (in % per sqm) was at 5.5% (or 243,859 sqm) and of our commercial portfolio at 7.8% (or 20,919 sqm), after 2.9% (or 42,771 sqm) and 4.8% (or 8,210 sqm), respectively, as of June 30, 2019. The vacancy levels within our portfolio could increase, particularly in lower-value residential units, in less attractive locations, in areas with weak infrastructure or in properties where investments do not result in increased rents in line with expected market rents or increased occupancy levels. Our strategy also focuses on the renovation and refurbishment of selected parts of our portfolio with the highest vacancy levels. If these measures do not result in a significant reduction in vacancy levels for these properties after completion of the renovation and refurbishment work, this could have an adverse effect on our financial results relative to our business plan. In addition to lost rental income, additional fixed and ancillary costs incurred for the maintenance of vacant residential units could reduce our operating profit. Furthermore, a longer period of high vacancy levels could generally lead to lower levels of income from rental activities and make it more difficult to increase average rental levels. As our income from rental activities (including facility services) represents 84.7% of the revenue generated in the six-month period ended June 30, 2020 (compared to 89.5% in the six-month period ended June 30, 2019), our ability to reduce vacancy levels or increase rents will significantly contribute to future growth of our revenue. -----

    Question:
    Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Text:
    Title: Our ability to operate our business successfully relies on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and circumstances that may be unfavorable, in part or as a whole, in particular due to unexpected liabilities, an incomplete or inaccurate assessment of a market, value determinations and due diligence findings and challenges with respect to achieving anticipated synergies and insufficient investment horizons.
    Text: We face the risk that we may not be able to generate returns or generate significantly lower returns in the future. In particular, our projections of the future demand for apartments suitable for modernization may turn out to be inaccurate or inappropriate to achieve a positive return. Also, tenant preferences may change. Further, we may not be in a position to find sufficient investment opportunities to achieve further growth. In addition, we may not be able to pass on the costs for these modernization measures to our tenants due to legal constraints or if the tenants would be unable to afford rent increases as a result of these modernization measures. Tenants may also cause postponements to our modernization measures by, for example, refusing to vacate the units for modernization work to take place. Further, we may be restricted in our ability to finance the investment program through loans or other debt instruments depending on our current and future debt level and structure. The success of our business model depends in part on our ability to increase rent levels through modernizing our existing real estate portfolio and real estate properties that we acquire as well as our ability to estimate and control the costs of such modernizations. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2020, we incurred maintenance and capital expenditures of €11.5 per sqm (compared to €18.4 per sqm in the six-month period ended June 30, 2019), whereas our average like-for-like rental growth of the residential portfolio during the sixmonth period ended June 30, 2020 amounted to 1.9%. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, maintenance and capital expenditures amounted to €36.2 per sqm (compared to €39.2 per sqm in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018) and average like-for-like rental growth of the residential portfolio amounted to 5% for the same period. We plan to continue investing a significant amount into modernization measures, particularly in residential markets that provide for significant rent upside for refurbished apartments. Due to the current Berlin rent freeze (Mietendeckel), this is not the case for our property portfolio located in Berlin. There is no assurance that the targeted rent upside can be realized. Even if the existing real estate portfolio and the real estate properties that we may acquire can be repositioned, modernized and refurbished, such measures could prove to be unsuccessful or ineffective and not result in targeted rent levels. Further, our assumptions in relation to achievable rental levels, rental increases, vacancy rates, modernization costs, personnel (including in-house facility management personnel), overhead expenses, maintenance and capital expenditures may prove to be partially or entirely inaccurate. Furthermore, unforeseen issues or risks could materialize that could result in substantially increased maintenance and capital expenditures, in particular, due to changes in applicable laws and regulations; or we may be unable to resolve such issues or risks at all or not in an economically reasonable manner. Regarding environmental matters relevant to modernizations and refurbishments, see “—Regulatory _and Legal Risks—Our business is subject to the general legal environment in Germany. Any disadvantageous changes in the legal environment, such as mandatory environmental modernization provisions, restrictions regarding modernization measures or provisions (including taxes) that result in the incurrence of costs in the event of a property sale, or disadvantageous changes to the Berlin Mietspiegel regulation, may be detrimental to us.” and “We may incur environmental liabilities, for example, from residual pollution including wartime ordinance, soil conditions, asbestos and contaminants in building materials, as well as from possible building code violations.”._ In the event that a building is subject to historic preservation laws, compliance with the respective historic preservation requirements could significantly delay the refurbishment or modernization process and could result in significantly higher expenses for the particular project. Consequently, we may be unable to perform our obligations to a tenant, which could result in rent to be deferred or not due at all. In addition, legal requirements relating to our properties could become more stringent or onerous, particularly with respect to construction and environmental requirements; similarly, requirements might be imposed to increase the availability of handicapped-accessible and adapted housing. The realization of any of these risks could have a negative effect on our ability to successfully conduct our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. -----

    Question:
    Does the text mention that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?

    Text:
    Title: We rely on our ability to identify potential real estate portfolio acquisition opportunities in order to implement our investment strategies. We may not be able to identify all risks associated with any such acquisitions. Assumptions could prove to be insufficient or incorrect and a successful integration of acquisitions may not be achievable.
    Text: As part of our strategy, we evaluate real estate portfolios in order to identify those that might complement our existing portfolio and our current management platform. Between January 1, 2017 and June 30, 2020, we have acquired 4,650 residential real estate units with a total residential area of 322 thousand sqm. In addition, through the completion of the takeover offer for ADLER Real Estate Aktiengesellschaft (“ADLER Real Estate” and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “ADLER Real Estate Group”), we acquired an additional 58,007 residential real estate units with a total residential area of 3,494,017 sqm. The units we have acquired or will acquire may generate less than the originally calculated rental income or operating profit due to inaccurate projections and assumptions or for other reasons. Although we have attempted and will continue to attempt to address the relevant issues, including for example tax, legal and operational management issues, arising from acquisitions, we may not have addressed and in the future may not address all relevant issues related thereto and to the successful integration of the acquired portfolios. In particular, the integration risks associated with acquisitions of large portfolios are high due to their significant size. The integration of any future portfolio acquisitions may not be successful or may be more difficult than expected due to legal and contractual restrictions and obligations. In addition, we may be unable to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated synergies, economies of scale and cost-savings. We may become subject to contractual obligations under acquisition agreements pursuant to which we acquired our real estate portfolio, which limit our ability to fully integrate acquisitions on a legal and operational basis that may result in delays and unforeseen costs. Moreover, laws governing pensions, labor unions and works councils may also limit our ability to integrate acquisitions and especially to move employees from one legal entity to another. To the extent that we are not able to successfully integrate our current portfolio and any potential future portfolio acquisitions, we may be prevented from increasing revenues or reducing costs by achieving economies of scale in the manner that we anticipate. Any such failure could cause reduced levels of rental income and operating profit. Furthermore, investments in properties involve considerable risks. We are not always able to obtain from the seller the records and documents that we need in order to fully verify that the buildings we acquire were constructed in accordance, and that their use complies, with applicable planning laws and building code regulations. We may only be able to conduct limited due diligence on, or the due diligence conducted may not accurately reveal the risks associated with, the properties or entities we plan to acquire. Accordingly, we may not be in a position to examine whether the original owners of the properties, and/or the properties themselves, have obtained all required permits for new buildings, satisfied all permit conditions, received all necessary licenses and fire, health and safety certificates, or satisfied all comparable requirements. In addition, the properties may suffer from hidden defects, such as contamination, and may thus require significant modernization investments. For example, while performing due diligence, we may not have discovered, or the seller may not have disclosed, that the properties that we have acquired have underground oil tanks underneath them or contain certain types of fungus which may weaken the structural foundations of our acquired properties. In addition, we may not have been able or may be unable to undertake (or obtain results for) all searches (including title and collateral searches), inspections and surveys (including intrusive environmental and asbestos investigations and technical surveys) that we might otherwise carry out in relation to comparable acquisitions. Accordingly, in the course of the acquisition of residential and other property portfolios, specific risks may not be, or might not have been, recognized or evaluated correctly. Thus, legal and/or economic liabilities may be, or might have been, overlooked or misjudged. These circumstances could lead to additional costs and could have an adverse effect on our proceeds from sales and rental income of the relevant properties. The assumptions we rely on when acquiring real estate, particularly with respect to anticipated rents, achievability of vacancy reduction, maintenance expenses, integration costs and expected proceeds from condominium sales, could turn out to be incorrect. Although sellers typically make various warranties in purchase agreements that we enter into in connection with property acquisitions, it is possible that these warranties do not cover all risks or that they fail to cover such risks sufficiently. Additionally, a warranty made by a seller may be unenforceable due to the seller’s insolvency or for other reasons. In some cases, a real estate seller makes no representation or warranty as to the sufficiency and correctness of the information that is made available in the context of a due diligence investigation, or as to whether such information remains correct during the period between the conclusion of the due diligence and the closing of the relevant acquisition. Accordingly, such risks can arise despite a thorough due diligence. ----- It could also subsequently become more difficult to let or sell certain properties; market rents could develop unfavorably; and/or vacancy rates could increase. In addition, the various factors that affect market rents make it difficult to project future rental income, so that the rental income in relation to an acquired property can develop differently than projected. Our current portfolios, or portfolios that may be acquired in the future, may not develop as expected. For example, targeted rent increases may not be implemented as planned due to a lack of tenants who are willing or able to pay increased rents, a negative development of the location or property or increased vacancy rates, for example due to unfavorable demographic or economic developments. Any inability on our part to identify and assess all risks in connection with acquisitions as well as insufficient or inaccurate assumptions could hinder or render impossible a successful integration of acquisitions, as a result of which we may incur higher costs, lower rental income or divergent value developments, which in turn could lead to material adverse effects on our business, net assets, financial position and results of operations as well as our prospects.

    Text:
    Title: Our business is dependent on regional real estate markets and their liquidity, particularly Berlin, which may be subject to adverse market developments. Fluctuation in the development of the currently high demand and prices could make it difficult for us to conduct our business activities and to implement our strategy to capture additional growth opportunities.
    Text: As of June 30, 2020, our real estate portfolio comprised 74,682 units (excluding parking spaces and other units) units, of which 72,380 were residential units, with a portfolio value of €8.9 billion. Prior to the completion of the takeover offer for ADLER Real Estate, all of the real estate that ADLER Group S.A. (formerly ADO Properties S.A.) directly and indirectly owned was located in Berlin, and Berlin continues to represent a significant part of our portfolio. Accordingly, we are extensively dependent on trends in the Berlin residential real estate market, as well as general economic conditions and developments in Berlin. Our performance and the valuation of our properties are dependent on various factors including demographic and cyclicality trends in Berlin, purchasing power of the population, the development of the population, attractiveness of the particular locations of our properties, the unemployment rate and employment offers, infrastructure, social structure, and supply and demand for real estate space and assets in the respective locations and markets in Berlin. As of June 30, 2020, 25.6% of the total number of residential units owned by the ADLER Group are located in Berlin. This could create a disadvantage compared to competitors who have a more geographically diversified real estate portfolio. In particular, the demand for residential real estate is subject to rapid and occasionally unpredictable changes, including as a result of changes to economic conditions, interest rates and business confidence. The effects of any decline in the attractiveness of the Berlin real estate market and of any downturn or illiquidity in the Berlin real estate market could significantly harm our business. In addition, regional economic and political developments, and other trends in the Berlin market, have a significant impact on the demand for our residential real estate and the rents achievable, as well as on the valuation of our properties. Such local developments may differ considerably from overall developments in Germany. For example, the purchasing power of residents of eastern German states lagged behind the purchasing power of the residents of western German states in 2018 and 2019 (source: GfK—Purchasing Power Germany). While some cities and regions in eastern Germany have seen decreasing unemployment rates and growing purchasing power in recent years, there is no guarantee that this trend will continue. Furthermore, we are also affected by the German economic conditions as a whole, such as growth in gross domestic product (“GDP”), unemployment, interest rates, inflation and financing availability.

In some cases, a real estate seller makes no representation or warranty as to the sufficiency and correctness of the information that is made available in the context of a due diligence investigation, or as to whether such information remains correct during the period between the conclusion of the due diligence and the closing of the relevant acquisition. Accordingly, such risks can arise despite a thorough due diligence. ----- It could also subsequently become more difficult to let or sell certain properties; market rents could develop unfavorably; and/or vacancy rates could increase. In addition, the various factors that affect market rents make it difficult to project future rental income, so that the rental income in relation to an acquired property can develop differently than projected. Our current portfolios, or portfolios that may be acquired in the future, may not develop as expected. For example, targeted rent increases may not be implemented as planned due to a lack of tenants who are willing or able to pay increased rents, a negative development of the location or property or increased vacancy rates, for example due to unfavorable demographic or economic developments. Any inability on our part to identify and assess all risks in connection with acquisitions as well as insufficient or inaccurate assumptions could hinder or render impossible a successful integration of acquisitions, as a result of which we may incur higher costs, lower rental income or divergent value developments, which in turn could lead to material adverse effects on our business, net assets, financial position and results of operations as well as our prospects.

    Text:
    Title: Our business is dependent on regional real estate markets and their liquidity, particularly Berlin, which may be subject to adverse market developments. Fluctuation in the development of the currently high demand and prices could make it difficult for us to conduct our business activities and to implement our strategy to capture additional growth opportunities.
    Text: As of June 30, 2020, our real estate portfolio comprised 74,682 units (excluding parking spaces and other units) units, of which 72,380 were residential units, with a portfolio value of €8.9 billion. Prior to the completion of the takeover offer for ADLER Real Estate, all of the real estate that ADLER Group S.A. (formerly ADO Properties S.A.) directly and indirectly owned was located in Berlin, and Berlin continues to represent a significant part of our portfolio. Accordingly, we are extensively dependent on trends in the Berlin residential real estate market, as well as general economic conditions and developments in Berlin. Our performance and the valuation of our properties are dependent on various factors including demographic and cyclicality trends in Berlin, purchasing power of the population, the development of the population, attractiveness of the particular locations of our properties, the unemployment rate and employment offers, infrastructure, social structure, and supply and demand for real estate space and assets in the respective locations and markets in Berlin. As of June 30, 2020, 25.6% of the total number of residential units owned by the ADLER Group are located in Berlin. This could create a disadvantage compared to competitors who have a more geographically diversified real estate portfolio. In particular, the demand for residential real estate is subject to rapid and occasionally unpredictable changes, including as a result of changes to economic conditions, interest rates and business confidence. The effects of any decline in the attractiveness of the Berlin real estate market and of any downturn or illiquidity in the Berlin real estate market could significantly harm our business. In addition, regional economic and political developments, and other trends in the Berlin market, have a significant impact on the demand for our residential real estate and the rents achievable, as well as on the valuation of our properties. Such local developments may differ considerably from overall developments in Germany. For example, the purchasing power of residents of eastern German states lagged behind the purchasing power of the residents of western German states in 2018 and 2019 (source: GfK—Purchasing Power Germany). While some cities and regions in eastern Germany have seen decreasing unemployment rates and growing purchasing power in recent years, there is no guarantee that this trend will continue. Furthermore, we are also affected by the German economic conditions as a whole, such as growth in gross domestic product (“GDP”), unemployment, interest rates, inflation and financing availability.
