This base prospectus (the “Base Prospectus”) has been approved by the Central Bank of Ireland (the “Central **Bank”), as**
competent authority under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 (the
“Prospectus Regulation”). In compliance with Article 8 of the Prospectus Regulation, this Base Prospectus has been
approved for the purpose of giving information with regard to the issue of notes (“Notes”) by Cellnex Finance Company,
S.A.U. (the “Issuer” or “Cellnex Finance”) under the Guaranteed Euro Medium Term Note Programme (the
“Programme”) described in this Base Prospectus. The payment of all amounts due in respect of the Notes will be
unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Cellnex Telecom, S.A. (the “Guarantor” or “Cellnex”). The obligations
of the Guarantor in that respect (the “Guarantee”) are contained in the deed of guarantee dated 3 August 2021. This Base
Prospectus has been prepared in accordance with, and including the information required by, Annexes 7, 15 and 21 of the
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/980 of 14 March 2019 supplementing the Prospectus Regulation.

The Central Bank only approves this Base Prospectus as meeting the requirements of completeness, comprehensibility and
consistency imposed by the Prospectus Regulation. Such an approval should not be considered as an endorsement of either
the Issuer or the Guarantor that are the subject of this Base Prospectus nor as an endorsement of the quality of any Notes
that are the subject of the Base Prospectus. Investors should make their own assessment as to the suitability of investing in
such Notes. Such approval relates only to the issue of Notes under the Programme during the period of 12 months after the
date hereof which are to be admitted to trading on a regulated market for the purposes of Directive 2014/65/EU on markets
in financial instruments (“MiFID II”, as amended) and/or which are to be offered to the public in any Member State of the
European Economic Area (the “EEA”).

Application has been made to Euronext Dublin (as defined below) for the Notes issued under the Programme described in
this Base Prospectus to be admitted to the official list (the “Official **List”) and trading on its regulated market.**

The Programme also permits Notes to be issued on the basis that they will be admitted to listing, trading and/or quotation
by such other or further competent authorities, stock exchanges and/or quotation systems as may be agreed with the Issuer
and the Guarantor.

References in the Base Prospectus to “Euronext Dublin” (and all related references) shall mean the regulated market of the
Irish Stock Exchange plc, doing business as Euronext Dublin. In addition, references in the Base Prospectus to the Notes
being “listed” (and all related references) shall mean that such Notes have been admitted to listing on the Official List of
Euronext Dublin and admitted to trading on its regulated market or, as the case may be, a MiFID II regulated market. The
regulated market of Euronext Dublin is a regulated market for the purposes of MiFID II. This document may be used to
list Notes on the regulated market of Euronext Dublin pursuant to the Programme. The Programme provides for Notes to


-----

be listed on such other or further stock exchange(s) as may be agreed between the relevant Issuer, the Guarantor and the
relevant Dealer(s) (as defined below). The maximum aggregate nominal amount of all Notes from time to time outstanding
under the Programme will not exceed €15,000,000,000 (or its equivalent in other currencies, subject to increase as provided
herein). The Notes will be issued in such denominations as may be agreed between the Issuer, the Guarantor and the
relevant Dealer(s) and as specified in the applicable Final Terms, save that the minimum denomination of each Note will
be such amount as may be allowed or required from time to time by the relevant central bank (or equivalent body) or any
laws or regulations applicable to the relevant specified currency indicated in the applicable Final Terms (as defined below),
and save that the minimum denomination of each Note admitted to trading on a regulated market situated or operating
within the EEA and/or offered to the public in an EEA state in circumstances which require the publication of a prospectus
under the Prospectus Regulation will be €100,000 (or, if the Notes are denominated in a currency other than euro, the
equivalent amount in such currency).

Notice of the aggregate nominal amount of Notes, interest payable in respect of Notes and the issue price of Notes will be
set out in the Final Terms (as defined herein) which will also complete information set out in the terms and conditions
applicable to each Tranche (as defined under “Terms and Conditions of the Notes”), as required. With respect to Notes to
be listed on Euronext Dublin, the Final Terms will be delivered to the Central Bank on or before the date of issue of the
Notes of such Tranche. Copies of the Final Terms relating to Notes which are listed on Euronext Dublin or offered in
circumstances which require a prospectus to be published under the Prospectus Regulation will be available for viewing
on the website of Euronext Dublin (https://live.euronext.com) and free of charge, at the registered office of the Issuer, the
registered office of the Guarantor and at the specified office of each of the Paying Agents (as defined under “Terms and
_Conditions of the Notes”)._

Investing in Notes issued under the Programme involves certain risks. The principal risk factors that may affect the abilities
of the Issuer and the Guarantor to fulfil its obligations under the Notes are discussed under “Risk Factors” below.

The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) or with
any securities regulatory authority of any state or other jurisdiction of the United States (the “U.S.”), and Notes in bearer
form are subject to U.S. tax law requirements. The Notes may not be offered, sold or (in the case of Notes in bearer form)
delivered within the U.S. or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities
Act (“Regulation S”)) except in certain transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

**MiFID II product governance / target market – The Final Terms in respect of any Notes will include a legend entitled**
“MiFID II Product Governance” which will outline the target market assessment in respect of the Notes and which channels
for distribution of the Notes are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a
“distributor”) should take into consideration the target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the
target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

A determination will be made in relation to each issue about whether, for the purpose of the MiFID Product Governance
rules under EU Delegated Directive 2017/593 (the “MiFID Product Governance Rules”), any Dealer subscribing for any
Notes is a manufacturer in respect of such Notes, but otherwise neither the Arranger (as defined in “Overview”) nor the
Dealers nor any of their respective affiliates will be a manufacturer for the purpose of the MIFID Product Governance
Rules.

**PRIIPs / IMPORTANT – EEA RETAIL INVESTORS – The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise**
made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these
purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1)
of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article
2 of the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014
(as amended the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail
investors in the EEA will be prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to
any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.


-----

**UK MiFIR product governance / target market – The Final Terms in respect of any Notes will include a legend entitled**
“UK MiFIR Product Governance” which will outline the target market assessment in respect of the Notes and which
channels for distribution of the Notes are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the
Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the
FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance
**Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or**
refining the target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

A determination will be made in relation to each issue about whether, for the purpose of the UK MiFIR Product Governance
Rules, any Dealer subscribing for any Notes is a manufacturer in respect of such Notes, but otherwise neither the Arranger
nor the Dealers nor any of their respective affiliates will be a manufacturer for the purpose of the UK MIFIR Product
Governance Rules.

**IMPORTANT – UK RETAIL INVESTORS – The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available**
to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (“UK”). For
these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article
2 of Regulation (EU) No. 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law of the UK by virtue of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU)
2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation
(EU) No. 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law of the UK by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as
defined in Article 2 of the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of domestic law of the UK by virtue of the EUWA.
Consequently no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of domestic law of the UK
by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

Amounts payable on Floating Rate Notes may be calculated by reference to one of the Euro Interbank Offered Rate
(“EURIBOR”), the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or the Sterling Overnight Index Average (“SONIA”) rate
as specified in the relevant Final Terms, which are provided by the European Money Markets Institutes (“EMMI”), ICE
Benchmark Administration Limited (“ICE”) and the Bank of England, respectively. As of the date of the Base Prospectus,
EMMI is included in the register of administrators and benchmarks established and maintained by the European Securities
and Markets Authorities (“ESMA”) pursuant to Article 36 of the Regulation (EU) No. 2016/1011 (the “Benchmark
**Regulation”). ICE and the Bank of England are not included in ESMA’s register of administrators and benchmarks**
pursuant to Article 36 of the Benchmark Regulation. The transitional provisions in Article 51 of the Benchmark Regulation
apply, such that the ICE is not currently required to obtain recognition, endorsement or equivalence. As far as the Issuer is
aware, the Bank of England, as administrator of SONIA is not required to be registered by virtue of Article 2 of the
Benchmark Regulation.

### Restrictions on distribution

The distribution of this Base Prospectus and any Final Terms or Drawdown Prospectus, as the case may be, and
the offering, sale and delivery of the Notes in certain jurisdictions may be restricted by law. Persons into whose
possession this Base Prospectus or any Final Terms or Drawdown Prospectus, as the case may be, comes are
required by the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Dealers to inform themselves about and to observe any such
restrictions. For a description of certain restrictions on offers, sales and deliveries of Notes and on the distribution
of this Base Prospectus or any Final Terms or Drawdown Prospectus, as the case may be, and other offering
material relating to the Notes, see “Subscription and Sale”.

In particular, the Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or with any securities
regulatory authority of any state or other jurisdiction of the U.S., and Notes in bearer form are subject to U.S. tax
law requirements. The Notes may not be offered, sold or (in the case of Notes in bearer form) delivered within
the U.S. or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S) except in certain
transactions exempt from the registration requirements in the Securities Act.

Terms or Drawdown Prospectus, as the case may be, should subscribe for or purchase any Notes. Each recipient
of this Base Prospectus or any Final Terms or Drawdown Prospectus, as the case may be, shall be taken to have
made its own investigation and appraisal of the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Issuer and the Guarantor.

Dealer Agreement as defined under “Subscription and Sale”.

### Certain definitions

In this Base Prospectus, unless otherwise specified, references to a “Member State” are references to a Member
State of the EEA, references to “U.S. $”, “U.S. dollars” or “dollars” are to United States dollars, and references
to “€”, “EUR” or “euro” are to the currency introduced at the start of the third stage of European economic and

introduction of the euro, as amended.

### Rounding

Certain figures included in this Base Prospectus have been subject to rounding adjustments; accordingly, figures
shown for the same category presented in different tables may vary slightly and figures shown as totals in certain
tables may not be an arithmetic aggregation of the figures which precede them.

### Ratings

Tranches of Notes issued under the Programme will be rated or unrated. Where a Tranche of Notes is rated, such
rating will not necessarily be the same as the rating(s) assigned to Notes already issued. Where a Tranche of

A44408936

## ii


-----

Notes is rated, the applicable rating(s) will be specified in the relevant Final Terms. Whether or not each credit
rating applied for in relation to a relevant Tranche of Notes will be (1) issued by a credit rating agency established
in the EEA and registered (or which has applied for registration and not been refused) under the Regulation (EU)
No. 1060/2009, as amended (the “CRA Regulation”), or (2) issued by a credit rating agency which is not
established in the EEA but will be endorsed by a credit rating agency which is established in the EEA and
registered under the CRA Regulation or (3) issued by a credit rating agency which is not established in the EEA
but which is certified under the CRA Regulation, will be disclosed in the Final Terms. In general, European
regulated investors are restricted from using a rating for regulatory purposes if such rating is not issued by a credit
rating agency established in the EEA and registered under the CRA Regulation unless (1) the rating is provided
by a credit rating agency not established in the EEA but is endorsed by a credit rating agency established in the
EEA and registered under the CRA Regulation or (2) the rating is provided by a credit rating agency not
established in the EEA which is certified under the CRA Regulation.

### Language

The language of the Base Prospectus is English. Certain legislative references and technical terms have been
cited in their original language in order that the correct technical meaning may be ascribed to them under
applicable law.

### Stabilisation

In connection with the issue of any Tranche of Notes, the Dealer or Dealers (if any) named as the Stabilisation
Manager(s) (or persons acting on behalf of any Stabilisation Manager(s)) in the applicable Final Terms may over
allot Notes or effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the Notes at a level higher than
that which might otherwise prevail. However, stabilisation may not necessarily occur. Any stabilisation action
may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offer of the relevant
Tranche of Notes is made and, if begun, may cease at any time, but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days
after the issue date of the relevant Tranche of Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the relevant
Tranche of Notes. Any stabilisation action or over-allotment must be conducted by the relevant Stabilisation
Manager(s) (or person(s) acting on behalf of any Stabilisation Manager(s)) in accordance with all applicable laws
and rules.

### FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Base Prospectus includes forward-looking statements that reflect the Group’s intentions, beliefs or current
expectations and projections about their future results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, performance,
prospects, anticipated growth, strategies, plans, opportunities, trends and the market in which the Group operates.
The Issuer and the Guarantor have tried to identify these and other forward-looking statements by using the words
“may”, “could”, “will”, “would”, “should”, “expect”, “intend”, “estimate”, “anticipate”, “guidance”, “project”,
“future”, “potential”, “believe”, “seek”, “plan”, “aim”, “expect”, “objective”, “goal”, “project”, “strategy”,
“target”, “continue” and similar expressions or their negatives. These forward-looking statements are based on
numerous assumptions regarding the Group’s present and future business and the environment in which the Group
expects to operate in the future. Forward-looking statements may be found in the sections of this Base Prospectus
entitled “Risk Factors”, “Description of the Issuer” and “Description of the Guarantor” and elsewhere in this
Base Prospectus.

These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions and
other factors that could cause the Group’s actual business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity,
performance, prospects, anticipated growth, strategies, plans or opportunities, as well as those of the markets the
Group serves or intends to serve, to differ materially from those expressed in, or suggested by, these forwardlooking statements. Investors should read the section entitled “Risk Factors” (including the information referred
to in such section) and the section entitled “Business” for a more complete discussion of the factors that could
affect the Group.

In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events described in this Base
Prospectus may not occur. Additional risks that the Issuer and the Guarantor may currently deem immaterial or
that are not presently known to the Issuer and the Guarantor could also cause the forward-looking events
discussed in this Base Prospectus not to occur. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on
which they are made. Except as otherwise required by applicable securities law and regulations and by any
applicable stock exchange regulations, the Issuer and the Guarantor undertake no obligation to update publicly
or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed
circumstances or any other reason after the date of this Base Prospectus. Given the uncertainty inherent in
forward-looking statements, the Issuer and the Guarantor caution prospective investors not to place undue
reliance on these statements.

The Dealers assume no responsibility or liability for, and make no representation, warranty or assurance
whatsoever in respect of, any of the forward-looking statements contained in this Base Prospectus.

**Initial Programme Amount** Up to €15,000,000,000 (or its equivalent in other currencies)
aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding at any one time.
The maximum aggregate principal amount of Notes which may
be outstanding at any one time under the Programme may be
increased from time to time, subject to compliance with the
relevant provisions of the Dealer Agreement as defined under
“Subscription and Sale”.

**Issuance in Series** Notes will be issued in Series. Each Series may comprise one or
more Tranches issued on different issue dates. The Notes of each
Series will all be subject to identical terms, except that the issue
date and the amount of the first payment of interest may be
different in respect of different Tranches. The Notes of each
Tranche will all be subject to identical terms in all respects save
that a Tranche may comprise Notes of different denominations.

**Forms of Notes** Notes may be issued in bearer form or in registered form. Bearer
Notes will not be exchangeable for Registered Notes and
Registered Notes will not be exchangeable for Bearer Notes. No
single Series or Tranche may comprise both Bearer Notes and

Each Tranche of Bearer Notes will initially be in the form of
either a Temporary Global Note or a Permanent Global Note
(each, a “Global Note”), in each case as specified in the relevant
Final Terms. Each Global Note which is not intended to be issued

which is intended to be issued in new global note form (a “New
**Global Note” or “NGN”), as specified in the relevant Final**
Terms, will be deposited on or around the relevant issue date with
a common safekeeper for Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
Luxembourg. Each Temporary Global Note will be

exchangeable for a Permanent Global Note or, if so specified in
the relevant Final Terms, for Definitive Notes. If the U.S. Treas.
Reg. section 1.163 5(c)(2)(i)(D) (or any successor rules in
substantially the same form that are applicable for purposes of
Section 4701 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”)) (the “TEFRA D Rules”) are specified in
the relevant Final Terms as applicable, certification as to nonU.S. beneficial ownership will be a condition precedent to any
exchange of an interest in a Temporary Global Note or receipt of
any payment of interest in respect of a Temporary Global Note.
Each Permanent Global Note will be exchangeable for Definitive
Notes in accordance with its terms. Definitive Notes will, if
interest-bearing, have Coupons attached and, if appropriate, a
Talon for further Coupons.

-----

Each Tranche of Registered Notes will be represented by either:

(i) Individual Note Certificates; or

(ii) one or more Global Registered Notes,

in each case as specified in the relevant Final Terms.

Each Note represented by a Global Registered Note will either
be: (a) in the case of a certificate which is not to be held under
the new safekeeping structure (“New Safekeeping Structure”
or “NSS”), registered in the name of a common depositary (or its
nominee) for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or
any other relevant clearing system and the relevant Global
Registered Note will be deposited on or about the issue date with
the common depositary; or (b) in the case of a certificate to be
held under the New Safekeeping Structure, be registered in the
name of a common safekeeper (or its nominee) for Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or any other relevant
clearing system and the relevant Global Registered Note will be
deposited on or about the issue date with the common safekeeper
for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg.

**Currencies** Notes may be denominated in any currency or currencies, subject
to compliance with all applicable legal and/or regulatory and/or
central bank requirements.

**Status of the Notes and the Guarantee** The Notes and the obligations of the Guarantor under the
Guarantee will constitute direct, general, unconditional and
(subject to Condition 5 (Negative Pledge)) unsecured obligations

Where Notes have a maturity of less than one year and either (a)
the issue proceeds are received by the Issuer in the United
Kingdom (“UK”) or (b) the activity of issuing the Notes is
carried on from an establishment maintained by the Issuer in the
UK, such Notes must: (i) have a minimum redemption value of
£100,000 (or its equivalent in other currencies) and be issued
only to persons whose ordinary activities involve them in
acquiring, holding, managing or disposing of investments (as
principal or agent) for the purposes of their businesses or who it
is reasonable to expect will acquire, hold, manage or dispose of
investments (as principal or agent) for the purposes of their
businesses; or (ii) be issued in other circumstances which do not
constitute a contravention of section 19 of the FSMA by the
Issuer.

**Redemption** Notes may be redeemable at par or at such other Redemption
Amount as may be specified in the relevant Final Terms or
Drawdown Prospectus. Notes may also be redeemable in 2 or
more instalments on such dates and in such manner as may be
specified in the relevant Final Terms or Drawdown Prospectus.

**Optional Redemption** Notes may be redeemed before their stated maturity at the option
of the Issuer (either in whole or in part) and/or the Noteholders
to the extent (if at all) specified in the relevant Final Terms or
Drawdown Prospectus, as further described in Conditions 8(c)
(Redemption and Purchase - Redemption at the option of the
_Issuer) and 8(g) (Redemption and Purchase - Redemption at the_
_option of Noteholders (Investor Put)) respectively._

In addition, if the relevant Final Terms or Drawdown Prospectus
so specifies, Noteholders shall have the option, in the event of a
Put Event, to require the Issuer to redeem or purchase the
relevant Notes as further described in Condition 8(h)
(Redemption and Purchase - Redemption or Purchase at the
_option of the Noteholders on a Put Event (Change of Control_
_Put))._

redemption for tax reasons will only be permitted as described in
Condition 8(b) (Redemption and Purchase - Redemption for tax
_reasons)._

**Interest** Notes may be interest-bearing or non-interest bearing. Interest (if
any) may accrue at a fixed rate or a floating rate.

**Denominations** The Notes will be issued in such denominations as may be agreed
between the Issuer and the relevant Dealer(s). No Notes may be
issued under the Programme which have a minimum
denomination of less than €100,000 (or nearly equivalent in
another currency) in the case of Notes to be admitted to trading
on a regulated market as defined in MiFID II, or in so far as
required by all applicable legal and/or regulatory and/or central

applicable legal and/or regulatory and/or central bank
requirements.

**Cross Default** The Notes will have the benefit of a cross default as described in
Condition 12 (Events of Default).

**Negative Pledge** The Notes will have the benefit of a negative pledge provision as
described in Condition 5 (Negative Pledge).

**Taxation** Payments in respect of Notes will be made without withholding
or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes,
duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature
imposed or levied by or on behalf of the Kingdom of Spain or
any political subdivision thereof or any authority or agency
therein or thereof having power to tax, unless the withholding or
deduction of such taxes, duties, assessments or governmental
charges is required by law. In that event, the Issuer, or as the case
may be, the Guarantor, will (subject to the exceptions provided
in Condition 11 (Taxation) and as described below) pay such
additional amounts as will result in the Noteholders receiving
such amounts as they would have received in respect of such
Notes had no such withholding or deduction been required (see
_“Taxation – Taxation in Spain – Information about the Notes in_
_connection with Payments”)._


**Information requirements under**
**Spanish Tax Law**

A44408936


Under Spanish Law 10/2014 and Royal Decree 1065/2007 as
amended, the Issuer is required to provide the Spanish tax
authorities with certain information relating to the Notes in a
timely manner.

If the Fiscal Agent fails to provide the Issuer with the required
information described under “Taxation — Taxation in Spain —
_Information about the Notes in connection with payments”, the_
Issuer may be required to withhold tax (as of the date of this Base
Prospectus, at a rate of 19%).

If this were to occur, affected Noteholders will receive a refund
of the amount withheld, with no need for action on their part, if
the Fiscal Agent submits the required information to the Issuer
no later than the 10[th] calendar day of the month immediately
following the relevant payment date. In addition, Noteholders
may apply directly to the Spanish tax authorities for any refund
to which they may be entitled. The Issuer will not pay additional
amounts in respect of any such withholding tax.

Investors should note that none of the Issuer, the Guarantor, the
Arranger, the Dealers or the Clearing Systems accept any
responsibility relating to the procedures established for the
collection of information concerning the Notes.

### RISK FACTORS

_Prospective investors should read the entire Base Prospectus. Words and expressions defined in the “Terms and_
_Conditions of the Notes” below or elsewhere in this Base Prospectus have the same meanings in this section._

_The Issuer and the Guarantor believe that the factors described below represent the principal risks inherent in_
_investing in Notes issued under the Programme as of the date of this Base Prospectus, and those are presented_
_in categories and in order of decreasing materiality within each category, taking into account both the probability_
_that they might occur as well as the expected magnitude of their negative impact. However, the inability of the_
_Issuer and the Guarantor to pay any amounts due on or in connection with any Notes, the Deed of Covenant or_
_the Deed of Guarantee, may occur for other reasons and the Issuer and the Guarantor do not represent that the_
_statements below regarding the risks of holding any Notes are exhaustive. There may also be other risks and_
_uncertainties of which the Issuer and the Guarantor are currently unaware or that the Issuer and the Guarantor_
_do not currently believe are material, that could harm the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations,_
_financial condition and cash flows and which if were to occur could affect their ability to fulfil its obligations_
_under Notes issued under the Programme. Consequently, the risks described below are not the only ones the_
_Issuer and the Guarantor_ _are exposed to. Prospective investors should also read the information set out elsewhere_
_in this Base Prospectus and reach their own view prior to making any investment decision._

_Investing in Notes issued under the Programme involves certain risks. Prospective investors should consider,_
_among other things, the following:_

### Risks Relating to the Issuer

**_The ability of the Issuer to meet its obligations under the Notes will depend upon Cellnex and other companies_**
**_within the Group meeting their corresponding obligations with the Issuer in a timely manner_**

The Issuer is a finance vehicle established by Cellnex for the purpose of carrying out financing activities and
financing-related support activities in favour of the companies in the Group. The Group assigned certain of its
financing contractual obligations to the Issuer, which became the borrower under such loans and credit facilities.
The Issuer may, on behalf of the Group, issue notes and other debt securities, enter into banking financings or
any other kind of financings or any instruments with a financing purpose, as well as grant financings and
guarantees in relation to the obligations assumed by the companies in the Group. Therefore, the Issuer’s principal
liabilities will comprise the Notes, other debt securities issued by it and the financings having been entered into
by the Issuer or assigned to the Issuer, and its principal assets will comprise its rights (if any) under loans to,
investments in, and arrangements with, the Group using the net proceeds from the issue of the Notes and other
debt securities and from financings to which the Issuer is a party from time to time, in accordance with its
corporate purpose (see “Description of the Issuer” for more information). Accordingly, in order to meet its
obligations under the Notes, the Issuer is dependent upon Cellnex and the other companies in the Group meeting
their obligations under such agreements in a timely fashion. The failure by them to do so in a timely fashion could
have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Issuer to fulfil its obligations under the Notes issued under the
Programme. The fact that Cellnex wholly owns the Issuer may limit the ability of the Issuer to enforce these
obligations.

### Risks Relating to the Guarantor and the Group

 Risks related to the industry and businesses in which the Group operates

 The business of the Group depends on the demand for the services that it provides and a substantial portion of the revenue of the Group is derived from a small number of major customers

The business of the Group includes the provision of services through its three different segments: (i) Telecom
Infrastructure Services, (ii) Broadcasting Infrastructure and (iii) Other Network Services (see “Description of the
_Guarantor” for further information). The Telecom Infrastructure Services segment is highly dependent on the_
demand for the Group’s telecom and broadcast wireless infrastructures and a decrease in such demand may
adversely affect the business of the Group. Within the Broadcasting Infrastructure segment, demand for
communication services and equipment depends on the coverage needs from the Group’s customers, which, in
turn, depend on the demand for TV and radio broadcast by their customers. Likewise, for the Other Network
Services segment, demand for connectivity, public protection and disaster relief (“PPDR”) networks, operation
and maintenance (“O&M”), smart city and Internet of Things (“IoT”) services depends on the demand from
public administrations as well as entities operating in the private and public sectors and optic fiber services. Any
factor adversely affecting the demand for such services, some of which are not under the control of the Group
(such as, for instance, those which are a consequence of the Coronavirus Pandemic (as defined herein)), could
potentially have a material adverse effect on the business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and
cash flows of the Group.

The development and commercialisation of new technologies designed to improve and enhance the range and
effectiveness of wireless telecom networks, either by the Group’s competitors or the Group itself, could
significantly decrease demand for existing infrastructure. For example, the Broadcasting Infrastructure segment’s
business is threatened due to substitute new technologies such as cable TV, satellite TV or OTTs.

In the Telecom Infrastructure Services segment, the Group cannot anticipate the evolution of its complementary
segments (such as 5G, “Small Cells” or distributed antenna system (“DAS” - a network of spatially separated
antenna nodes connected to a common source via a transport medium that provides wireless service within a
geographic area or structure), data centers/edge computing and optic fiber), which may become dominant
technologies in the future and render the current technologies and infrastructure of the Group obsolete.

The Group believes that any delays in 5G rollouts in Member States due to the Coronavirus Pandemic are likely
to be temporary rather than long lasting, considering the systemic importance of universal broadband access.
However, 5G rollouts could also be adversely affected by growing concerns, fueled in part by unreliable sources
propagated through social and other media, that 5G’s radio waves could pose health risks, which could materially
affect the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

The Group’s main clients are (i) in the Telecom Infrastructure Services segment, telecom operators (mostly
mobile network operators (“MNOs”)), (ii) in the Broadcasting Infrastructure segment, media broadcasters (TV
channels and radio stations) and (iii) in the Other Network Services segment a small number of public
administrations, at national, regional and/or local levels, safety and emergency response organisations, companies
operating in the utility sector and certain telecom operators. The extent to which MNOs contract for sites or space
on sites depends on a number of factors beyond the Group’s control, including the level of demand for mobile
services, the financial condition and access to capital of such MNOs, the strategy of MNOs with respect to owning
or leasing sites, changes in telecommunications regulations, general economic conditions and population density.
Demand for sites or space on sites can be adversely affected by changes in government regulations applicable to
MNOs, which can negatively affect the number of users of mobile services or the expansion plans of MNOs, both
of which could adversely affect the demand for sites or space on sites.

A44408936

## 8


-----

As European MNOs are moving towards a less infrastructural business model, the share trends in the
telecommunications sector are increasing, especially given the upcoming 5G technological cycle. In this context,
the Group may need to reinforce its offer in order to meet the needs of its customers, increasingly investing in
asset-class businesses adjacent to telecommunication towers, such as fiber, edge computing and “Small Cells”.

Moreover, the demand for the Group’s services may be affected by MNOs utilizing shared equipment (both in
the form of passive and active network sharing) rather than deploying new equipment. This may result in the
decommissioning of equipment on certain existing infrastructures because parts of the customers’ networks may
become redundant. Any potential merger, strategic alliance (for example, active network sharing) or consolidation
of the Group’s customers would likely result in duplicate or overlapping networks, which may result in the
termination or non-renewal of customer contracts (for example where they are co-customers using the same
infrastructure) and in the loss of future commercial opportunities resulting in a lower number of potential
customers for the Group. Generally, the Group’s contracts with customers do not provide as a cause for
termination the merger, strategic alliances or consolidation of such customers, and therefore, any termination as
referred to above would entail a breach of contract.

A reduction in demand for sites or space on sites resulting from any of the factors described above could materially
adversely affect the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

The Group has two customers that contributed approximately 16% and approximately 13% (€259,942 thousand
and €206,558 thousand, respectively) of its total operating income for the year ended 31 December 2020. One of
these customers contributed approximately 20% (€201,710 thousand) of the Group’s total operating income for
the year ended 31 December 2019, restated. The agreements reached with these two customers have a long-term
initial maturity and may only be renewed for the entire portfolio and not for a portion thereof. The Group does
not have any other customers that contributed more than 10% of its total operating income for the years ended 31
December 2020 or 2019, restated. The next five customers (after the two customers referred to above for the year
ended 31 December 2020, and after the customer referred to above for the year ended 31 December 2019,
restated) contributed in aggregate approximately 26% and 34% to the Group’s total operating income for the
years ended 31 December 2020 and 2019, restated, respectively.

The Group is affected by changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of a small number of major
customers, especially the two major customers referred to above. The Group depends on the continued financial
strength of such customers, which operate with substantial leverage and many of which are not investment grade
or do not have a credit rating. Adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of any of the Group’s
major customers, including as a result of the Coronavirus Pandemic, may result in decreased demand for the
Group’s services, if at all, or expose the Group to the possibility of one or more breaches of their obligations to
the Group, which may in turn materially adversely affect the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows.

The Group cannot guarantee that contracts with its major customers will not be terminated (including contractual
agreements to transfer or build sites under the Group’s acquisition agreements, purchase commitments and buildto-suit programs), or that these customers will renew their contracts with the Group on the same terms or at all,
including due to disagreements regarding certain terms or matters or otherwise. Any of the above could potentially
have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and
cash flows. Further, the Group is exposed to constant renegotiation and renewal processes of its contracts with
its customers (especially those related to the Other Network Services segment and Broadcasting Infrastructure
segment), which may result in the current contractual arrangements being adversely amended, which could in
turn affect the total value of its contracts. The Group completed last year a general cycle of renewal of contracts
in the Broadcasting Infrastructures segment that has led to a downward revision of prices paid by the Group’s
customers. Contracts in the Other Network Services and the Broadcasting Infrastructure segments have generally

A44408936

## 9


-----

shorter terms than contracts in the Telecom Infrastructures Services segment, and accordingly they need to be
renewed more frequently.

In addition, the maturities of the lease contracts, sub-lease contracts and other types of contracts with third parties
to operate and manage land and rooftops where the Group’s telecommunications infrastructures are located, are
generally shorter than the contracts that the Group has entered into with its customers for the provision of services
in such infrastructures. As a result, there is a mismatch in the maturities of both contractual relationships which
could prevent the Group from successfully providing agreed upon services to its customers, as the Group may
not have access to primary resources essential to execute such contractual obligations. The real property interests
of the Group relating to its infrastructures consist primarily of ownership interests, fee interests, easements,
licenses and rights-of-way. Land owners could decide not to renew, or to adversely amend the terms of, the land
lease contracts with the relevant Group company, or landlords may lose their rights to the land they own, or they
may transfer their land interests to third parties. In addition, members of the Group may in the future become
involved in disputes with their landlords, which could interfere with the Group’s operation of a given site or force
the Group to build new sites in order to continue providing services to its customers. The Group’s inability to
negotiate rent renewals on attractive terms, or to protect its rights to the land on which its infrastructures are
located, may result in an increase in costs and may interfere with the Group’s ability to operate infrastructures
and generate revenues. Any damage or destruction to the Group’s infrastructure due to unforeseen events,
including natural disasters or acts of vandalism, may impact the Group’s ability to conduct its business.
Additionally, if the loss of service is not deemed to be due to an unforeseeable force majeure event, the Group
could be held responsible for failing to satisfy its obligations under its transmission contracts, which could result
in service credit penalties or suspension of normal fees and annual charges. If any of these events were to occur
to a significant extent, this could result in a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, prospects, results of
operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In addition, some contracts entered into by the Group provide that certain expenses are passed through to the
Group’s customers, such as energy costs. The Group cannot guarantee that the pass through mechanism will
protect 100% of the energy cost borne by the Group during the full term of the contract, which may have a
material adverse effect on the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash
flows. If the Group were found to be engaged in the electricity resale business because it includes energy costs
in the charges for which it bills its customers it could be required to change its business practices or be subject to
fines or other remedies as electricity supply is a regulated activity in countries where the Group operates.

Although the expansion and increased geographical diversification of the Group has contributed to the
diversification of its customer base, the Group’s reliance on a relatively small group of major customers may
adversely affect the development of its business. As such, the loss of one or more of any of the Group’s main
customers, resulting from, amongst others, a merger or a strategic alliance (for example, active network sharing),
bankruptcy, insolvency, network sharing, loss of licenses, roaming, joint development, resale agreements or
contract early termination may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, prospects, results of
operations, financial condition and cash flows.

### The expansion or development of the business of the Group, including through acquisitions or other growth opportunities, involves a number of risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect its operating results or disrupt its operations

The Group’s strategy is aimed at strengthening and expanding its operations, including through the acquisition
of assets, entities or minority interests (including minority stakes in companies where the Group already holds a
majority interest), joint ventures, mergers and other arrangements in the countries where the Group currently
operates or elsewhere, which could require, among other matters, new debt and the issuance of shares (of Cellnex
or its affiliates) to finance such growth opportunities and in the case of acquisitions of minority interests as
described above, payments of prices which are inflationary, strongly revaluated, or higher than the original price

A44408936

## 10


-----

paid by the Group (as it is already agreed upon in the relevant shareholders agreements). Since Cellnex’s shares
were admitted to listing on the Spanish Stock Exchanges in May 2015 and until the date of this Base Prospectus,
the Group has entered into numerous transactions by virtue of which the Group has invested or committed to
invest approximately €36.3 billion in the acquisition or construction of up to 117.0 thousand infrastructures to be
acquired or built by 2030 once the CK Hutchison Holdings Transaction in respect of the United Kingdom and the
Hivory Acquisition (all as defined herein) are closed (which, together with the infrastructures already owned at
the time of such listing and those added to the portfolio as a result of other initiatives carried out throughout the
2015-2021 period, such as the acquisition of small portfolios that have not been disclosed separately, amount to
an aggregate of up to 128.9 thousand infrastructures, a substantial part of which is subject to build-to-suit
programs). For information on risks associated with the comparability of the Group’s consolidated financial
information due to the transactions that the Group regularly enters into, see “Risks related to the financial
_information incorporated by reference in this Base Prospectus and other financial risks–The historical_
_consolidated financial information only takes into account the transactions completed as of each reporting_
_period”._

This growth strategy has contributed to the Group’s accounting losses in recent years and exposes the Group to
operational challenges and risks, such as the need to identify potential acquisition opportunities on favourable
terms, the diversion of management’s attention from existing business, the potential impairment of acquired
intangible assets, including goodwill, or the acquisition of liabilities or other claims from acquired businesses,
including liabilities under “successor liability” doctrines in connection with employment, pension, tax, regulatory,
environmental, accounting and other matters, which may significantly impact the value of the acquired target and
the overall viability and success of the intended business.

Prior to entering into an acquisition agreement, the Group generally performs due diligence with respect to the
target or the relevant assets, but such inspection is limited by its nature. Additionally, the Group’s analysis and
risk evaluation prior to entering into any acquisition agreements, are based on the accuracy and completeness of
the information available to the Group. The Group may not independently verify the accuracy or completeness
of certain of the information made available to it in the context of its due diligence procedures.

Any assets acquired by the Group may be subject to hidden material defects that were not apparent or that
otherwise the Group failed to discover or consider at the time of the acquisition. To the extent the Group or other
third parties underestimated or failed to identify risks and liabilities associated with an acquisition, the Group
may incur, directly or indirectly, in unexpected liabilities, such as defects in title, an inability to obtain permits
enabling the Group to use the underlying infrastructure as intended, or other environmental, structural or
operational defects or liabilities requiring remediation. Failure to identify any such defects, liabilities or risks or
to adequately address any such defects, liabilities or risks could expose the Group to unanticipated costs and
liabilities or could result in the Group having acquired assets which are not consistent with its investment strategy,
which are difficult to integrate within its portfolio, which fail to perform in accordance with expectations, and/or
which adversely affect the Group’s reputation, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s
business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In addition, achieving the benefits of new acquisitions depends in part on the timely and efficient integration of
the acquired business operations, communications infrastructure portfolio and personnel. Integration may be
difficult and unpredictable for many reasons, including, among other things, differing financial, accounting,
reporting, information technology and other systems and processes, cultural differences, differences in customary
business practices and conflicting policies, procedures and operations. In addition, integrating businesses may
significantly burden management and internal resources. There could also be integration risks related to the
commercialisation of the spaces where newly acquired sites are located, as well as in connection with the
transition of the payments, the retention of existing customers on newly acquired sites, including obtaining the
necessary prior consents to assign the relevant services agreements, and the implementation of the Group’s

A44408936

## 11


-----

standards, controls, procedures and policies with regards to any newly acquired towers. The Group may also face
the risk of failing to efficiently and effectively integrate the new assets into the Group’s existing business or to
use such assets to their full capacity.

The Group’s growth strategy is also linked, among other factors, to the capacity to successfully decommission
and build new infrastructures. The framework agreements signed with anchor customers may include agreements
for the further acquisition or construction of infrastructures over a defined period of time or for the acquisition or
construction of a maximum number of infrastructures. Such framework agreements may or may not be wholly
implemented due to a potential integration or consolidation of the Group’s customers or due to a change in their
business strategy or to the impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic, among others. In addition, framework agreements
with anchor customers may include the unilateral right of the customer to dismiss a low single-digit percentage
of the total sites per year. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business,
prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, the build-to-suit programs are
executed on the basis of agreements with third-party suppliers or the customers that will use the new
infrastructures, and so the Group relies on third-parties to effectively execute its contractual obligations.
Moreover, the Group may face additional challenges in managing its expansion into new countries or into
countries where the Group may have limited knowledge and understanding of the local market, business
relationships and familiarity with the local governmental procedures and regulations.

In the ordinary course of its business, the Group reviews, analyses and evaluates potential transactions, assets,
interests, activities or potential arrangements that the Group believes may add value to its business or its scope
of services. Failure to timely identify growth opportunities may adversely affect the expansion or development
of the Group’s business. In addition, the failure to correctly assess the terms and conditions of potential
transactions could imply unexpected costs to the Group, or could prevent the Group from obtaining the full benefit
of the related business expansion (e.g., by way of changes in the expected perimeter of the relevant transaction
upon closing), or any benefit at all, any of which could in turn materially and adversely affect the Group’s
business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Moreover, the Group may fail to
sufficiently assess the price adjustments that should be effected to account for potential changes in the perimeter
of the target, or may fail to successfully effect them, which could imply unexpected costs to the Group and could
materially and adversely affect the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash
flows.

The Group may face contingencies, including delays, in the implementation of its growth through acquisitions
strategy (including due to the lack of suitable acquisitions, the failure to negotiate and agree acceptable purchase
agreements or the failure to satisfactorily complete due diligence). In addition, the completion of any pending or
future acquisitions may be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, some of which may not be
within the Group’s control, and failure to satisfy such conditions may prevent, delay or otherwise materially
adversely affect the completion of the relevant acquisition. As such, there is no assurance that any such pending
or future acquisitions will be completed or, if completed, that it will be completed on the same terms as are
described in the transaction agreements. For example, necessary regulatory or administrative authorisations or
approvals, including antitrust approvals, may be refused or may only be granted by way of the provision of certain
remedies, involving divestitures or otherwise, on onerous terms, and any such refusal or imposition of remedies,
involving divestitures or otherwise, on onerous terms may limit the Group’s ability to grow its portfolio of assets
in a particular market or jurisdiction as expected or at all, or may result in significant delays and/or significant
unexpected costs in relation to a particular acquisition.

Even if compliant with antitrust legislation, the Group may not be able to consummate such transactions,
undertake such activities or implement new services successfully due to disruptions in its activities, increased
risk of operations or other consequences which could negatively impact the Group’s business and its prospects.
In addition, the loss of the Group’s neutral position (for example, by having one or more MNOs as a significant

A44408936

## 12


-----

shareholder represented in the Board of Directors and other governance bodies of Cellnex) may cause sellers of
infrastructure assets to be reluctant to enter into new joint ventures, mergers, disposals or other arrangements with
the Group, and adversely impact its organic growth. As the Group increases its size, management expects that
large MNOs may be open to collaborating with the Group in several ways, such as by selling their sites or other
infrastructure assets to the Group, including in exchange for shares, which could negatively impact the Group’s
business and its prospects as this type of transactions could affect the perception of the Group’s neutrality.

Market conditions and other factors, such as the Group’s competitors’ willingness to also expand their businesses
through the acquisition of the same assets, entities or minority interests that the Group seeks to acquire, may also
adversely affect the Group’s ability to identify and execute acquisitions or increase the acquisition costs.

Additionally, the Group may experience at any time increased competition in certain areas of activity from
established and new competitors, for example as a result of other infrastructure providers entering the European
market. Further, any such competitors could become a significant landlord of the Group’s portfolio. The Group’s
main competitors are Vantage Towers, Telxius (which recently sold its telecommunication towers division in
Europe and in Latin America to American Tower), Inwit, TDF, Hivory (until completion of the Hivory
Acquisition), CTIL, MBNL (until completion of the CK Hutchison Holdings Transaction in respect of the United
Kingdom), American Tower and Phoenix Tower. The industry is competitive and customers have access to
alternatives in telecom infrastructure services and other network services, whereas for broadcasting TV the
alternatives are more limited. Where the Group acts as a provider of services, competitive pricing from
competitors could affect the Group’s rates and services income. In addition, competition in infrastructure services
could also increase the cost of acquisition of assets and limit the Group’s ability to grow its business. Moreover,
the Group may not be able to renew existing services agreements or enter into new ones. Higher prices for assets,
combined with the competitive pricing pressure on services agreements, could make it more difficult for the
Group to achieve its return on investment criteria. Increasing competition for the acquisition of infrastructure
assets or companies in the context of the Group’s business expansion could make the acquisition of high quality
assets significantly more costly (in the current low interest rate business environment and taking into
consideration the nature of the Group’s business, with long-term contracts and fixed fees which are normally
inflation-linked, infrastructure funds and private equity firms are showing increasing appetite towards this class
of assets), and could materially and adversely affect the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows. Some competitors are larger than the Group and may have greater financial
resources, while other competitors may apply investment criteria with lower return on investment requirements.
Likewise, the Group also faces competition or may face future competition from its peers. In addition, some of
the Group’s customers have set up their own infrastructure companies and more European MNOs are increasingly
showing their willingness to establish their own infrastructure vehicles, which could lead to increases in the
demand for assets for sale (thus leading to increases in asset prices), as well as increased competition in the
ordinary course of the Group’s business, limiting potential growth. If the Group is unable to compete effectively
with such customers and other competitors, or to effectively anticipate or respond to customer needs or consumer
sentiment, it could lose existing and potential customers, which could reduce the Group’s operating margins and
have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and
cash flows.

The Group is also subject to a number of construction, service provision, financing, operating, regulatory and
other risks related to the development, expansion and maintenance of its infrastructure, many of which are beyond
its control. The operation, administration, maintenance and repair of some of the Group’s infrastructures requires
coordination and integration of highly sophisticated and specialized hardware and software technologies and
equipment, which, consequently, require significant operating expenses and capital expenditures, as well as
highly-qualified personnel with the relevant technical know-how. Any failure in the functioning of any of such
technologies or equipment may expose the Group to reputational risks, as well as the risk of losing clients,
amongst others.

There are additional risks associated with doing business internationally, including changes in a specific country’s
or region’s political or economic conditions, inflation, deflation or currency devaluation, expropriation, unwind
of state aids, subsidies and contracts or governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership or requiring
reversion or divestiture, increases in the cost of labour (as a result of unionisation or otherwise), power and other
goods and services required for the Group’s operations and changes in consumer price indexes in foreign countries
which could adversely affect the Group’s results of operations. See “The business of the Group may be affected
_by adverse economic and political conditions in the countries where the Group carries out its activities and_
_globally”._

As a result, the Group is unable to predict the timeline for the successful execution of its growth strategy and
there is no guarantee that the Group will be successful in identifying such acquisitions or making any investments
in a timely manner or at all. Generally, if the Group cannot identify, implement or integrate attractive acquisition
opportunities on favourable terms or at all, or if the Group’s foreign operations and expansion initiatives do not
succeed as expected, they could adversely affect the Group’s ability to execute its growth strategy. Any of the
foregoing could materially and adversely affect the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, financial
condition and cash flows.

### The triggering of a change of control clause contained in the contracts entered into by the Group or a breach of contractual obligations may result in an obligation to repay debt early or to sell back assets 

Certain material contracts entered into by the Group, including the Group’s material debt agreements and most
of the Group’s agreements with anchor customers, could be modified or terminated if a change of control clause
is triggered. A change of control clause may be triggered if a third-party, either alone or in conjunction with
others, obtains “significant influence” and/or “control” (which is generally defined as having (i) more than 50%
of shares with voting rights (except in a few exceptional cases where this threshold is defined as having 29% or
more of shares with voting rights) or (ii) the right to appoint or dismiss the majority of the members of the board
of directors of the relevant Group company). A change of control clause may be triggered at the level of Cellnex
or only at the level of the relevant subsidiary that has entered into the relevant contract. In certain contracts, the
definition of control, and therefore of a change of control, makes specific reference to the applicable law in the
relevant jurisdiction.

With regards to the material contracts entered into by the Group with anchor customers, the triggering of a change
of control provision is generally limited to events where the acquiring company is a competitor of the anchor
customer. In such circumstances, the anchor customer may be granted an option to buy back assets (generally the
infrastructures where they are being serviced). In addition, such buy back option can also be granted in the event
that a direct competitor of the anchor customer acquires a significant portion of the relevant Group company’s
shares or obtains voting or governance rights which can be exercised in a way that can negatively affect the
anchor customer’s interests.

Additionally, the Notes issued under the Programme, other debt securities issued by the Issuer and Cellnex, the
convertible bonds issued by Cellnex and the bank financing contracts of the Group include certain change of
control clauses which could trigger an early repayment under the respective debt arrangement.

Finally, asset buy back options can also be exercised in case of an explicit breach by a Group company of the
contractual obligations under services level agreements with its customers (“SLAs”). These asset buy back
options will be executed at a price below fair market valuation. In addition, the Group may enter into contracts
related to joint future investments that have a buy back clause whereby the customer has the right to acquire the
related assets during defined periods. While the Group’s management currently believes that the likelihood of
exercising such option is not high, given it would require the relevant customer to make a significant payment to
the Group, the Group can provide no assurance that any such options will not be exercised.

A44408936

## 14


-----

If a change of control clause included in any of the Group’s material contracts is triggered, or if a company of the
Group fails to comply with its contractual obligations under an SLA or a joint investment agreement, it may
materially and adversely affect the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash
flows.

### The Group’s backlog estimates are based on certain assumptions and are subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and thus may not be converted to revenues in any particular fiscal period, if at all, or be a fully accurate indicator of the Group’s future revenue or earnings

Expected contracted revenues from services agreements (backlog) represent management’s estimate of the
amount of contracted revenues that the Group expects will result in future revenue from certain existing contracts.
Backlog, as included in this Base Prospectus, is based on a number of assumptions and estimates, including
assumptions related to the performance of a number of the existing contracts at a particular date, but does not
include adjustments for inflation or deflation. One of the main assumptions for calculating backlog is the
automatic renewal of contracts for services with the Group’s anchor customers. Most contracts with anchor
customers of the Telecom Infrastructure Services segment have term extension clauses including, in some cases,
“all-or-nothing” extension clauses that only allow the extension of the term of a contract for the entire portfolio
(not the extension of a portion thereof) on terms that are generally pre-agreed and the application of which may
result in an increase or a decrease in price of the service, within certain parameters. In addition, the Group
calculates backlog assuming that acquisitions which are subject to the satisfaction of conditions precedent will
be completed on the terms described in the applicable transaction agreements in their entirety. However, there is
no assurance that any pending or future acquisitions will be completed or, if completed, that they will be
completed on such same terms. For example, necessary regulatory or administrative authorisations or approvals,
including antitrust approvals, may be refused or may only be granted by way of the provision of certain remedies,
involving divestitures or otherwise, on onerous terms, which may limit the Group’s ability to grow its portfolio
of assets in a particular market or jurisdiction as expected or at all. As a result, the assumptions the Group uses
to calculate backlog may prove to be incorrect, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the Group’s backlog
estimates.

The earliest contract renewals in the Telecom Infrastructure Services segment are expected to occur in 2022 and
2023 with Telefónica. This will be the first time that a contract containing an “all-or-nothing” extension clause is
up for renewal. Contracts with most of the Group’s customers in the Broadcasting Infrastructure segment will
face a new cycle of renewals in 2025 (although one of the main contracts will be up for renewal in 2021). In
addition, certain contracts for services with customers may be cancelled under certain circumstances by the
customer at short notice without penalty. The termination of the contracts (“Churn”) with customers in the
Telecom Infrastructure Services and Broadcasting Infrastructure segments may materially and adversely affect
the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It should also be noted
that contracts in place with Telefónica and Wind Tre may be subject to changes in relation to the fees being
applied at a time of a renewal, set within a predefined range taking into account the last annual fee (which reflects
the cumulative inflation of the full initial term).

In addition, the Group’s definition and calculation of backlog may not necessarily be the same as that used by
other companies engaged in activities similar to that of the Group. As a result, the amount of its backlog may not
be comparable to the backlog reported by such other companies. The realisation of the Group’s backlog estimates
is further affected by its performance under contracts. The Group’s ability to execute its backlog is dependent on
its ability to meet its clients’ operational needs, and if it is unable to meet such needs, the Group’s ability to
execute its backlog could be adversely affected, which could materially affect the Group’s business, prospects,
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. There can be no assurance that the revenue projected in
the Group’s backlog will be realised or, if realised, will result in profit. Because of potential changes in the scope
or schedule of the services the Group provides to its clients, it cannot predict with certainty when or if the Group’s

A44408936

## 15


-----

backlog will be realised. In the case of “Engineering Services”, that are pre-agreed and associated to incremental
fees, they may be phased over a longer than expected period of time, reduced or even cancelled, seriously
affecting the management's estimate of contracted revenues over time. Even where a project proceeds as
scheduled, it is possible that the client may default and fail to pay amounts owed to the Group. Delays, payment
defaults or cancellations, including as a result of the Coronavirus Pandemic, could reduce the amount of backlog
currently estimated, and consequently, could inhibit the conversion of that backlog into revenues, which would
in turn materially affect the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

### The business of the Group may be affected by adverse economic and political conditions in the countries where the Group carries out its activities and globally

Notwithstanding the Group’s diversification of its risk exposure through the internationalisation of its operations,
the Group cannot assure that the countries where it operates will not experience economic or political difficulties
in the future.

The Group’s customers in European markets such as Spain, Italy, France and the United Kingdom represent a
significant portion of the operating income of the Group, therefore especially exposing it to risks affecting these
countries. For the year ended 31 December 2020, approximately 33% (€530,328 thousand), 21% (€336,296
thousand), 19% (€309,759 thousand) and 9% (€144,339 thousand) of the Group’s operating income was
generated in Spain, Italy, France and the United Kingdom, respectively. In addition, the Group will increase its
presence in the United Kingdom and France following completion of the CK Hutchison Holdings Transaction in
respect of the United Kingdom and the Hivory Acquisition, and therefore will also be especially exposed to risks
affecting those countries.

Adverse economic conditions may have a negative impact on demand for the services the Group provides and on
its customers’ ability to meet their payment obligations. In periods of recession, the demand for services provided
by the Group tends to decline, adversely affecting the Group’s results of operations. A negative or low growth
cycle could affect the Group in the European markets where the Group operates as of the date of this Base
Prospectus (in particular, in those countries where there are customers which represent a significant portion of
the operating income of the Group).

This may be further accentuated by a potential recession in the markets where the Group operates and in others
as a result of the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic (the “Coronavirus Pandemic”) which began in China in late
2019 and has subsequently spread globally, significantly affecting the European markets where the Group
operates as of the date of this Base Prospectus (in particular, in those countries where there are customers which
represent a significant portion of the operating income of the Group). The uncertainty surrounding the
Coronavirus Pandemic and its effects on the global economy, as of the date of this Base Prospectus, are expected
to significantly impact global growth in future periods, due to the restriction or suspension of production,
operational and business activities, disruptions to travel and transportation and adverse impacts on labour supply
affecting both supply and demand chains. In addition to affecting demand for the Group’s services (or the Group’s
customers’ services) and its customers’ ability to meet their payment obligations, the Coronavirus Pandemic
could, among other effects, also depress the value of the Group’s assets and investments, limit the Group’s ability
to finance its future operations and capital needs, disrupt the Group’s supply chain, generate or lead to deflation
(reducing the revenue of the Group in the future, considering that most of the Group’s contracts with customers
are inflation-linked), disrupt the Group’s growth plans and increase the likelihood and/or magnitude of other risks
described in this Base Prospectus. While the Group’s business activity has remained largely unaffected by the
Coronavirus Pandemic, the extent to which the Coronavirus Pandemic impacts the Group’s business and results
of operations in the future will depend on future developments. For example, the Group could suffer delays in
the execution of build-to-suit programs, changes in the expected organic growth or severe disruptions due to its
suppliers being unable to meet their current commitments. The Group cannot assure that any estimates, forecasts,
forward-looking statements or opinions contained herein or which may have been expressed in the past will

A44408936

## 16


-----

remain accurate or will not abruptly change as a result of the spread and effects of the Coronavirus Pandemic.
Moreover, the Group’s inability to reduce the impact of the foregoing could have a material and adverse effect
on its business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

Likewise, the Group is directly exposed to adverse political conditions in the European markets where the Group
operates as of the date of this Base Prospectus (in particular, in those countries where there are customers which
represent a significant portion of the operating income of the Group). Also, changes in the international financial
markets’ conditions as a result of the Coronavirus Pandemic pose a challenge to the Group’s ability to adapt to
them as they may have an impact on its business. The Group cannot predict how the economic and political cycle
in such markets will develop in the short-term or in the coming years, or whether there will be a deterioration in
political stability in them.

Therefore, the Group may be adversely affected by the adverse economic conditions or potential instability in the
European markets where the Group operates as of the date of this Base Prospectus (in particular, in those countries
where there are customers which represent a significant portion of the operating income of the Group), while at
the same time a more geographically diversified revenue source allows a lower risk exposure to specific countryrelated issues. In addition, the Group may be adversely affected by economic, social and political conditions in
the countries in which its customers, suppliers and other counterparties operate.

Countries or supranational organizations, such as the European Union (the “EU”), in the markets where the Group
or its customers operate may develop and implement legislation, adopt decisions or otherwise change laws,
regulations and treaties, or their interpretation thereof, which could materially and adversely affect the Group’s
business, prospects and results of operations. The European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple
countries focusing on whether local rulings or local legislation violate EU state aid rules and concluded that
certain countries, including Spain, have provided illegal state aid in certain cases. The decisions of the European
Commission and the national authorities in relation to such investigations, and any such changes to laws,
regulations and treaties, or their interpretation thereof, and any related expropriation, cancellation, unwind, clawback and recovery of state aids and subsidies could materially and adversely affect the Group’s business,
prospects and results of operations.

Because of the Group’s significant presence in the United Kingdom, it may face the risk of political and economic
uncertainty derived from the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the EU which became effective on 31 January
2020 (“Brexit”). Prior to that, on 24 January 2020, the United Kingdom signed the Agreement on the withdrawal
of the United Kingdom from the EU and the European Atomic Energy Community (the “Withdrawal
**Agreement”). Under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement, a transition period ran until 31 December 2020,**
during which time the United Kingdom continued to benefit from, and was bound by, many EU laws. On 24
December 2020, the EU and the United Kingdom entered into three agreements setting out the terms of their
future relationship. These are the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the Agreement on Nuclear Cooperation, and
the Agreement on Security Procedures for Exchanging and Protecting Classified Information, each of which
applies provisionally until formally ratified by both parties. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement covers the
general objectives and framework of the relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU, including in
relation to trade, transport, visas, judicial, law enforcement and security matters, and mechanisms for dispute
resolution. Under the terms of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the United Kingdom firms no longer benefit
from automatic access to the EU single market and there is no longer free movement of people between the United
Kingdom and the EU. As of the date of this Base Prospectus, the application of the Trade and Cooperation
Agreement is unclear and its effect on the United Kingdom economy and markets is unknown. In addition, while
domestic law derived from EU law, EU law directly applicable in the United Kingdom, and EU rights, powers,
liabilities and obligations recognised and available in the United Kingdom, in each case immediately before 31
December 2020, were, subject to certain exceptions, retained by the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom’s law
may diverge from EU law in the future. The legal, political and economic uncertainty resulting from Brexit may

A44408936

## 17


-----

adversely affect the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in the
United Kingdom, in particular because of the Group’s significant presence in the United Kingdom (which will
be further increased upon completion of the CK Hutchison Holdings Transaction in respect of the United
Kingdom).

Growing public debt, reduced growth rates and any measures of monetary policy that may be implemented in the
future in the credit markets all could affect the Group’s business. A change in any of these factors could affect the
access of the Group to the capital markets and the terms and conditions under which it can access such capital,
which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, financial
condition and cash flows. Moreover, as a significant portion of the contracts of the Group with operators are
inflation-linked and some do not have a minimum limit or floor, deflationary macroeconomic circumstances will
have an adverse effect on the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash
flows. In addition, the Group cannot assure that any estimates, forecasts, forward-looking statements or opinions
contained herein or which may have been expressed in the past will remain accurate or will not abruptly change
as a result of the spread and effects of the Coronavirus Pandemic. Moreover, the Group’s inability to reduce the
impact of the foregoing could have a material and adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects.

### The Group’s status as a “significant market power” (“SMP”) operator in the digital terrestrial television (“DTT”) broadcasting transmission service market in Spain imposes certain detrimental obligations on it compared to its competitors

In 2006, when the Spanish terrestrial TV broadcast market was articulated, the Group was classified as a SMP
operator by the competition authorities. Given its dominant market position, the National Commission of Markets
and Competition (Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y de la Competencia, or “CNMC”, the former Comisión
_del Mercado de las Telecomunicaciones, or “CMT”) imposed certain conditions (regulatory remedies) on it to_
allow it to operate in the broadcasting market which, amongst others, set out that if the Group is not able to reach
a voluntary commercial agreement with an operator, the CNMC will dictate the commercial conditions of the
agreements. The CNMC has introduced certain flexibility to those conditions as per the latest regulation of the
market, carried out in 2019 which concluded on 17 July 2019 with the publication of the Resolution approving
the definition and analysis of the wholesale market for the television broadcasting transmission service (Market
18/2003), as notified to the European Commission and the European Electronic Communications Regulators
Entity.

The competitors of the Group in the market who are not considered to be a SMP operator because of their low
market share and limited coverage capacity are not subject to these obligations. These obligations and potential
additional obligations imposed on the Group by the competition authorities vis-à-vis its competitors could
materially and adversely affect the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash
flows.

### Spectrum may not be secured in the future, which would prevent or impair the plans of the Group or limit the need for the Group’s services and products and other basic resources to provide service may not be guaranteed

The Group and its customers are highly dependent on the availability of sufficient spectrum for the provision of
certain services. The amount of spectrum available is limited and the process for obtaining it is highly complex
and costly.

In the Broadcasting Infrastructure segment, the Group owns the infrastructures and equipment that TV and radio
broadcasters use to compress and distribute their signals in Spain. In particular, the Group distributes and
transmits signals for DTT, the leading TV platform in Spain. The evolution of technology standards, formats and
coding technologies is likely to influence the future spectrum demand for broadcasting services. Even if the Group

A44408936

## 18


-----

currently uses “multiplexing”, a method by which multiple analogue signals or digital data streams are combined
into one signal over a shared medium, with the aim of maximizing the limited capacity of the spectrum, the Group
cannot guarantee that its customers or DTT broadcasters will have sufficient access to spectrum in the long-term
to maintain and develop its current services.

The Spanish government is responsible for the allocation of spectrum in Spain. In this context, following the EU
regulation in this matter, it passed Royal Decree 391/2019 approving the new National Technical Plan for DTT
and the regulation of certain aspects of the liberalization of the “second Digital Dividend”. This Royal Decree
states that the sub-700 megahertz (“MHz”) will continue to be used for television broadcasting until, at least,
2030. Nonetheless, since the allocation of spectrum is decided by the Spanish government, the Group is highly
dependent on political decisions for the future of its DTT broadcasting business, which decisions are outside of
its control. In the event that the number of private multiplex (“MUX”) available for DTT is further reduced, the
Group’s customers could lose some of its current DTT multiplex spectrum currently licensed.

The Group depends upon spectrum allocation for many other wireless services that it provides, either in the
Broadcasting Infrastructure segment, Telecom Infrastructure Services segment or Other Network Services
segment, such as Frequency Modulation (“FM”), Digital Audio Broadcasting (“DAB/DAB+”), terrestrial trunked
radio (“TETRA”), IoT and radio links. The Group cannot guarantee that the spectrum needed to appropriately
render its services or the spectrum needed by its customers will be available in the future, and any change in
spectrum allocation could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows.

The licenses and assigned frequency usage rights that the Group uses for services such as connectivity have a
finite maturity. The Group could be unable to renew or obtain its licenses and frequency usage rights necessary
for its business upon expiration of their terms or it may have to make significant investments to maintain its
licenses, either of which could have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows.

### Cyber-attacks, security breaches or other critical disruptions in the Group’s technical or information infrastructure could result in material harm to its performance or its reputation

The Group works with sophisticated technical and advanced information technology infrastructure to operate its
business and deliver its services to its customers. These systems and services could be vulnerable to interruptions
or other failures resulting from, among other things, software, equipment or telecommunications failures,
processing errors, computer viruses and malware, cyber-attacks or other security issues or supplier defaults. The
Group’s security measures could also be breached due to human error, malfeasance or otherwise. Such security
measures could also be violated as a result of a third-party fraudulent attempt to access the Group’s sensitive
information, by means of inducing an employee to breach the system or directly violating its security measures.
Cyber-attacks or breaches of security measures implemented to the Group’s systems could impair its ability to
adequately carry out its operations. Likewise, cyber-attacks, security breaches or intrusions upon the Group’s
information technology infrastructure could potentially compromise the security of information stored in or
transmitted through its systems, or even potentially compromise the integrity of its technical systems more
broadly. Cyber-security risks have been exacerbated by the remote working environment implemented worldwide
as a result of the Coronavirus Pandemic. While the Group has been able to control cyber-attacks and security
breaches in the past, there is no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so in the future, particularly due
to the increasing occurrence and sophistication of cyber-attacks and security breaches. In the year ended 31
December 2020, the Group devoted € 1,484 thousand (€711 thousand in the year ended 31 December 2019) to
enhancing its security measures to protect its information technology infrastructure. Disruptions of the Group’s
information technology infrastructure could result, among others, in a disruption of business operations and loss
of service to customers, and any such cyber-attack or security breach could result in significant costs to the Group
or harm its ability to successfully compete in one or more of its businesses, including reputational damage. Any

A44408936

## 19


-----

of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows.

### Risks related to the financial information incorporated by reference in this Base Prospectus and other financial risks

 The Group is subject to risks related to its indebtedness, including interest rate risk

The Group’s present indebtedness, which has increased significantly in recent years as the Group has expanded
its business, or future indebtedness could have significant negative consequences on its business, prospects,
results of operations, financial condition, corporate rating and cash flows, including:

  - placing the Group at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors
that may have better access to capital resources, including with respect to acquisitions and forcing the
Group to forego certain business opportunities;

  - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to service Group debt,
thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes, including, among others, capital
expenditures and dividends;

  - requiring the Group to issue equity or other securities or to sell some of its core assets, possibly not on
the best terms, to meet payment obligations;

  - accepting financial covenants in the Group’s financing contracts such as limitations on the incurrence of
debt, restrictions in the amount and nature of the Group’s investments or the obligation to pledge certain
Group’s assets;

  - a potential downgrade from a rating agency, which can make obtaining new financing more difficult and
expensive; and

  - requiring the Group to early repay the outstanding debt in the event that the relevant change of control
clause is triggered.

The Group is exposed to interest rate risk through its current and non-current borrowings. Borrowings issued at
floating rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, while fixed-rate borrowings expose the Group to
fair value interest rate risk.

As of the date of this Base Prospectus, according to the Group’s internal records, the Group’s fixed rate debt
amounted to €11,937,024 thousand, representing 86% of its gross financial debt excluding lease liabilities
(€13,821,966 thousand), whereas the Group’s variable rate debt amounted to €1,884,941 thousand, representing
14% of its gross financial debt excluding lease liabilities. As of 31 December 2020, the Group’s fixed rate debt
amounted to €7,566,413 thousand, representing 81% of its gross financial debt excluding lease liabilities
(€9,389,445 thousand), whereas the Group’s variable rate debt amounted to €1,823,032 thousand, representing
19% of its gross financial debt excluding lease liabilities. As of 31 December 2020, non-current lease liabilities
amounted to €1,478,759 thousand and current lease liabilities amounted to €284,060 thousand. As of 31
December 2019, restated, the Group’s fixed rate debt amounted to €3,497,050 thousand representing 68% of its
gross financial debt excluding lease liabilities (€5,137,574 thousand), whereas the Group’s variable rate debt
amounted to €1,640,524 thousand representing 32% of its gross financial debt excluding lease liabilities. As of
31 December 2019, restated, non-current lease liabilities amounted to €933,335 thousand and current lease
liabilities amounted to €206,853 thousand.

As of the date of this Base Prospectus, the Group’s weighted average cost of debt (considering both drawn and
undrawn borrowings) was 1.4% and the weighted average cost of debt (considering only drawn down borrowings)
was 1.6%. As of 31 December 2020, the Group’s weighted average cost of debt (considering both drawn and

A44408936

## 20


-----

undrawn borrowings) was 1.1% (1.5% as of 31 December 2019, restated) and the weighted average cost of debt
(considering only drawn down borrowings) was 1.6% (1.7% as of 31 December 2019, restated).

Any increase in interest rates would increase the Group’s finance costs relating to its variable-rate indebtedness
and increase the costs of refinancing its existing indebtedness and issuing new debt, which could adversely affect
the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

As of the date of this Base Prospectus, the estimated sensitivity in the Group’s financial costs to a 1% change
(increase or decrease) in the interest rate, both fixed and variable, is as follows. The amount of the Group’s
financial costs from fixed gross financial debt excluding lease liabilities would remain unchanged. The amount
of the Group’s financial costs from variable gross financial debt excluding lease liabilities would increase by
€18,849 thousand in the event of a 1% interest rate increase and the amount of the Group’s financial costs from
variable gross financial debt excluding lease liabilities would decrease by €2,099 thousand in the event of a 1%
interest rate decrease, as some of the Group’s financing contracts include a EURIBOR/LIBOR floor.

### The historical consolidated financial information only takes into account the transactions completed as of each reporting period

The Group has undertaken various significant transactions throughout the years 2019 and 2020 and until 30 June
2021, and has also entered into other material agreements.

In particular, between 31 December 2020 and the date of this Base Prospectus, the Group completed the CK
Hutchison Holdings Transaction in respect of Sweden, the Iliad Poland Acquisition, the T-Mobile Infra
Acquisition, the CK Hutchison Holdings Transaction in respect of Italy and the Polkomtel Acquisition (all as
defined herein), the latter not being accounted for in the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial
statements of the Guarantor in respect of the six-month period ended 30 June 2021. Also, both before and after
31 December 2020, the Group has entered into certain transactions which are still pending completion as of the
date of this Base Prospectus, such as the CK Hutchison Holdings Transaction in respect of the United Kingdom
and the Hivory Acquisition. In accordance with IFRS 3, transactions will be accounted for as of their respective
dates of completion, such that the corresponding impact of each transaction is included in the Group’s
consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the reporting period in which it is completed. (See “Description of the
_Guarantor” for additional information on the transactions that were completed after 31 December 2020 and those_
still pending completion as of the date of this Base Prospectus).

The Group regularly enters into transactions to acquire additional infrastructures, which are structured as asset
acquisitions or share purchases, as the case may be, and undertakes build-to-suit programs. Acquisitions are
consolidated within the Group as of their respective dates of completion, such that, the corresponding impact of
the operations of such acquisitions is reflected in the Group’s consolidated income statement from their respective
dates of completion and the value of acquisitions is included in the Group’s consolidated balance sheet as of the
end of the reporting period in which they were or are completed, as applicable. Limited or no historical financial
information (audited or unaudited) is typically available for the acquired assets or business units prior to their
date of incorporation into the Group.

As the Group regularly enters into these types of transactions and programs, it is difficult to compare the Group’s
historical and future infrastructure perimeter year-to-year on a like-for-like basis. Furthermore, as a result of these
transactions and programs the financial condition and results of operations as of and for the financial periods
discussed in this Base Prospectus are not fully comparable, may not be fully comparable with the Group’s
financial statements for future periods, and may not be indicative of the Group’s current and future business,
financial condition or results of operations.

### The Group is subject to foreign currency risks

As the Group’s reporting currency is the euro, fluctuations in the value of other currencies in which borrowings
are instrumented and transactions are carried out with respect to the euro may have an effect on future commercial
transactions, recognized assets and liabilities, and net investments in foreign operations.

Furthermore, the Group operates and holds assets in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden and
Poland, all of which are outside the Eurozone. It is therefore exposed to foreign currency risks and in particular
to the risk of currency fluctuation in connection with exchange rate between the euro, on the one hand, and the
pound sterling, the Swiss franc, the Danish krone, the Swedish krona and the Polish zloty, respectively, on the
other. The Group’s strategy for hedging foreign currency risk in investments in non-euro currencies does not
necessarily attempt to fully hedge this risk and tends towards a balanced hedge of this risk. In fact, the Group is
open to assessing different hedging strategies, including allowing the Group to have significant positions not
covered. These different hedging strategies might be implemented over a reasonable period depending on the
market and the prior assessment of the effect of the hedge. Hedging arrangements can be instrumented via
derivatives or borrowings in local currency, which act as a natural hedge.

The majority of the Group’s transactions are denominated in euro. However, as of 31 December 2020 the
contributions to the Group’s income in a functional currency other than the euro amounted to €278,806 thousand
(18% of the Group’s operating income) (€98,528 thousand representing 9% of the Group’s operating income as
of 31 December 2019, restated). As of 31 December 2020, the contributions to the Group’s total assets in a
functional currency other than the euro amounted to €6,140,854 thousand (25% of the Group’s total assets)
(€2,191,501 thousand representing 17% of the Group’s total assets as of 31 December 2019, restated). The
volatility in the exchange rate between the euro, and, respectively, the pound sterling, the Swiss franc, the Danish
krone, the Swedish krona and the Polish zloty may have negative consequences on the Group, affecting its overall
performance, business, results in operations, financial condition and cash flows.

As of 31 December 2020, the estimated sensitivity of the consolidated operating income and of the consolidated
equity to a 10% change (increase) in the exchange rate of the main currencies in which the Group operated with
regard to the rate in effect as of 31 December 2020 was as follows:

**+ 10%**

**Operating Income** **Equity[(1)]**
**Functional currency**

**(in thousands of €)**

GBP .................................................................................................................... (13,122) (166,077)

CHF .................................................................................................................... (12,497) (69,846)

DKK....................................................................................................................     - (31,711)

(1) Impact on equity from translation differences arising in the consolidation process.

### Changes to tax rates or other provisions of the tax law may adversely affect the value of the Group’s deferred tax assets and liabilities

The Group has significant deferred tax liabilities (amounting to €1,790,830 thousand as of 31 December 2020
and €881,764 thousand as of 31 December 2019, restated) and deferred tax assets (amounting to €464,531
thousand as of 31 December 2020 and €133,723 thousand as of 31 December 2019, restated). Changes to tax
rates or other provisions of applicable tax laws (for example, the deductibility of items) which may be enacted in
the regions where the Group operates, or to their interpretation, may affect the timing, valuation or realisation of
future deferred tax liabilities or assets. In particular, an increase in tax rates or the elimination of certain
deductions could increase the expected future cost of existing deferred tax liabilities, which could have a material
adverse effect on the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In

A44408936

this regard, the Spanish government has approved limitations on the Spanish participation exemption in
connection with dividends and capital gains under specific conditions. These measures could lead to increases in
the Guarantor’s and the Group’s Spanish effective corporate income tax rate.

In addition to the abovementioned risks, the Group is also exposed to the risk of changes to existing or new tax
laws or international tax treaties, methodologies impacting the Group’s international operations, or fees directed
specifically at the ownership and operation of communications infrastructures or the Group’s international
acquisitions, which may be applied or enforced retroactively; as well as to the new interpretation of such
regulations in a more adverse manner for the Group, especially with regards to the tax treatment of certain
environmental or real estate-related taxable events, or tax regulations. Changes to how such laws, treaties,
methodologies and fees are interpreted or applied, including adjustments to the interpretation of transfer pricing
standards; laws or regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise
limit distributions of capital and changes thereto; increases in the cost of labour (as a result of increases in social
security charges or otherwise), and taxes and other charges applicable to power and other goods and services
required for its operations; and price setting or other similar laws for the sharing of active and passive
infrastructure. The occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s
business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

### Risk related to the Guarantor’s ownership structure

 The Guarantor’s significant shareholders’ interests may differ from those of the Group

As of the date of this Base Prospectus, there are two significant shareholders of the Guarantor represented in the
Board of Directors with one director each: (i) Edizione S.R.L (“Edizione”), which pursuant to publicly available
information on the website of the Spanish Securities Market Commission (the “CNMV”) indirectly holds
approximately 8.532% of Cellnex’s share capital; and (ii) GIC Private Limited (“GIC”), which pursuant to
publicly available information on the website of the CNMV directly and indirectly holds approximately 6.989%
of Cellnex’s share capital. Pursuant to publicly available information on the website of the CNMV, there are other
significant shareholders with stakes above 3% of the share capital.

The Guarantor’s principal significant shareholders may have an influence over those matters requiring
shareholders’ approval, including the appointment and dismissal of the members of the Board of Directors, the
payment of dividends, changes in the issued share capital of the Guarantor and the adoption of certain
amendments to the bylaws. There can be no assurance that any current or future significant shareholder will act
in a manner that is in the best interest of the Group, which could, in turn, adversely affect the Group’s business,
prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

### Risks Relating to the Notes

 The Notes may be redeemed by the Issuer prior to maturity

Notes may be redeemable prior to maturity at the Issuer’s option in certain circumstances, and an optional
redemption feature of Notes is likely to limit their market value. During any period when the Issuer may elect to
redeem Notes, the market value of those Notes generally will not rise substantially above the price at which they
can be redeemed. This also may be true prior to any redemption period. The Issuer may be expected to redeem
Notes when their cost of borrowing is lower than the interest rate on the Notes. At those times, an investor
generally would not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest
rate as high as the interest rate on the Notes being redeemed and may only be able to do so at a significantly
lower rate. Potential investors should consider reinvestment risk in light of other investments available at that
time.

### The value of and return on any Notes linked to a benchmark may be adversely affected by ongoing national and international regulatory reform in relation to benchmarks or future discontinuance of benchmarks 

LIBOR, EURIBOR, SONIA and other interest rate or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be
“benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory discussions and proposals for
reform. Some of these reforms are already effective whilst others are still to be implemented. The Benchmark
Regulation was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 29 June 2016 and has applied from 1
January 2018 (with the exception of provisions specified in Article 59 (mainly on critical benchmarks) that have
applied since 30 June 2016). The Benchmark Regulation could have a material impact on any Notes linked to
LIBOR, EURIBOR or another “benchmark” rate or index, in particular, if the methodology or other terms of the
“benchmark” are changed in order to comply with the terms of the Benchmark Regulation, and such changes
could (amongst other things) have the effect of reducing or increasing the rate or level, or affecting the volatility
of the published rate or level, of the benchmark. In addition, the Benchmark Regulation stipulates that each
administrator of a “benchmark” regulated thereunder must be licensed by the competent authority of the Member
State where such administrator is located. There is a risk that administrators of certain “benchmarks” will fail to
obtain a necessary licence, preventing them from continuing to provide such “benchmarks”. Other administrators
may cease to administer certain “benchmarks” because of the additional costs of compliance with the Benchmark
Regulation and other applicable regulations, and the risks associated therewith. There is also a risk that certain
benchmarks may continue to be administered but may in time become obsolete.

### Risks relating to the proposed discontinuation of LIBOR and other benchmarks

On 27 July 2017, the Chief Executive of the UK Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates the
LIBOR, announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of
the LIBOR benchmark after 2021. On 5 March 2021, the FCA announced the future cessation or loss of
representativeness of the LIBOR benchmark settings currently published by ICE. Pursuant to the latest FCA
announcement, publication of (i) all euro LIBOR and Swiss franc LIBOR settings, the spot next, 1-week, 2month and 12-month Japanese yen LIBOR settings, the overnight, 1-week, 2-month and 12-month sterling
LIBOR settings, and the 1-week and 2-month US dollar LIBOR settings will cease immediately after 31
December 2021 and (ii) the overnight and 12-month US dollar LIBOR settings will cease immediately after 30
June 2023. In relation to the remaining LIBOR settings (that is, the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month sterling, US
dollar and Japanese yen LIBOR settings), the FCA will consult or continue to consider the case for using its
proposed powers to require ICE to continue publishing these settings on a ‘synthetic’ basis, though publication
of the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month Japanese yen LIBOR settings would cease permanently at the end of 2022.
Nevertheless, the FCA confirmed that, even if it does require ICE to continue publishing any of these nine
remaining LIBOR settings on a ‘synthetic’ basis, such settings will no longer be representative of the underlying
market and the economic reality that such settings are intended to measure and representativeness will not be
restored. Therefore, after 31 December 2021 (or 30 June 2023 in relation to the overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6month and 12-month US dollar LIBOR settings) all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any
administrator or no longer be representative.

On 21 September 2017, the European Central Bank announced that it would be part of a new working group
tasked with the identification and adoption of a “risk free overnight rate” which can serve as a basis for an
alternative to current benchmarks used in a variety of financial instruments and contracts in the euro area.

Following the implementation of any such potential reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may
change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or the benchmark could be eliminated
entirely, or there could be other consequences that cannot be predicted. The elimination of the LIBOR benchmark
or any other benchmark, or changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, could require or result in
an adjustment to the interest calculation provisions of the Conditions (as further described in Condition 7(j)

A44408936

## 24


-----

(Benchmark Discontinuation)), or result in adverse consequences to holders of any Notes linked to such
benchmark (including Floating Rate Notes whose interest rates are linked to LIBOR, EURIBOR, SONIA or any
other such benchmark that is subject to reform). Furthermore, even prior to the implementation of any changes,
uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes to such benchmark may
adversely affect such benchmark during the term of the relevant Notes, the return on the relevant Notes and the
trading market for securities (including the Notes) based on the same benchmark.

The Conditions set out below provide for certain fallback arrangements in the event that a published benchmark,
such as LIBOR, (including any page on which such benchmark may be published (or any successor service))
becomes unavailable, including the possibility that the rate of interest could be set by reference to a successor
rate or an alternative rate and that such successor rate or alternative reference rate may be adjusted (if required).
Furthermore, if a successor rate or alternative rate for the original rate of interest is determined, the Issuer may
vary the Conditions, as necessary to ensure the proper operation of such successor rate or alternative rate, without
any requirement for consent or approval of the Noteholders. In certain circumstances the ultimate fallback of
interest for a particular Interest Period may result in the rate of interest for the last preceding Interest Period being
used. This may result in the effective application of a fixed rate for Floating Rate Notes based on the rate which
was last observed on the Relevant Screen Page. In addition, due to the uncertainty concerning the availability of
successor rates and alternative reference rates and the involvement of an Independent Adviser, the relevant
fallback provisions may not operate as intended at the relevant time.

Any such consequences could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any such Notes.
Investors should consult their own independent advisers and make their own assessment about the potential risks
imposed by the Benchmark Regulation reforms in making any investment decision with respect to any Notes
linked to or referencing a benchmark.

### The market continues to develop in relation to risk-free rates (including SONIA) as reference rates for floating rate Notes

_Nascent risk-free rates and market_

Investors should be aware that the market continues to develop in relation to risk-free rates, such as SONIA, as
reference rates in the capital markets for sterling bonds, as applicable, and their adoption as alternatives to the
relevant interbank offered rates. SONIA has been recently reformed and other risk-free rates are newly
established. Therefore, SONIA (as reformed) and other risk-free rates have a limited performance history and the
future performance of such risk-free rates is impossible to predict. As a consequence, no future performance of
the relevant risk-free rate or Notes referencing such risk-free rate may be inferred from any of the hypothetical
or actual historical performance data.

_Calculation of Interest_

Where the relevant Final Terms for a Series of Floating Rate Notes identifies that the Rate of Interest for such
Notes will be determined by reference to SONIA the Rate of Interest will be determined by reference to
Compounded Daily SONIA, the Compounded Daily SONIA Index or Weighted Average SONIA. In each case
such rate will differ from the relevant LIBOR rate in a number of material respects, including (without limitation)
that a compounded daily rate or weighted average rate is a backwards-looking, risk-free overnight rate, and a
single daily rate is a risk-free overnight non-term rate, whereas LIBOR is expressed on the basis of a forwardlooking term and include a risk-element based on inter-bank lending. As such, investors should be aware that
LIBOR and SONIA may behave materially differently as interest reference rates for Notes issued under the
Programme.

In addition, market participants and relevant working groups are exploring alternative reference rates based on
risk-free rates, including term SONIA reference rates (which seek to measure the market’s forward expectation

A44408936

## 25


-----

of an average SONIA rate over a designated term). The development of SONIA as an interest reference rate for
the Eurobond markets, as well as continued development of SONIA based rates for such market and the market
infrastructure for adopting such rates, could result in reduced liquidity or increased volatility or could otherwise
affect the market price of the Notes.

Interest on Notes which reference a risk-free rate is only capable of being determined immediately prior to the
relevant Interest Payment Date. It may be difficult for investors in Notes which reference risk-free rates to reliably
estimate the amount of interest which will be payable on such Notes. Further, if the Notes become due and
payable under Condition 12 or are otherwise redeemed early on a date which is not an Interest Payment Date, the
Rate of Interest payable shall be determined on the date the Notes became due and payable and shall not be reset
thereafter.

Each risk-free rate is published and calculated by third parties based on data received from other sources and the
Issuer has no control over their respective determinations, calculations or publications. There can be no guarantee
that the relevant risk-free rate will not be discontinued or fundamentally altered in a manner that is materially
adverse to the interests of investors in Notes linked to or which reference a such risk-free rate (or that any
applicable benchmark fallback provisions provided for in the Conditions will provide a rate which is
economically equivalent for Noteholders). The Bank of England, as administrator of SONIA, does not have an
obligation to consider the interests of Noteholders in calculating, adjusting, converting, revising or discontinuing
the relevant risk-free rate. If the manner in which the relevant risk-free rate is calculated is changed, that change
may result in a reduction of the amount of interest payable on such Notes and the trading prices of such Notes.

To the extent the SONIA rate is not published, the applicable rate to be used to calculate the Interest Rate on
Notes referencing SONIA will be determined using the fallback provisions set out in the Conditions which apply
specifically to Notes referencing SONIA and are distinct to those applying to other types of Notes. Any of these
fallback provisions may result in interest payments that are lower than, or do not otherwise correlate over time
with, the payments that would have been made on the Notes if the relevant SONIA rate had been so published in
its current form.

_Market Adoption_

The market or a significant part thereof may adopt an application of SONIA that differs significantly from that
set out in the Conditions as applicable to the Notes. Furthermore, the Issuer may, in future, issue Notes referencing
SONIA that differ materially in terms of interest determination when compared with the Notes already issued. In
addition, the manner of adoption or application of SONIA reference rates in the Eurobond markets may differ
materially compared with the application and adoption of SONIA in other markets, such as the derivatives and
loan markets. Investors should carefully consider how any mismatch between the adoption of SONIA reference
rates across these markets may impact any hedging or other financial arrangements which they may put in place
in connection with any acquisition, holding or disposal of Notes referencing any such rate.

### Meetings of Noteholders: Modification and waiver

The Agency Agreement contains provisions for calling meetings of Noteholders to consider matters relating to
the Notes, including the modification of any provision of the Conditions. Such modification may be a reduction
in the amount of principal or interest payable on any date in respect of the Notes or to alter the method of
calculating the amount of any payment in respect of the Notes on redemption or maturity or to effect the exchange
or substitution of the Notes for, or the conversion of the Notes into, shares, bonds or other obligations or securities
of the Issuer or any other person or body corporate formed or to be formed. These provisions permit defined
majorities to bind all Noteholders including Noteholders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and
Noteholders who voted in a manner contrary to such resolutions.

A44408936

## 26


-----

As a result of the above, actions may be taken with respect to a Series of Notes with which some Noteholders of
such Notes may not agree or which may economically prejudice such Noteholders.

### Risks related to the Spanish withholding tax regime

The Issuer considers that, pursuant to the provisions of the Law 10/2014 and Royal Decree 1065/2007, as
amended, it is not obliged to withhold taxes in Spain on any interest paid on the Notes to any Noteholder,
irrespective of whether such Noteholder is tax resident in Spain. The foregoing is subject to compliance with
certain information procedures described in “Taxation—Taxation in Spain—Information about the Notes in
_connection with Payments” below._

The Issuer and the Fiscal Agent will, to the extent applicable, comply with the relevant procedures to facilitate
the collection of information concerning the Notes. The procedures may be modified, amended or supplemented
to, among other reasons, reflect a change in applicable Spanish law, regulation, ruling or interpretation thereof.
Under Royal Decree 1065/2007, the Issuer may make payments free of Spanish withholding tax, provided that
the Notes comply, among others, with the following requirements: (i) the Notes are regarded as listed debt
securities issued under Law 10/2014; and (ii) they are initially registered at a foreign clearing and settlement
entity that is recognised under Spanish regulations or under those of another OECD member state. The Issuer
expects that the Notes will meet the requirements referred to in (i) and (ii) above and that, consequently, payments
made by the Issuer to Noteholders should be paid free of Spanish withholding tax, provided that the procedural
requirements referred to above are complied with. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Fiscal Agent fails to
submit to the Issuer the relevant information in a timely manner, the Issuer will withhold tax at the then-applicable
rate (as of the date of this Base Prospectus, 19%) from any payment in respect of the relevant Notes. The Issuer
will not pay any additional amounts with respect to any such withholding arising as a result of any failure or
inability to comply with the relevant procedural requirements.

Investors who are not resident in Spain for tax purposes and are entitled to exemption from Non-Resident Income
Tax on income derived from the Notes, but where the Issuer does not timely receive the information above about
the Notes by means of a certificate the form of which is attached as Annex I of this Base Prospectus, would have
to apply directly to the Spanish tax authorities for any refund to which they may be entitled, according to the
procedures set forth in the Spanish Non Resident Income Tax Law.

If the Spanish Tax Authorities maintain a different opinion as to the application by the Issuer or the Guarantor of
withholding to payments made to Spanish tax residents (individuals and entities subject to Corporate Income Tax
(Impuesto sobre Sociedades)), the Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be, will be bound by the opinion and,
with immediate effect, will make the appropriate withholding. If this is the case, identification of Noteholders
may be required and the procedures, if any, for the collection of relevant information will be applied by the Issuer
(to the extent required) so that it can comply with its obligations under the applicable legislation as interpreted
by the Spanish Tax Authorities. If procedures for the collection of the Noteholders information are to apply, the
Noteholders will be informed of such new procedures and their implications.

Notwithstanding the above, in the case of Notes held by Spanish tax resident individuals (and, under certain
circumstances, by Spanish entities subject to Corporate Income Tax) and deposited with a Spanish resident entity
acting as depositary or custodian, payments in respect of such Notes may be subject to withholding by such
depositary or custodian (currently 19%).

### Risks related to the Spanish Insolvency Law

The Spanish Insolvency Law regulates court insolvency proceedings and may lead either to the restructuring of
the debt of the Issuer or to the liquidation of its assets, as well as restructuring schemes out of insolvency.

Under the Spanish Insolvency Law, the claims of creditors are classified as credits against the estate (créditos
_contra la masa), general and special privileged credits (créditos privilegiados generales y especiales), ordinary_

A44408936

## 27


-----

credits (créditos ordinarios) or subordinated credits (créditos subordinados). Upon insolvency of an entity under
the Spanish Insolvency Law, ordinary creditors rank ahead of subordinated creditors but behind privileged
creditors and creditors with claims against the estate. The Issuer expects that claims under the Notes respectively
would be classified as ordinary credits against the Issuer. However, certain actions or circumstances that are
beyond the control of the Issuer may result in these claims being classified as subordinated credits. For example,
under Article 281.1.5º of the Spanish Insolvency Law, the claims of persons that are especially related to the
Issuer will be classified as subordinated credits (except in those cases established under Article 281.2 of the
Spanish Insolvency Law).

The following persons may be considered especially related to the Issuer:

(a) shareholders holding, directly or indirectly, (i) 5% or more of the Issuer’s share capital at the moment in
which the credit right arises, if the Issuer is a listed company; or (ii) 10% or more of the Issuer’s capital at
the moment in which the credit arises, if the Issuer is not a listed company. In the event the shareholder is
a natural person, those persons who are specially related to him as provided in the Spanish Insolvency
Law are also deemed as persons specially related to the Issuer;

(b) actual or shadow directors and general attorneys (including those who acted as such in the two years
leading up to the declaration of insolvency); and

(c) members of the same group of companies as the Issuer and their common shareholders (i.e., those who
hold a stake in the borrower in insolvency, as well as any group company, complying with the requirements
established in Article 283.1.4º of the Spanish Insolvency Law).

Furthermore, any person who acquires credits that were held by one of the persons mentioned above is also
presumed to be especially related to the relevant entity if the acquisition takes place in the two years leading up
to the declaration of insolvency. This presumption is rebuttable.

The claims of Noteholders may, therefore, to the extent they are considered especially related to the Issuer, be
subordinated as a result of the application of the provisions of the Spanish Insolvency Law. Noteholders should
be aware of this subordination risk and take those precautions they consider appropriate to ensure that their claims
are not subordinated.

The Spanish Insolvency Law includes pre-insolvency instruments, refinancing agreements (“acuerdos de
_refinanciación”) and arrangements (“convenios”), being their key features:_

(a) No enforcement of security in pre-insolvency scenarios under Articles 583 et seq. of the Spanish
Insolvency Law: Spanish Insolvency Law already included a notification system for companies in
imminent or actual insolvency, when negotiations with creditors had been started for the purposes of
agreeing a refinancing agreement (as defined in the Spanish Insolvency Law) or an advanced composition
agreement to be filed within the insolvency procedure, which suspended the obligation of the insolvent
company to file for insolvency in a period of three months, and prevented creditors from filing for its
insolvency. Once this three-month term elapses, the company must file for insolvency within the next
month if the state of insolvency persists (although a moratorium until 31 December 2021 has been
established by regulations in connection with the Coronavirus Pandemic). Once the abovementioned
notification under Articles 583 et seq. is made, secured creditors can enforce their security but such
enforcement will be automatically suspended for three months in the event the secured assets affected by
such enforcement are needed for the continuity of the business activity of the debtor.

(b) Protected refinancing agreements: The protected refinancing agreements provide a “safe harbour” for
restructuring processes, so the claw-back period does not affect them and the transactions carried out under
these refinancing agreements are not subject to scrutiny and potential revocation when the company

A44408936

## 28


-----

becomes insolvent, unless certain circumstances set forth in Articles 697 to 699 of Spanish Insolvency
Law apply.

(c) Spanish “schemes of arrangement”: in addition to the protection against claw-back as described in (b)
above, the Spanish Insolvency Law allows the cram down of dissenting creditors holding financial claims
against the borrowers (including secured creditors) within refinancing agreements when meeting certain
requirements, mainly regarding majority thresholds.

The Spanish Insolvency Law also provides, among other things, that: (i) any claim may become subordinated if
it is not reported to the insolvency administrator (administrador concursal) within one month from the last official
publication of the court order declaring the insolvency in the Spanish Official Gazette (Boletín Oficial del
_Estado), although some exceptions may apply (ii) acts deemed detrimental for the insolvency estate of the_
insolvent debtor carried out during the two-year period preceding the date of its declaration of insolvency may
be rescinded, even if no fraud nor link to the insolvency exist (some legal presumptions of “detrimental acts”,
rebuttable and non-rebuttable, are established in the Spanish Insolvency Law), (iii) provisions in a contract
granting one party the right to terminate by reason only of the other party’s declaration of insolvency are not
enforceable, and (iv) accrual of interest (other than non-moratorium interests accruing under secured liabilities
up to an amount equal to the value of the asset subject to the security) shall be suspended as from the date of the
declaration of insolvency and any amount of interest accrued up to such date and unpaid (other than any interest
accruing under secured liabilities up to an amount equal to the value of the asset subject to the security) shall
become subordinated.

### The right to receive payments on the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of the Group’s existing and future secured creditors to the extent of the value of the asset subject to the security and structurally subordinated to claims against the Group’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes

The Notes issued under the Programme will be general unsecured obligations of the Issuer and will not be
guaranteed by any subsidiary of the Issuer or of the Guarantor. Obligees of the Guarantor’s or the Issuer’s secured
obligations, if any, will have claims that are prior to the claims of the Noteholders to the extent of the value of
the asset securing those other obligations. In the event of any distribution of assets or payment in any foreclosure,
dissolution, winding up, liquidation, reorganisation, or other bankruptcy proceeding of the Issuer or the
Guarantor, the assets securing the claims of secured creditors will be used to satisfy the claims of those creditors,
if any, before they are available to unsecured creditors, including the Noteholders. In any of the foregoing events,
there is no assurance to Noteholders that there will be sufficient assets to pay amounts due under the Notes.

None of the Guarantor’s subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes, which means that the Noteholders will have no
direct claims against the assets or the earnings of the Guarantor’s subsidiaries to satisfy obligations due under the
Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risk Factors relating to the Issuer—The ability of the Issuer to meet its obligations
_under the Notes will depend upon Cellnex and other companies within the Group meeting their corresponding_
_obligations with the Issuer in a timely manner”. Generally, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, the_
Guarantor’s subsidiaries, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their
claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to any direct or
indirect shareholder of any such subsidiary, including the Guarantor. Accordingly, in the event that any of the
Guarantor’s subsidiaries becomes insolvent, liquidates or otherwise restructures its liabilities: (i) the creditors of
the Issuer and the Guarantor (including the Noteholders) will have no right to proceed against such subsidiary’s
assets; and (ii) creditors of such subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in full
from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before any direct or indirect shareholder, including
the Guarantor, is entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary. As such, the Notes will be structurally
subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and any preferred shareholders of the Guarantor’s
subsidiaries.

### Risks Relating to the Market generally

 The Issue Price may be greater than the market value of the Notes

The Issue Price specified in the relevant Final Terms may be higher than the market value of the Notes as at the
Issue Date, and the price, if any, at which a Dealer or any other person is willing to purchase the Notes in
secondary market transactions could be lower than the Issue Price. In particular, the Issue Price may take into
account amounts with respect to commissions relating to the issue and sale of the Notes as well as amounts
relating to the hedging of the Issuer's obligations under the Notes, and secondary market prices are likely to
exclude such amounts. In addition, whilst the proprietary pricing models of Dealers are often based on well
recognised financial principles, other market participants' pricing models may differ or produce a different result.

### There is no active trading market for the Notes

Notes issued under the Programme will be new securities that may not be widely distributed and for which there
is currently no active trading market (unless in the case of any particular Tranche, such Tranche is to be
consolidated with and form a single series with a Tranche of Notes that is already issued). If the Notes are traded
after their initial issuance, they may trade at a discount to their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing
interest rates, the market for similar securities, general economic conditions and the financial condition of the
Issuer and the Guarantor. Although applications have been made for the Notes issued under the Programme to be
listed on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and admitted to trading on its regulated market, there is no assurance
that such applications will be accepted, that any particular Tranche of Notes will be so admitted or that an active
trading market will develop. Accordingly, there is no assurance as to the development or liquidity of any trading
market for any particular Tranche of Notes.

### Ratings of the Issuer, the Guarantor or of Notes could cause fluctuations in the price at which Notes are traded

Notes issued under the Programme are currently expected to be rated or unrated. However, the Issuer and the
Guarantor may in the future solicit a rating for itself and/or its debt (including one or more issues of Notes under
the Programme) from one or more credit rating agencies. Should any such assigned rating(s) be published, there
can be no assurances as to whether or not any such rating will be investment grade. The publication of any such
rating could lead to fluctuations in the price at which the Notes are traded in the secondary market, especially if
the rating is below investment grade.

### Exchange rate fluctuations may affect the value of the Notes

If an investor's financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or currency unit (the “Investor's
**Currency”) other than the unit of currency in which principal and interest on the Notes is paid (the “Payment**
**Currency”), this could present certain risk relating to currency conversions. These include the risk that exchange**
rates may significantly change (including changes due to devaluation of the Payment Currency or revaluation of
the Investor's Currency) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor's Currency may impose
or modify exchange controls. An appreciation in the value of the Investor's Currency relative to the Payment
Currency would decrease (i) the Investor's Currency-equivalent yield on the Notes, (ii) the Investor's Currencyequivalent value of the principal payable on the Notes, and (iii) the Investor's Currency equivalent market value
of the Notes.

Government and monetary authorities may impose exchange controls that could adversely affect an applicable
exchange rate. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than expected, or no interest or
principal. Any of the foregoing events could adversely affect the price of the Notes.

### Fixed/Floating Rate Notes

Fixed/Floating Rate Notes may bear interest at a rate that may convert from a fixed rate to a floating rate, or from
a floating rate to a fixed rate. Where the Issuer has the right to effect such a conversion, this will affect the
secondary market and the market value of the Notes since the Issuer may be expected to convert the rate when it
is likely to produce a lower overall cost of borrowing. If the Issuer converts from a fixed rate to a floating rate in
such circumstances, the spread on the Fixed/Floating Rate Notes may be less favourable than then prevailing
spreads on comparable Floating Rate Notes tied to the same reference rate. In addition, the new floating rate at
any time may be lower than the rates on other Notes. If the Issuer converts from a floating rate to a fixed rate in
such circumstances, the fixed rate may be lower than then prevailing rates on its Notes.

### FINAL TERMS AND DRAWDOWN PROSPECTUSES

In this section the expression “necessary information” means, in relation to any Tranche of Notes, the necessary
information which is material to an investor for making an informed assessment of the assets and liabilities,
financial position, profits and losses and prospects of the Issuer and the Guarantor and of the rights attaching to
the Notes. In relation to the different types of Notes which may be issued under the Programme the Issuer and
the Guarantor have included in this Base Prospectus all of the necessary information except for information
relating to the Notes which is not known at the date of this Base Prospectus and which can only be determined at
the time of an individual issue of a Tranche of Notes.

Any information relating to the Notes which is not included in this Base Prospectus and which is required in
order to complete the necessary information in relation to a Tranche of Notes will be contained either in the
relevant Final Terms or in a Drawdown Prospectus.

For a Tranche of Notes which is the subject of Final Terms, those Final Terms will, for the purposes of that
Tranche only, complete this Base Prospectus and must be read in conjunction with this Base Prospectus. The
terms and conditions applicable to any particular Tranche of Notes that is the subject of Final Terms are the
Conditions described in the relevant Final Terms as completed to the extent described in the relevant Final Terms.

The terms and conditions applicable to any particular Tranche of Notes which is the subject of a Drawdown
Prospectus will be the Conditions as amended and/or replaced to the extent described in the relevant Drawdown
Prospectus. In the case of a Tranche of Notes which is the subject of a Drawdown Prospectus, each reference in
this Base Prospectus to information being specified or identified in the relevant Final Terms shall be read and
construed as a reference to such information being specified or identified in the relevant Drawdown Prospectus
unless the context requires otherwise.

Each Drawdown Prospectus will be constituted by a single document containing the necessary information
relating to the Issuer, the Guarantor and the relevant Notes.

### FORMS OF THE NOTES

 Bearer Notes

Each Tranche of Notes in bearer form (“Bearer Notes”) will initially be in the form of either a temporary global
note in bearer form (the “Temporary Global Note”), without interest coupons, or a permanent global note in
bearer form (the “Permanent Global Note”), without interest coupons, in each case as specified in the relevant
Final Terms. Each Temporary Global Note or, as the case may be, Permanent Global Note (each a “Global Note”)
which is not intended to be issued in new global note (“NGN”) form, as specified in the relevant Final Terms,
will be deposited on or around the issue date of the relevant Tranche of the Notes with a depositary or a common
depositary for Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and/or Clearstream Banking, S.A. (“Clearstream,
**Luxembourg”) and/or any other relevant clearing system and each Global Note which is intended to be issued**
in NGN form, as specified in the relevant Final Terms, will be deposited on or around the issue date of the relevant
Tranche of the Notes with a common safekeeper for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg.

On 13 June 2006 the European Central Bank (the “ECB”) announced that Notes in NGN form are in compliance
with the “Standards for the use of EU securities settlement systems in ESCB credit operations” of the central
banking system for the euro (the “Eurosystem”), provided that certain other criteria are fulfilled. At the same
time the ECB also announced that arrangements for Notes in NGN form will be offered by Euroclear and
Clearstream, Luxembourg as of 30 June 2006 and that debt securities in global bearer form issued through
Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg after 31 December 2006 will only be eligible as collateral for
Eurosystem operations if the NGN form is used.

In the case of each Tranche of Bearer Notes, the relevant Final Terms will also specify whether U.S. Treasury
Regulation §1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(C) (or any successor rules in substantially the same form that are applicable for
purposes of Section 4701 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)) (the “TEFRA
**C Rules”) or U.S. Treasury Regulation §1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(D) (or any successor rules in substantially the same**
form that are applicable for purposes of Section 4701 of the Code) (the “TEFRA D Rules”) are applicable in
relation to the Notes or, if the Notes do not have a maturity of more than 365 days, that neither the TEFRA C
Rules nor the TEFRA D Rules are applicable.

### Temporary Global Note exchangeable for Permanent Global Notes

If the relevant Final Terms specifies the form of Notes as being “Temporary Global Note exchangeable for a
Permanent Global Note”, then the Notes will initially be in the form of a Temporary Global Note which will be
exchangeable, in whole or in part, for interests in a Permanent Global Note, without interest coupons, not earlier
than 40 days after the issue date of the relevant Tranche of the Notes upon certification as to non-U.S. beneficial
ownership. No payments will be made under the Temporary Global Note unless exchange for interests in the
Permanent Global Note is improperly withheld or refused. In addition, interest payments in respect of the Notes
cannot be collected without such certification of non-U.S. beneficial ownership.

Whenever any interest in the Temporary Global Note is to be exchanged for an interest in a Permanent Global
Note, the Issuer shall procure (in the case of first exchange) the delivery of a Permanent Global Note, duly
authenticated and, in the case of a NGN, effectuated, to the bearer of the Temporary Global Note or (in the case
of any subsequent exchange) an increase in the principal amount of the Permanent Global Note in accordance
with its terms against:

(i) presentation and (in the case of final exchange) presentation and surrender of the Temporary Global Note
to or to the order of the Fiscal Agent; and

(ii) receipt by the Fiscal Agent of a certificate or certificates of non-U.S. beneficial ownership.

A44408936

## 34


-----

The principal amount of Notes represented by the Permanent Global Note shall be equal to the aggregate of the
principal amounts specified in the certificates of non-U.S. beneficial ownership _provided, however, that in no_
circumstances shall the principal amount of Notes represented by the Permanent Global Note exceed the initial
principal amount of Notes represented by the Temporary Global Note.

If:

(a) the Permanent Global Note has not been delivered or the principal amount thereof increased by 5.00 p.m.
(London time) on the seventh day after the bearer of the Temporary Global Note has requested exchange
of an interest in the Temporary Global Note for an interest in a Permanent Global Note; or

(b) the Temporary Global Note (or any part thereof) has become due and payable in accordance with the
Conditions of the Notes or the date for final redemption of the Temporary Global Note has occurred and,
in either case, payment in full of the amount of principal falling due with all accrued interest thereon has
not been made to the bearer of the Temporary Global Note in accordance with the terms of the Temporary
Global Note on the due date for payment,

then the Temporary Global Note (including the obligation to deliver a Permanent Global Note) will become void
at 5.00 p.m. (London time) on such seventh day (in the case of (a) above) or at 5.00 p.m. (London time) on such
due date (in the case of (b) above) and the bearer of the Temporary Global Note will have no further rights
thereunder (but without prejudice to the rights which the bearer of the Temporary Global Note or others may
have under the Deed of Covenant).

### Permanent Global Note exchangeable for Definitive Notes

If the relevant Final Terms specifies the form of Notes as being “Permanent Global Note exchangeable for
Definitive Notes”, then the Notes will initially be in the form of a Permanent Global Note which will be
exchangeable in whole, but not in part, for Bearer Notes in definitive form (“Definitive Notes”):

(i) on the expiry of such period of notice as may be specified in the relevant Final Terms; or

(ii) at any time, if so specified in the relevant Final Terms; or

(iii) if the relevant Final Terms specifies “in the limited circumstances described in the Permanent Global
Note”, then if either of the following events occurs:

(a) Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg or any other relevant clearing system is closed for business
for a continuous period of 14 days (other than by reason of legal holidays) or announces an
intention permanently to cease business; or

(b) any of the circumstances described in Condition 12 (Events of Default) occurs.

Whenever the Permanent Global Note is to be exchanged for Definitive Notes, the Issuer shall procure the prompt
delivery (free of charge to the bearer) of such Definitive Notes, duly authenticated and with Coupons and Talons
attached (if so specified in the relevant Final Terms), in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal
amount of Notes represented by the Permanent Global Note to the bearer of the Permanent Global Note against
the surrender of the Permanent Global Note to or to the order of the Fiscal Agent within 30 days of the bearer
requesting such exchange.

If:

(a) Definitive Notes have not been duly delivered by 5.00 p.m. (London time) on the thirtieth day after the
bearer has requested exchange of the Permanent Global Note for Definitive Notes; or

(b) the Permanent Global Note was originally issued in exchange for part only of a Temporary Global Note
representing the Notes and such Temporary Global Note becomes void in accordance with its terms; or

A44408936

## 35


-----

(c) the Permanent Global Note (or any part thereof) has become due and payable in accordance with the
Conditions of the Notes or the date for final redemption of the Permanent Global Note has occurred and,
in either case, payment in full of the amount of principal falling due with all accrued interest thereon has
not been made to the bearer in accordance with the terms of the Permanent Global Note on the due date
for payment,

then the Permanent Global Note (including the obligation to deliver Definitive Notes) will become void at 5.00
p.m. (London time) on such thirtieth day (in the case of (a) above) or at 5.00 p.m. (London time) on the date on
which such Temporary Global Note becomes void (in the case of (b) above) or at 5.00 p.m. (London time) on
such due date (in the case of (c) above) and the bearer of the Permanent Global Note will have no further rights
thereunder (but without prejudice to the rights which the bearer of the Permanent Global Note or others may have
under the Deed of Covenant).

### Temporary Global Note exchangeable for Definitive Notes

If the relevant Final Terms specifies the form of Notes as being “Temporary Global Note exchangeable for
Definitive Notes” and also specifies that the TEFRA C Rules are applicable or that neither the TEFRA C Rules
or the TEFRA D Rules are applicable, then the Notes will initially be in the form of a Temporary Global Note
which will be exchangeable, in whole but not in part, for Definitive Notes not earlier than 40 days after the issue
date of the relevant Tranche of the Notes.

If the relevant Final Terms specifies the form of Notes as being “Temporary Global Note exchangeable for
Definitive Notes” and also specifies that the TEFRA D Rules are applicable, then the Notes will initially be in
the form of a Temporary Global Note which will be exchangeable, in whole or in part, for Definitive Notes not
earlier than 40 days after the issue date of the relevant Tranche of the Notes upon certification as to non-U.S.
beneficial ownership. Interest payments in respect of the Notes cannot be collected without such certification of
non-U.S. beneficial ownership.

Whenever the Temporary Global Note is to be exchanged for Definitive Notes, the Issuer shall procure the prompt
delivery (free of charge to the bearer) of such Definitive Notes, duly authenticated and with Coupons and Talons
attached (if so specified in the relevant Final Terms), in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal
amount of the Temporary Global Note to the bearer of the Temporary Global Note against the surrender of the
Temporary Global Note to or to the order of the Fiscal Agent within 30 days of the bearer requesting such
exchange.

If:

(a) Definitive Notes have not been duly delivered by 5.00 p.m. (London time) on the thirtieth day after the
bearer has requested exchange of the Temporary Global Note for Definitive Notes; or

(b) the Temporary Global Note (or any part thereof) has become due and payable in accordance with the
Conditions of the Notes or the date for final redemption of the Temporary Global Note has occurred and,
in either case, payment in full of the amount of principal falling due with all accrued interest thereon has
not been made to the bearer in accordance with the terms of the Temporary Global Note on the due date
for payment,

then the Temporary Global Note (including the obligation to deliver Definitive Notes) will become void at 5.00
p.m. (London time) on such thirtieth day (in the case of (a) above) or at 5.00 p.m. (London time) on such due
date (in the case of (b) above) and the bearer of the Temporary Global Note will have no further rights thereunder
(but without prejudice to the rights which the bearer of the Temporary Global Note or others may have under the
Deed of Covenant).

A44408936

### Rights under Deed of Covenant

Under the Deed of Covenant, persons shown in the records of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or
any other relevant clearing system as being entitled to an interest in a Temporary Global Note or a Permanent
Global Note which becomes void will acquire directly against the Issuer all those rights to which they would
have been entitled if, immediately before the Temporary Global Note or Permanent Global Note became void,
they had been the holders of Definitive Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of
Notes they were shown as holding in the records of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or any other
relevant clearing system.

### Terms and Conditions applicable to the Notes

The terms and conditions applicable to any Definitive Note will be endorsed on that Note and will consist of the
terms and conditions set out under “Terms and Conditions of the Notes” below and the provisions of the relevant
Final Terms which complete those terms and conditions.

The terms and conditions applicable to any Note in global form will differ from those terms and conditions which
would apply to the Note were it in definitive form to the extent described under “Summary of Provisions Relating
_to the Notes while in Global Form” below._

### Legend concerning U.S. persons

In the case of any Tranche of Bearer Notes having a maturity of more than 365 days, the Notes in global form,
the Notes in definitive form and any Coupons and Talons appertaining thereto will bear a legend to the following
effect:

_“Any United States person who holds this obligation will be subject to limitations under the United States_
_income tax laws, including the limitations provided in Sections 165(j) and 1287(a) of the Internal Revenue_
_Code.”_

### Registered Notes

Each Tranche of Notes in registered form (“Registered Notes”) will be represented by either:

(i) individual Note Certificates in registered form (“Individual Note Certificates”); or

(ii) one or more global note certificates (“Global Registered Note(s)”),

in each case as specified in the relevant Final Terms.

In a press release dated 22 October 2008, “Evolution of the custody arrangement for international debt securities
_and their eligibility in Eurosystem credit operations”, the ECB announced that it had assessed the new holding_
structure and custody arrangements for registered notes which the ICSDs had designed in cooperation with
market participants and that Notes to be held under the new structure (the “New Safekeeping Structure” or
“NSS”) would be in compliance with the “Standards for the use of EU securities settlement systems in ESCB
_credit operations” of the central banking system for the euro (the “Eurosystem”), subject to the conclusion of_
the necessary legal and contractual arrangements. The press release also stated that the new arrangements for
Notes to be held in NSS form will be offered by Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg as of 30 June 2010 and
that registered debt securities in global registered form issued through Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg
after 30 September 2010 will only be eligible as collateral in Eurosystem operations if the New Safekeeping
Structure is used.

Each Global Registered Note will either be: (a) in the case of a Note which is not to be held under the NSS,
registered in the name of a common depositary (or its nominee) for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg
and/or any other relevant clearing system and the relevant Global Registered Note will be deposited on or about
the issue date with the common depositary and will be exchangeable in accordance with its terms; or (b) in the

A44408936

## 37


-----

case of a Note to be held under the New Safekeeping Structure, be registered in the name of a common safekeeper
(or its nominee) for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or any other relevant clearing system and
the relevant Global Registered Note will be deposited on or about the issue date with the common safekeeper for
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and will be exchangeable for Individual Note Certificates in
accordance with its terms.

If the relevant Final Terms specifies the form of Notes as being “Individual Note Certificates”, then the Notes
will at all times be represented by Individual Note Certificates issued to each Noteholder in respect of their
respective holdings.

### Global Registered Note exchangeable for Individual Note Certificates

If the relevant Final Terms specifies the form of Notes as being “Global Registered Note exchangeable for
Individual Note Certificates”, then the Notes will initially be represented by one or more Global Registered Notes
each of which will be exchangeable in whole, but not in part, for Individual Note Certificates if the relevant Final
Terms specifies “in the limited circumstances described in the Global Registered Note”, then if either of the
following events occurs:

(a) Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg or any other relevant clearing system is closed for business for a
continuous period of 14 days (other than by reason of legal holidays) or announces an intention
permanently to cease business; or

(b) if any of the circumstances described in Condition 12 (Events of Default) occurs.

Whenever a Global Registered Note is to be exchanged for Individual Note Certificates, each person having an
interest in a Global Registered Note must provide the Registrar (through the relevant clearing system) with such
information as the Issuer and the Registrar may require to complete and deliver Individual Note Certificates
(including the name and address of each person in which the Notes represented by the Individual Note Certificates
are to be registered and the principal amount of each such person’s holding).

Whenever a Global Registered Note is to be exchanged for Individual Note Certificates, the Issuer shall procure
that Individual Note Certificates will be issued in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of
the Global Registered Note within 5 business days of the delivery, by or on behalf of the registered holder of the
Global Registered Note to the Registrar of such information as is required to complete and deliver such Individual
Note Certificates against the surrender of the Global Registered Note at the specified office of the Registrar.

Such exchange will be effected in accordance with the provisions of the Agency Agreement and the regulations
concerning the transfer and registration of Notes scheduled to the Agency Agreement and, in particular, shall be
effected without charge to any holder, but against such indemnity as the Registrar may require in respect of any
tax or other duty of whatsoever nature which may be levied or imposed in connection with such exchange.

If:

(a) Individual Note Certificates have not been delivered by 5.00 p.m. (London time) on the thirtieth day after
they are due to be issued and delivered in accordance with the terms of the Global Registered Note; or

(b) any of the Notes represented by a Global Registered Note (or any part of it) has become due and payable
in accordance with the Conditions of the Notes or the date for final redemption of the Notes has occurred
and, in either case, payment in full of the amount of principal falling due with all accrued interest thereon
has not been made to the holder of the Global Registered Note in accordance with the terms of the Global
Registered Note on the due date for payment,

then at 5.00 p.m. (London time) on such thirtieth day (in the case of (a) above) or at 5.00 p.m. (London time) on
such due date (in the case of (b) above) each Accountholder (as defined herein) shall acquire under the Deed of

A44408936

## 38


-----

Covenant rights of enforcement against the Issuer (“Direct **Rights”) to compel the Issuer to perform its**
obligations to the Holder of the Global Registered Note in respect of the Notes represented by the Global
Registered Note, including the obligation of the Issuer to make all payments when due at any time in respect of
such Notes in accordance with the Conditions as if such Notes had (where required by the Conditions) been duly
presented and surrendered on the due date in accordance with the Conditions.

The Direct Rights shall be without prejudice to the rights which the Holder of the Global Registered Note may
have under the Global Registered Note or otherwise. Payment to the Holder of the Global Registered Note in
respect of any Notes represented by the Global Registered Note shall constitute a discharge of the Issuer’s
obligations under the Notes and the Deed of Covenant to the extent of any such payment and nothing in the Deed
of Covenant shall oblige the Issuer to make any payment under the Notes to or to the order of any person other
than the Holder of the Global Registered Note.

As a condition of any exercise of Direct Rights by an Accountholder, such Accountholder shall, as soon as
practicable, give notice of such exercise to the Noteholders in the manner provided for in the Conditions or the
Global Registered Note for notices to be given by the Issuer to Noteholders.

### Terms and Conditions applicable to the Notes

The terms and conditions applicable to any Individual Note Certificate will be endorsed on that Individual Note
Certificate and will consist of the terms and conditions set out under “Terms and Conditions of the Notes” below
and the provisions of the relevant Final Terms which complete those terms and conditions.

The terms and conditions applicable to any Global Registered Note will differ from those terms and conditions
which would apply to the Note were it in definitive form to the extent described under “Summary of Provisions
_Relating to the Notes while in Global Form” below._

### Summary of Provisions relating to the Notes while in Global Form

 Clearing System Accountholders

In relation to any Tranche of Notes represented by a Global Note, references in the Conditions of the Notes to
“Noteholder” are references to the bearer of the relevant Global Note which, for so long as the Global Note is
held by a depositary or a common depositary, in the case of a CGN, or a common safekeeper, in the case of a
NGN, for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or any other relevant clearing system, will be that
depositary or common depositary or, as the case may be, common safekeeper.

In relation to any Tranche of Notes represented by one or more Global Registered Notes, references in the
Conditions of the Notes to “Noteholder” are references to the person in whose name the relevant Global
Registered Note is for the time being registered in the Register which, for so long as the Global Registered Note
is held by or on behalf of a depositary or a common depositary or a common safekeeper for Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or any other relevant clearing system, will be that depositary or common
depositary or common safekeeper or a nominee for that depositary or common depositary or common safekeeper.

Each of the persons shown in the records of Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or any other relevant
clearing system as being entitled to an interest in a Global Note or a Global Registered Note (each an
“Accountholder”) must look solely to Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg and/or such other relevant clearing
system (as the case may be) for such Accountholder’s share of each payment made by the Issuer to the holder of
such Global Note or Global Registered Note and in relation to all other rights arising under such Global Note or
Global Registered Note. The extent to which, and the manner in which, Accountholders may exercise any rights
arising under a Global Note or Global Registered Note will be determined by the respective rules and procedures
of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg and any other relevant clearing system from time to time. For so long
as the relevant Notes are represented by a Global Note or Global Registered Note, Accountholders shall have no

A44408936

## 39


-----

claim directly against the Issuer in respect of payments due under the Notes and such obligations of the Issuer
will be discharged by payment to the holder of such Global Note or Global Registered Note.

### Conditions applicable to Global Notes and Global Registered Notes

Each Global Note and Global Registered Note will contain provisions which modify the Conditions of the Notes
as they apply to the Global Note or Global Registered Note. The following is a summary of certain of those
provisions:

_transfers and registration) below, a Registered Note may be transferred upon surrender of the relevant_
Note Certificate, with the endorsed form of transfer duly completed, at the Specified Office of the
Registrar or any Transfer Agent, together with such evidence as the Registrar or (as the case may be) such
Transfer Agent may reasonably require to prove the title of the transferor and the authority of the
individuals who have executed the form of transfer; provided, however, that a Registered Note may not
be transferred unless the principal amount of Registered Notes transferred and (where not all of the
Registered Notes held by a Holder are being transferred) the principal amount of the balance of Registered
Notes not transferred are in the Specified Denomination. Where not all the Registered Notes represented
by the surrendered Note Certificate are the subject of the transfer, a new Note Certificate in respect of the

to a person who is already a Holder of Registered Notes, a new Note Certificate representing the enlarged
holding shall only be issued upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of the Note Certificate representing the
existing holding.

(g) _Registration and delivery of Note Certificates:_ Within 5 business days of the surrender of a Note
Certificate in accordance with paragraph (f) (Transfers of Registered Notes) above, the Registrar will
register the transfer in question and deliver a new Note Certificate of a like principal amount to the

levied or imposed in connection with such transfer.

(i) _Closed periods: Noteholders may not require transfers to be registered during the period of 15 days ending_
on the due date for any payment of principal or interest in respect of the Registered Notes.

(j) _Regulations concerning transfers and registration:_ All transfers of Registered Notes and entries on the
Register are subject to the detailed regulations concerning the transfer of Registered Notes scheduled to
the Agency Agreement. The regulations may be changed by the Issuer with the prior written approval of
the Registrar. A copy of the current regulations will be mailed (free of charge) by the Registrar to any
Noteholder who requests in writing a copy of such regulations.

**4** **Status and Guarantee**

### (a) Status of Notes: The Notes constitute direct, general, unconditional and (subject to Condition 5 (Negative Pledge)) unsecured obligations of the Issuer and in the event of insolvency (concurso) of the Issuer (unless they qualify as subordinated debts under Article 281 of Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2020, de 5 de mayo, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley Concursal (the “Spanish Insolvency Law”) or equivalent legal provision which replaces it in the future and subject to any legal and statutory exceptions) will rank pari passu without any preference among themselves and

A44408936

## 53


-----

### with all other outstanding unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer, present and future.

 In the event of insolvency (concurso) of the Issuer, under the Spanish Insolvency Law, claims relating to the Notes (which are not subordinated pursuant to Article 281 of the Spanish Insolvency Law) will be ordinary credits (créditos ordinarios) as defined in the Spanish Insolvency Law. Ordinary credits rank below credits against the insolvency state (créditos contra la masa) and credits with a privilege (créditos privilegiados). Ordinary credits rank above subordinated credits and the rights of shareholders.

 Accrued and unpaid interest due in respect of the Notes at the commencement of an insolvency proceeding (concurso) of the Issuer will qualify as subordinated credits. Accrual of interest on the Notes shall be suspended as from the date of any declaration of insolvency (concurso) in relation to the Issuer.

 (b) Guarantee: The Guarantor has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed the due payment of all sums expressed to be payable by the Issuer under the Notes and Coupons on an unsubordinated basis. The obligations of the Guarantor in respect of Notes constitute direct, general, unconditional and (subject to Condition 5 (Negative Pledge)) unsecured obligations of the Guarantor and in the event of insolvency (concurso) of the Guarantor (unless they qualify as subordinated under Article 281 of the Spanish Insolvency Law or equivalent legal provision which replaces it in the future and subject to any legal and statutory exceptions) will rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Guarantor, present and future. Its obligations in that respect (the “Guarantee”) are contained in the Deed of Guarantee.

**5** **Negative Pledge**

So long as any Note remains outstanding, neither the Issuer nor the Guarantor shall, and the Guarantor
shall procure that none of its Subsidiaries will, create or permit to subsist any Security Interest (other than
a Permitted Security Interest) upon the whole or any part of its present or future undertaking, assets or
revenues (including uncalled capital) to secure any Relevant Indebtedness or guarantee of Relevant
Indebtedness without (a) at the same time or prior thereto securing the Notes equally and rateably
therewith or (b) providing such other security for the Notes as may be approved by an Extraordinary
Resolution of Noteholders.

**6** **Fixed Rate Note Provisions**

### (a) Application: This Condition 6 is applicable to the Notes only if the Fixed Rate Note Provisions are specified in the relevant Final Terms as being applicable.

 (b) Accrual of interest: The Notes bear interest from the Interest Commencement Date at the Rate of Interest payable in arrear on each Interest Payment Date, subject as provided in Condition 9 (Payments - Bearer Notes) and Condition 10 (Payments - Registered Notes). Each Note will cease to bear interest from the due date for final redemption unless, upon due presentation, payment of the Redemption Amount is improperly withheld or refused, in which case it will continue to bear interest in accordance with this Condition 6 (as well after as before judgment) until whichever is the earlier of (i) the day on which all sums due in respect of such Note up to that day are received by or on behalf of the relevant Noteholder, and (ii) the day which is 7 days after the Fiscal Agent

A44408936

## 54


-----

### has notified the Noteholders that it has received all sums due in respect of the Notes up to such seventh day (except to the extent that there is any subsequent default in payment).

 (c) Fixed Coupon Amount: The amount of interest payable in respect of each Note for any Interest Period shall be the relevant Fixed Coupon Amount and, if the Notes are in more than one Specified Denomination, shall be the relevant Fixed Coupon Amount in respect of the relevant Specified Denomination.

 (d) Calculation of interest amount: The amount of interest payable in respect of each Note for any period for which a Fixed Coupon Amount is not specified shall be calculated by applying the Rate of Interest to the Calculation Amount, multiplying the product by the relevant Day Count Fraction, rounding the resulting figure to the nearest sub-unit of the Specified Currency (half a sub-unit being rounded upwards) and multiplying such rounded figure by a fraction equal to the Specified Denomination of such Note divided by the Calculation Amount. For this purpose a “sub-unit” means, in the case of any currency other than euro, the lowest amount of such currency that is available as legal tender in the country of such currency and, in the case of euro, means 1 cent.

**7** **Floating Rate Note Provisions**

(a) _Application: This Condition 7 is applicable to the Notes only if the Floating Rate Note Provisions are_
specified in the relevant Final Terms as being applicable.

(b) _Accrual of interest: The Notes bear interest from the Interest Commencement Date at the Rate of Interest_
payable in arrear on each Interest Payment Date, subject as provided in Condition 9 (Payments - Bearer
_Notes) and Condition 10 (Payments - Registered Notes). Each Note will cease to bear interest from the_
due date for final redemption unless, upon due presentation, payment of the Redemption Amount is
improperly withheld or refused, in which case it will continue to bear interest in accordance with this
Condition (as well after as before judgment) until whichever is the earlier of (i) the day on which all sums
due in respect of such Note up to that day are received by or on behalf of the relevant Noteholder, and (ii)
the day which is 7 days after the Fiscal Agent has notified the Noteholders that it has received all sums
due in respect of the Notes up to such seventh day (except to the extent that there is any subsequent default
in payment).

(c) _Screen Rate Determination – Floating Rate Notes not referencing Compounded Daily SONIA: If Screen_
Rate Determination is specified in the relevant Final Terms as the manner in which the Rate(s) of Interest
is/are to be determined, the Rate of Interest applicable to the Notes for each Interest Period will be
determined by the Calculation Agent on the following basis:

(i) if the Reference Rate is a composite quotation or customarily supplied by one entity, the
Calculation Agent will determine the Reference Rate which appears on the Relevant Screen Page
as of the Relevant Time on the relevant Interest Determination Date;

(ii) if Linear Interpolation is specified as applicable in respect of an Interest Period in the applicable
Final Terms, the Rate of Interest for such Interest Period shall be calculated by the Calculation
Agent by straight-line linear interpolation by reference to 2 rates which appear on the Relevant
Screen Page as of the Relevant Time on the relevant Interest Determination Date, where:

(A) one rate shall be determined as if the relevant period were the period of time for which rates
are available next shorter than the length of the relevant Interest Period; and

(B) the other rate shall be determined as if the relevant period were the period of time for which
rates are available next longer than the length of the relevant Interest Period;

A44408936

## 55


-----

_provided, however, that if no rate is available for a period of time next shorter or, as the case may_
be, next longer than the length of the relevant Interest Period, then the Financial Adviser (as defined
below) shall determine such rate at such time and by reference to such sources as it determines
appropriate;

(iii) in any other case, the Calculation Agent will determine the arithmetic mean of the Reference Rates
which appear on the Relevant Screen Page as of the Relevant Time on the relevant Interest
Determination Date;

(iv) if, in the case of (i) above, such rate does not appear on that page or, in the case of (iii) above, fewer
than 2 such rates appear on that page or if, in either case, the Relevant Screen Page is unavailable,
the Calculation Agent will:

(A) upon the Issuer’s request, to the extent legally and practicably possible, assist the Issuer
with requesting the principal Relevant Financial Centre office of each of the Reference
Banks to provide a quotation of the Reference Rate at approximately the Relevant Time on
the Interest Determination Date to prime banks in the Relevant Financial Centre interbank
market in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time;
and

(B) determine the arithmetic mean of such quotations; and

(v) if fewer than 2 such quotations are provided as requested, the Calculation Agent will determine the
arithmetic mean of the rates (being the nearest to the Reference Rate, as determined by the
Calculation Agent) quoted by major banks in the Principal Financial Centre of the Specified
Currency, selected by the Issuer, at approximately 11.00 a.m. (local time in the Principal Financial
Centre of the Specified Currency) on the first day of the relevant Interest Period for loans in the
Specified Currency to leading European banks for a period equal to the relevant Interest Period
and in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time,

and the Rate of Interest for such Interest Period shall be the sum of the Margin and the rate or (as the case
may be) the arithmetic mean so determined; provided, however, that if the Calculation Agent is unable to
determine a rate or (as the case may be) an arithmetic mean in accordance with the above provisions in
relation to any Interest Period, the Rate of Interest applicable to the Notes during such Interest Period will
be the sum of the Margin and the rate or (as the case may be) the arithmetic mean last determined in
relation to the Notes in respect of a preceding Interest Period.

(d) _Screen Rate Determination –_ SONIA: If Screen Rate Determination is specified in the relevant Final
Terms as the manner in which the Rate(s) of Interest is/are to be determined and the Final Terms specify
that the Reference Rate is SONIA, the Rate of Interest for each Interest Period will be calculated in
accordance with Condition 7(d)(i), Condition 7(d)(ii) or Condition 7(d)(iii) below, subject to the
provisions of Condition 7(d)(v) and Condition 7(d)(vi) below, as applicable:

(i) Where the Calculation Method is specified in the relevant Final Terms as being “SONIA
Compounded Daily”, the Rate of Interest for each Interest Period will be the Compounded Daily
SONIA plus or minus (as indicated in the relevant Final Terms) the Margin (if any), all as
determined by the Calculation Agent on the Interest Determination Date and the resulting
percentage being rounded (if necessary) to the fifth decimal place, with 0.000005 being rounded
upwards.

(ii) Where the Calculation Method is specified in the relevant Final Terms as being “SONIA Index
Compounded Daily”, the Rate of Interest for each Interest Period will be the Compounded Daily
SONIA Index plus or minus (as indicated in the relevant Final Terms) the Margin (if any), all as

determined by the Calculation Agent on the Interest Determination Date and the resulting
percentage being rounded (if necessary) to the fifth decimal place, with 0.000005 being rounded
upwards.

(iii) Where the Calculation Method is specified in the relevant Final Terms as being “SONIA Weighted
Average”, the Rate of Interest for each Interest Period will be the Weighted Average SONIA plus
or minus (as indicated in the relevant Final Terms) the Margin (if any), all as determined by the
Calculation Agent on the Interest Determination Date and the resulting percentage being rounded

would be determined by the Calculation Agent under an interest rate swap transaction if the Calculation
Agent were acting as Calculation Agent for that interest rate swap transaction under the terms of an
agreement incorporating the ISDA Definitions and under which:

(i) the Floating Rate Option (as defined in the ISDA Definitions) is as specified in the relevant Final
Terms;

Final Terms, the Rate of Interest for such Interest Period shall be calculated by the Calculation
Agent by straight-line linear interpolation by reference to 2 rates based on the relevant Floating
Rate Option, where:

(A) one rate shall be determined as if the Designated Maturity were the period of time for which
rates are available next shorter than the length of the relevant Interest Period; and

(B) the other rate shall be determined as if the Designated Maturity were the period of time for
which rates are available next longer than the length of the relevant Interest Period

_provided, however, that if there is no rate available for a period of time next shorter than the length_
of the relevant Interest Period or, as the case may be, next longer than the length of the relevant
Interest Period, then the Financial Adviser (as defined below) shall determine such rate at such
time and by reference to such sources as it determines appropriate.

(f) _Maximum or Minimum Rate of Interest: If any Maximum Rate of Interest or Minimum Rate of Interest is_
specified in the relevant Final Terms, then the Rate of Interest shall in no event be greater than the
maximum or be less than the minimum so specified.

(g) _Calculation of Interest Amount: The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after the time at which_
the Rate of Interest is to be determined in relation to each Interest Period, calculate the Interest Amount
payable in respect of each Note for such Interest Period. The Interest Amount will be calculated by
applying the Rate of Interest for such Interest Period to the Calculation Amount, multiplying the product
by the relevant Day Count Fraction, rounding the resulting figure to the nearest sub-unit of the Specified
Currency (half a sub-unit being rounded upwards) and multiplying such rounded figure by a fraction equal
to the Specified Denomination of the relevant Note divided by the Calculation Amount. For this purpose
a “sub-unit” means, in the case of any currency other than euro, the lowest amount of such currency that
is available as legal tender in the country of such currency and, in the case of euro, means 1 cent.

(h) _Publication: The Calculation Agent will cause each Rate of Interest and Interest Amount determined by_
it, together with the relevant Interest Payment Date, and any other amount(s) required to be determined

by it together with any relevant payment date(s) to be notified to the Paying Agents and each competent
authority, stock exchange and/or quotation system (if any) by which the Notes have then been admitted to
listing, trading and/or quotation as soon as practicable after such determination but (in the case of each
Rate of Interest, Interest Amount and Interest Payment Date) in any event not later than the first day of
the relevant Interest Period. Notice thereof shall also promptly be given to the Noteholders. The
Calculation Agent will be entitled to recalculate any Interest Amount (on the basis of the foregoing
provisions) without notice in the event of an extension or shortening of the relevant Interest Period. If the
Calculation Amount is less than the minimum Specified Denomination the Calculation Agent shall not be
obliged to publish each Interest Amount but instead may publish only the Calculation Amount and the
Interest Amount in respect of a Note having the minimum Specified Denomination.

(i) _Notifications etc:_ All notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates, calculations, quotations and
decisions given, expressed, made or obtained for the purposes of this Condition by the Calculation Agent
will (in the absence of manifest error) be binding on the Issuer, the Paying Agents, the Noteholders and
the Couponholders and (subject as aforesaid) no liability to any such Person will attach to the Calculation
Agent in connection with the exercise or non-exercise by it of its powers, duties and discretions for such
purposes.

(j) _Benchmark Discontinuation:_

(i) If a Benchmark Event occurs in relation to the Reference Rate when the Rate of Interest (or any

component part thereof) for any Interest Period remains to be determined by reference to such
Reference Rate, then the Issuer shall use its reasonable endeavours to appoint an Independent
Adviser, as soon as reasonably practicable, to determine a Successor Rate, failing which an
Alternative Rate (in accordance with Condition 7(j)(ii)) and, in either case, an Adjustment
Spread, if any (in accordance with Condition 7(j)(iii)) and any Benchmark Amendments (in
accordance with Condition 7(j)(iv)).

In making such determination an Independent Adviser appointed pursuant to this Condition 7(j)
shall act in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner as an expert. In the absence of
bad faith or fraud, the Independent Adviser shall have no liability whatsoever to the Issuer, the
Fiscal Agent, the Agents or the Noteholders for any determination made by it pursuant to this
Condition 7(j).

If (i) the Issuer is unable to appoint an Independent Adviser or (ii) the Independent Adviser
appointed by it fails to determine a Successor Rate or, failing which, an Alternative Rate in
accordance with this Condition 7(j) prior to the date which is 10 business days prior to the
relevant Interest Determination Date, the Reference Rate applicable to the immediate following
Interest Period shall be the Reference Rate applicable as at the last preceding Interest
Determination Date. If there has not been a first Interest Payment Date, the Reference Rate shall
be the Reference Rate applicable to the first Interest Period. For the avoidance of doubt, any
adjustment pursuant to this paragraph shall apply to the immediately following Interest Period
only. Any subsequent Interest Period is subject to the subsequent operation of this Condition 7(j).

(ii) If the Independent Adviser determines in its discretion that:

(A) there is a Successor Rate, then such Successor Rate and the applicable Adjustment Spread

shall subsequently be used in place of the Reference Rate to determine the Rate of Interest
for the immediately following Interest Period and all following Interest Periods, subject to
the subsequent operation of this Condition 7(j); or

A44408936

## 62


-----

A44408936


(B) there is no Successor Rate but that there is an Alternative Rate, then such Alternative Rate

and the applicable Adjustment Spread shall subsequently be used in place of the Reference
Rate to determine the Rate of Interest for the immediately following Interest Period and all
following Interest Periods, subject to the subsequent operation of this Condition 7(j).

(iii) The Adjustment Spread (or the formula or methodology for determining the Adjustment Spread)

shall be applied to the Successor Rate or the Alternative Rate (as the case may be). If the
Independent Adviser is unable to determine the quantum of, or a formula or methodology for
determining, such Adjustment Spread, then the Successor Rate or the Alternative Rate (as
applicable) will apply without an Adjustment Spread.

(iv) If any Successor Rate or Alternative Rate and, in either case, the applicable Adjustment Spread

is determined in accordance with this Condition 7(j) and the Independent Adviser determines in
its discretion (i) that amendments to these Conditions are necessary to ensure the proper operation
of such Successor Rate or Alternative Rate and/or (in either case) the applicable Adjustment
Spread (such amendments, the “Benchmark Amendments”), and (ii) the terms of the
Benchmark Amendments, then the Issuer shall, following consultation with the Fiscal Agent (or
the person specified in the applicable Final Terms as the party responsible for calculating the
Rate of Interest and the Interest Amount(s)), subject to giving notice thereof in accordance with
Condition 7(j)(v), without any requirement for the consent or approval of relevant Noteholders,
vary these Conditions to give effect to such Benchmark Amendments with effect from the date
specified in such notice (and for the avoidance of doubt, the Fiscal Agent shall, at the direction
and expense of the Issuer, consent to and effect such consequential amendments to the Agency
Agreement and these Conditions as may be required in order to give effect to this Condition 7(j)).

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Condition 7(j), the Calculation Agent or any Paying
Agent is not obliged to concur with the Issuer or the Independent Adviser in respect of any
changes or amendments as contemplated under this Condition 7(j) to which, in the sole opinion
of the Calculation Agent or the relevant Paying Agent, as the case may be, would impose more
onerous obligations upon it or expose it to any additional duties, responsibilities or liabilities or
reduce or amend the protective provisions afforded to the Calculation Agent or the relevant
Paying Agent (as applicable) in the Agency Agreement and/or these Conditions.

In connection with any such variation in accordance with this Condition 7(j)(iv), the Issuer shall
comply with the rules of any stock exchange on which the Notes are for the time being listed or
admitted to trading.

(v) Any Successor Rate, Alternative Rate, Adjustment Spread and the specific terms of any

Benchmark Amendments, determined under this Condition 7(j) will be notified at least 10
business days prior to the relevant Interest Determination Date by the Issuer to the Fiscal Agent,
the Calculation Agent and the Other Agents. In accordance with Condition 18, notice shall be
provided to the Noteholders promptly thereafter. Such notice shall be irrevocable and shall
specify the effective date of the Benchmark Amendments, if any.

(vi) No later than notifying the Noteholders of the same, the Issuer shall deliver to the Fiscal Agent a

certificate signed by two authorised signatories of the Issuer:

(A) confirming (x) that a Benchmark Event has occurred, (y) the relevant Successor Rate, or,
as the case may be, the relevant Alternative Rate and, (z) where applicable, any
Adjustment Spread and/or the specific terms of any relevant Benchmark Amendments, in
each case as determined in accordance with the provisions of this Condition 7(j); and

## 63


-----

A44408936


(B) certifying that the relevant Benchmark Amendments (if any) are necessary to ensure the
proper operation of such relevant Successor Rate, Alternative Rate and (in either case) the
applicable Adjustment Spread.

The Fiscal Agent shall display such certificate at its offices, for inspection by the Noteholders at
all reasonable times during normal business hours, or by electronic means at the discretion of the
Fiscal Agent.

(vii)Each of the Fiscal Agent, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agents shall be entitled to rely

on such certificate (without liability to any person) as sufficient evidence thereof. The Successor
Rate or Alternative Rate and the Adjustment Spread (if any) and the Benchmark Amendments (if
any) specified in such certificate will (in the absence of manifest error or bad faith in the
determination of such Successor Rate or Alternative Rate and such Adjustment Spread (if any)
and such Benchmark Amendments (if any)) be binding on the Issuer, the Fiscal Agent, the
Calculation Agent, the Other Agents and the Noteholders. The Calculation Agent, the Fiscal
Agent and the Other Agents may rely on any such certificate without any further enquiry, and
shall not be obliged to verify whether the same contains a manifest error or whether the Issuer
has acted in bad faith.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Condition 7(j), if following the determination of any
Successor Rate, Alternative Rate, Adjustment Spread (if any) or Benchmark Amendments (if
any), in the Calculation Agent’s opinion there is any uncertainty between two or more alternative
courses of action in making any determination or calculation under this Condition 7(j), the
Calculation Agent shall promptly notify the Issuer thereof and the Issuer shall direct the
Calculation Agent in writing as to which alternative course of action to adopt. If the Calculation
Agent is not promptly provided with such direction, or is otherwise unable (other than due to its
own gross negligence, willful default or fraud) to make such calculation or determination for any
reason, it shall notify the Issuer thereof and the Calculation Agent shall be under no obligation
to make such calculation or determination and (in the absence of such gross negligence, willful
default or fraud) shall not incur any liability for not doing so.

(viii) Without prejudice to the obligations of the Issuer under Condition 7(j)(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), the

Reference Rate and the fallback provisions provided for in the definition of the term “Reference
Rate” in Condition 7(c) will continue to apply unless and until a Benchmark Event has occurred.

(ix) As used in this Condition 7(j):

“Adjustment Spread” means either (a) a spread (which may be positive negative, or zero), or (b)
a formula or methodology for calculating a spread, in each case to be applied to the Successor
Rate or the Alternative Rate (as the case may be) and is the spread, formula or methodology which:

(A) in the case of a Successor Rate, is formally recommended in relation to the replacement
of the Reference Rate with the Successor Rate by any Relevant Nominating Body; or

(B) if no such recommendation has been made, or in the case of an Alternative Rate, the
Independent Adviser determines, is customarily applied to the relevant Successor Rate or
the Alternative Rate (as the case may be) in international debt capital markets transactions
to produce an industry-accepted replacement rate for the Reference Rate; or

(C) if the Independent Adviser determines that no such spread is customarily applied, the
Independent Adviser determines, is recognised or acknowledged as being the industry
standard for over-the-counter derivative transactions which reference the Reference Rate,

## 64


-----

A44408936


where such rate has been replaced by the Successor Rate or the Alternative Rate (as the
case may be); or

(D) if no such spread, formula or methodology can be determined in accordance with (A) to
(C) above, the Independent Adviser, and acting in good faith and in a commercially
reasonable manner, determines to be appropriate, having regard to the objective, so far as
is reasonably practicable in the circumstances and solely for the purposes of this subparagraph (D) only, of reducing or eliminating any economic prejudice or benefit (as the
case may be) to the Noteholders.

“Alternative Rate” means an alternative benchmark or screen rate which the Independent Adviser
determines in accordance with Condition 7(j)(ii) is customarily applied international debt capital
markets for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest (or the relevant component part
thereof) in the Specified Currency.

“Benchmark Amendments” has the meaning given to it in Condition 7(j)(i).

“Benchmark Event” means:

(A) the Reference Rate ceasing to be published for a period of at least five (5) Business Days
or ceasing to exist; or

(B) a public statement by the administrator of the Reference Rate that it has ceased or that it
will cease publishing the Reference Rate permanently or indefinitely (in circumstances
where no successor administrator has been appointed that will continue publication of
the Reference Rate); or

(C) a public statement by the supervisor of the administrator of the Reference Rate, that the
Reference Rate has been or will be permanently or indefinitely discontinued; or

(D) a public statement by the supervisor of the administrator of the Reference Rate as a
consequence of which the Reference Rate will be prohibited from being used either
generally, or in respect of the relevant Floating Rate Notes; or

(E) the making of a public statement by the supervisor of the administrator of the Reference
Rate that the Reference Rate is or will be (or is or will be deemed by such supervisor to
be) no longer representative of its relevant underlying market; or

(F) it has become unlawful for any Paying Agent, the Calculation Agent, the Issuer or any
other party to calculate any Rate of Interest using the Reference Rate,

provided that the Benchmark Event shall be deemed to occur (I) in the case of sub-paragraphs (B)
and (C) above, on the date of the cessation of publication of the Reference Rate or the
discontinuation of the Reference Rate, as the case may be, (II) in the case of subparagraph (D)
above, on the date of the prohibition of use of the Reference Rate, and (III) in the case of subparagraph (E) above, on the date with effect from which the Reference Rate will no longer be (or
will be deemed by the relevant supervisor to no longer be) representative of its relevant underlying
market and which is specified in the relevant public statement, and, in each case, not the date of
the relevant public statement.

The occurrence of a Benchmark Event shall be determined by the Issuer and promptly notified to
the Fiscal Agent, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agents. For the avoidance of doubt, neither
the Fiscal Agent, the Calculation Agent nor the Paying Agents shall have any responsibility for
making such determination.

Downgrade Event in respect of the Change of Control occurs; or

(ii) (if at the time that the Change of Control occurs there are no Rated Securities outstanding) a
Negative Rating Event in respect of the Change of Control occurs,

(the Change of Control and Rating Downgrade Event or the Change of Control and Negative Rating Event,
as the case may be, occurring within the Change of Control Period, together called a “Put Event”), each
holder of the Notes shall have the option (unless, before the giving of the Put Event Notice (as defined
below), the Issuer shall have given notice under Condition 8(b) (Redemption and Purchase - Redemption
_for tax reasons) to redeem the Notes) to require the Issuer to redeem or, at the Issuer’s option, purchase_
(or procure the purchase of) any of its Notes at the Optional Redemption Amount (Put) together with (or,
where purchased, together with an amount equal to) interest accrued to but excluding the Put Date (as
defined below). Such option (the “Put Option”) shall operate as set out below.

nature of the Put Event and the procedure for exercising the Put Option.

In order to exercise the Put Option, the holder of a Note must, during the period commencing on the date

(ii) if the aggregate amount of the missing Coupons is greater than the amount of principal due for
payment:

(A) so many of such missing Coupons shall become void (in inverse order of maturity) as will
result in the aggregate amount of the remainder of such missing Coupons (the “Relevant
**Coupons”) being equal to the amount of principal due for payment; provided, however, that**
where this sub-paragraph would otherwise require a fraction of a missing Coupon to become
void, such missing Coupon shall become void in its entirety; and

(B) a sum equal to the aggregate amount of the Relevant Coupons (or, if less, the amount of
principal due for payment) will be deducted from the amount of principal due for payment;
provided, however, that, if the gross amount available for payment is less than the amount
of principal due for payment, the sum deducted will be that proportion of the aggregate
amount of the Relevant Coupons (or, as the case may be, the amount of principal due for
payment) which the gross amount actually available for payment bears to the amount of
principal due for payment.

Each sum of principal so deducted shall be paid in the manner provided in paragraph (a) above

presented to it for payment, such Paying Agent will endorse thereon a statement indicating the amount
and date of such payment.

(k) _Exchange of Talons:_ On or after the maturity date of the final Coupon which is (or was at the time of
issue) part of a Coupon Sheet relating to the Bearer Notes, the Talon forming part of such Coupon Sheet

treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the taxing jurisdiction of the Issuer and the Guarantor
as a condition to relief or exemption from such taxes; or

(v) in relation to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer or similar taxes; or

(vi) to, or to a third party on behalf of, a Holder who is a fiduciary, a partnership, a limited liability

more than 30 days after the Relevant Date except to the extent that the Holder of such Note or
Coupon would have been entitled to such additional amounts on presenting or surrendering such
Note or Coupon or Note Certificate for payment on the last day of such period of 30 days; or

the Notes or the Coupons by or on behalf of the Issuer or the Guarantor will be paid net of any deduction
or withholding imposed or required pursuant to an agreement described in Section 1471(b) of the Code,
or otherwise imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any regulations thereunder

authority, stock exchange and/or quotation system which requires the appointment of a Paying
Agent and/or a Transfer Agent in any particular place, the Issuer shall maintain a Paying Agent
and/or a Transfer Agent having its Specified Office in the place required by such competent
authority, stock exchange and/or quotation system.

Notice of any change in any of the Paying Agents or in their Specified Offices shall promptly be given to

**16** **Meetings of Noteholders; Modification and Waiver**

(a) _Meetings of Noteholders: The Agency Agreement contains provisions for convening meetings of_
Noteholders to consider matters relating to the Notes, including the modification of any provision of these
Conditions. Any such modification may be made if sanctioned by an Extraordinary Resolution. Such a
meeting may be convened by the Issuer or the Guarantor and shall be convened by them upon the request
in writing of Noteholders holding not less than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes. The quorum at any meeting convened to vote on an Extraordinary Resolution will be
2 or more persons holding or representing one more than half of the aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes or, at any adjourned meeting, 2 or more persons being or representing Noteholders
whatever the principal amount of the Notes held or represented; provided, however, that Reserved Matters
may only be sanctioned by an Extraordinary Resolution passed at a meeting of Noteholders at which 2 or
more persons holding or representing not less than 3-quarters or, at any adjourned meeting, one quarter of
the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes form a quorum. Any Extraordinary Resolution
duly passed at any such meeting shall be binding on all the Noteholders and Couponholders, whether
present or not.

In addition, a resolution in writing signed by or on behalf of Noteholders of not less than 90% of the
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes will take effect as if it were an Extraordinary
Resolution. Such a resolution in writing may be contained in one document or several documents in the
same form, each signed by or on behalf of one or more Noteholders.

(b) _Modification: The Notes, these Conditions, the Deed of Covenant and the Deed of Guarantee may be_
amended without the consent of the Noteholders or the Couponholders to correct a manifest error. In
addition, the parties to the Agency Agreement may agree to modify any provision thereof, but the Issuer
and the Guarantor shall not agree, without the consent of the Noteholders, to any such modification unless
it is of a formal, minor or technical nature, it is made to correct a manifest error or it is, in the sole opinion
of the Issuer or the Guarantor (as the case may be), not materially prejudicial to the interests of the
Noteholders.

**17** **Further Issues**

The Issuer may from time to time, without the consent of the Noteholders, create and issue further notes
having the same terms and conditions as the Notes in all respects (or in all respects except for the first
payment of interest) so as to form a single series with the Notes.

**18** **Notices**

(a) _Bearer Notes:_ Notices to the Holders of Bearer Notes shall be valid if published in a leading English
language daily newspaper published in London (which is expected to be the Financial Times) and, if the
Bearer Notes are admitted to trading on Euronext Dublin and it is a requirement of applicable law or
regulations, a leading newspaper having general circulation in Ireland or published on the website of
Euronext Dublin or, in either case, if such publication is not practicable, in a leading English language
daily newspaper having general circulation in Europe. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given
on the date of first publication (or if required to be published in more than one newspaper, on the first date
on which publication shall have been made in all the required newspapers). Couponholders shall be
deemed for all purposes to have notice of the contents of any notice given to the Holders of Bearer Notes.

(b) _Registered Notes: Notices to the Holders of Registered Notes shall be sent to them by first class mail (or_
its equivalent) or (if posted to an overseas address) by airmail at their respective addresses on the Register
and, if the Registered Notes are admitted to trading on Euronext Dublin and it is a requirement of
applicable law or regulations, notices to Noteholders will be published on the date of such mailing in a
leading newspaper having general circulation in Ireland or published on the website of Euronext Dublin
or, in either case, if such publication is not practicable, in a leading English language daily newspaper
having general circulation in Europe. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the fourth
day after the date of mailing.

**19** **Currency Indemnity**

If any sum due from the Issuer or the Guarantor in respect of the Notes or the Coupons or any order or
judgment given or made in relation thereto has to be converted from the currency (the “first currency”)
in which the same is payable under these Conditions or such order or judgment into another currency (the
“second currency”) for the purpose of (a) making or filing a claim or proof against the Issuer or the
Guarantor, (b) obtaining an order or judgment in any court or other tribunal, or (c) enforcing any order or
judgment given or made in relation to the Notes, the Issuer, failing whom the Guarantor, shall indemnify
each Noteholder, on the written demand of such Noteholder addressed to the Issuer and the Guarantor and
delivered to the Issuer and the Guarantor or to the Specified Office of the Fiscal Agent, against any loss
suffered as a result of any discrepancy between (i) the rate of exchange used for such purpose to convert
the sum in question from the first currency into the second currency, and (ii) the rate or rates of exchange
at which such Noteholder may in the ordinary course of business purchase the first currency with the

A44408936

## 80


-----

second currency upon receipt of a sum paid to it in satisfaction, in whole or in part, of any such order,
judgment, claim or proof.

This indemnity constitutes a separate and independent obligation of the Issuer and the Guarantor and shall
give rise to a separate and independent cause of action.

**20** **Rounding**

For the purposes of any calculations referred to in these Conditions (unless otherwise specified in these
Conditions or the relevant Final Terms), (a) all percentages resulting from such calculations will be
rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point (with 0.000005% being
rounded up to 0.00001%), (b) all United States dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculations
will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one half cent being rounded up), (c) all Japanese Yen amounts
used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded downwards to the next lower whole Japanese
Yen amount, and (d) all amounts denominated in any other currency used in or resulting from such
calculations will be rounded to the nearest 2 decimal places in such currency, with 0.005 being rounded
upwards.

**21** **Governing Law and Jurisdiction**

(a) _Governing law: The Notes and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with the_
Notes are governed by English law. Condition 4 (Status and Guarantee) is governed by Spanish law.

(b) _English courts: The courts of England have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute (a “Dispute”)_
arising out of or in connection with the Notes (including any non-contractual obligation arising out of or
in connection with the Notes).

(c) _Appropriate forum: Each of the Issuer and the Guarantor agrees that the courts of England are the most_
appropriate and convenient courts to settle any Dispute and, accordingly, that it will not argue to the
contrary.

(d) _Service of process: Each of the Issuer and the Guarantor agrees that the documents which start any_
proceedings relating to a Dispute and any other documents required to be served in relation to those
proceedings relating to a Dispute may be served on it by being delivered to Cellnex UK Limited, R+, 4th
floor, 2 Blagrave Street, Reading, United Kingdom RG1 1AZ, or to such other person with an address in
England or Wales and/or at such other address in England or Wales as the Issuer and the Guarantor may
specify by notice in writing to the Noteholders. Nothing in this paragraph shall affect the right of any
Noteholder to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made
available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive
2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97, where
that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; [or
(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the Prospectus Regulation]. Consequently, no key
information document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 (the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or
selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and
therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may
be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.]

**[MIFID II product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market – Solely for the**
purposes of [the/each] manufacturer's product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the
Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional
clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible
counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. [Consider any negative target market]. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the
manufacturer[’s/s’] target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for
undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the
manufacturer[’s/s’] target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.]

**[PROHIBITION OF SALES TO UK RETAIL INVESTORS – The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold**
or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor
in the United Kingdom (“UK”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i)
a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No. 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic
law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of
the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made
under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional

client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law
by virtue of the EUWA; [or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the Prospectus Regulation as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA]. Consequently no key information document required by
Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs
**Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK**
has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail
investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.]

**[UK MIFIR product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market –** Solely for the
purposes of [the/each] manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the
Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined
in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in
Regulation (EU) No. 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the [European Union (Withdrawal)
Act 2018][EUWA] (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties
and professional clients are appropriate. [Consider any negative target market]. Any person subsequently
offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the
manufacturer[’s/s’] target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product
Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible
for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the
manufacturer[’s/s’] target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.]

### FORM OF GUARANTEE

_The following is the form of the Guarantee of the Notes executed by the Guarantor on 3 August 2021._

**This Deed of Guarantee is made on 3 August 2021 by Cellnex Telecom, S.A. (the “Guarantor”) in favour of**
the Holders and the Accountholders.

**Whereas:**

(A) Cellnex Finance Company, S.A.U. (the “Issuer”) proposes to issue euro medium term notes guaranteed
by the Guarantor (the “Notes”, which expression shall, if the context so admits, include the Global Notes
(in temporary or permanent form) to be initially delivered in respect of the Notes and any related coupons
and talons) pursuant to a fiscal agency agreement dated 3 August 2021 between, among others, the Issuer,
the Guarantor and The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch as Fiscal Agent (the “Fiscal Agent”).

(B) The Issuer has, in relation to the Notes issued by it, entered into a deed of covenant (the “Deed of
**Covenant”) dated 3 August 2021.**

(C) The Guarantor has agreed to guarantee the payment of all sums expressed to be payable from time to
time by the Issuer in respect of the Notes to the holders of any Notes (the “Holders”) issued by it and
under the Deed of Covenant to the Accountholders (the “Guarantee”).

**This Deed of Guarantee Witnesses as follows:**

**1** **Interpretation**

**1.1** **Defined Terms: In this Deed, unless otherwise defined herein, capitalised terms shall have the same**
meaning given to them in the Deed of Covenant and the Conditions (as defined in the Deed of Covenant).

**1.2** **Headings: Headings shall be ignored in construing this Deed.**

**1.3** **Contracts: References in this Deed to this Deed or any other document are to this Deed or these**
documents as amended, supplemented, replaced or novated from time to time in relation to the
Programme and includes any document that amends, supplements, replaces or novates them.

**1.4** **Legislation or regulation: Any reference in this Deed to any legislation (whether primary legislation or**
regulations or other subsidiary legislation made pursuant to primary legislation) shall be construed as a
reference to such legislation as the same may have been, or may from time to time be, amended or reenacted.

**2** **Guarantee and Indemnity**

**2.1** **Guarantee: The Guarantor unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees that if the Issuer does not pay**
any sum payable by it under the Deed of Covenant or the Notes by the time and on the date specified for
such payment (whether on the normal due date, on acceleration or otherwise), the Guarantor shall pay
that sum to each Holder and each Accountholder before close of business on that date in the city to which
payment is so to be made. All payments under this Guarantee by the Guarantor shall be made subject to
the Conditions.

**2.2** **Guarantor as Principal Debtor: As between the Guarantor, the Holders and the Accountholders but**
without affecting the Issuer’s obligations, the Guarantor shall be liable under this Guarantee as if it were
the sole principal debtor and not merely a surety. Accordingly, its obligations shall not be discharged,
nor shall its liability be affected, by anything that would not discharge it or affect its liability if it were
the sole principal debtor, including (1) any time, indulgence, waiver or consent at any time given to the
Issuer or any other person, (2) any amendment to any other provisions of this Guarantee or to the

A44408936

## 97


-----

Conditions or to any security or other guarantee or indemnity, (3) the making or absence of any demand
on the Issuer or any other person for payment, (4) the enforcement or absence of enforcement of this
Guarantee, the Notes, the Deed of Covenant or of any security or other guarantee or indemnity, (5) the
taking, existence or release of any security, guarantee or indemnity, (6) the dissolution, amalgamation,
reconstruction or reorganisation of the Issuer or any other person or (7) the illegality, invalidity or
unenforceability of or any defect in any provision of this Guarantee, the Notes, the Deed of Covenant or
any of the Issuer’s obligations under any of them.

**2.3** **Guarantor’s Obligations Continuing: The Guarantor’s obligations under this Guarantee are and shall**
remain in full force and effect by way of continuing security until no sum remains payable under the
Notes, the Deed of Covenant or this Guarantee and no further Notes may be issued by the Issuer under
the Programme. Furthermore, those obligations of the Guarantor are additional to, and not instead of,
any security or other guarantee or indemnity at any time existing in favour of any person, whether from
the Guarantor or otherwise and may be enforced without first having recourse to the Issuer, any other
person, any security or any other guarantee or indemnity. The Guarantor irrevocably waives all notices
and demands of any kind.

**2.4** **Exercise of Guarantor’s Rights: So long as any sum remains payable under the Notes, the Deed of**
Covenant or this Guarantee, the Guarantor shall not exercise or enforce any right, by reason of the
performance of any of its obligations under this Guarantee, to be indemnified by the Issuer or to take the
benefit of or enforce any security or other guarantee or indemnity.

**2.5** **Avoidance of Payments: The Guarantor shall on demand indemnify the relevant Holder or**
Accountholder, on an after tax basis, against any cost, loss, expense or liability sustained or incurred by
it as a result of it being required for any reason (including any bankruptcy, insolvency, winding-up,
dissolution or similar law of any jurisdiction) to refund all or part of any amount received or recovered
by it in respect of any sum payable by the Issuer under the Notes or the Deed of Covenant and shall in
any event pay to it on demand the amount as refunded by it.

**2.6** **Debts of Issuer: If any moneys become payable by the Guarantor under this Guarantee, the Issuer shall**
not (except in the event of the liquidation of the Issuer) so long as any such moneys remain unpaid, pay
any moneys for the time being due from the Issuer to the Guarantor.

**2.7** **Indemnity: As separate, independent and alternative stipulations, the Guarantor unconditionally and**
irrevocably agrees: (1) that any sum that, although expressed to be payable by the Issuer under the Notes,
the Deed of Covenant or this Guarantee, is for any reason (whether or not now existing and whether or
not now known or becoming known to the Issuer, the Guarantor, a Holder or an Accountholder) not
recoverable from the Guarantor on the basis of a guarantee shall nevertheless be recoverable from it as
if it were the sole principal debtor and shall be paid by it to the Holder or Accountholder (as the case
may be) on demand; and (2) as a primary obligation to indemnify each Holder and Accountholder against
any loss suffered by it as a result of any sum expressed to be payable by the Issuer under the Notes, the
Deed of Covenant or this Guarantee not being paid on the date and otherwise in the manner specified in
this Guarantee or in the Conditions or any payment obligation of the Issuer under the Notes, the Deed
of Covenant or this Guarantee being or becoming void, voidable or unenforceable for any reason
(whether or not now existing and whether or not now known or becoming known to a Holder or an
Accountholder), the amount of that loss being the amount expressed to be payable by the Issuer in respect
of the relevant sum.

**2.8** **Incorporation of Terms: The Guarantor agrees that it will comply with and be bound by all such**
provisions contained in the Conditions which relate to it.

**3** **Payments**

clear of, and without withholding or deduction for, any taxes, duties, assessments or governmental
charges of whatever nature imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by or within Spain or any
authority therein or thereof having power to tax, unless such withholding or deduction is required by
law. In that event, the Guarantor shall pay such additional amounts as shall result in receipt by the
Holders and Accountholders of such amounts as would have been received by them had no such
withholding or deduction been required, except that no such additional amounts shall be payable:

3.1.1 **Other connection: to, or to a third party on behalf of, a Holder or Accountholder who is liable**
to such taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges in respect of such Note or Coupon by
reason of his having some connection with Spain other than the mere holding of the Note or
Coupon; or

3.1.2 **Demand for payment more than 30 days after the Relevant Date: in respect of any demand**
for payment made more than 30 days after the Relevant Date except to the extent that the Holder
or Accountholder would have been entitled to such additional amounts on making such demand
on the thirtieth such day; or

3.1.3 **Information requested by Spanish Tax Authorities: to, or to a third party on behalf of, a Holder**
or Accountholder who does not provide to the Issuer (or the Guarantor) or an agent acting on
behalf of the Issuer (or the Guarantor) the information concerning such Holder or Accountholder
and its Notes as may be required by the applicable Spanish tax laws and regulations, including a
duly executed and completed certificate from the Fiscal Agent, pursuant to Law 10/2014 and
Royal Decree 1065/2007 of 27 July, as amended by Royal Decree 1145/2011 of 29 July, and any
implementing legislation or regulation.

Defined terms used in this Clause 3.1 shall have the meanings given to them in the Conditions.

**3.2** **Stamp Duties: The Guarantor covenants to and agrees with the Holders and Accountholders that it shall**
pay promptly, and in any event before any penalty becomes payable, any stamp, documentary,
registration or similar duty or tax payable in Spain, Belgium or Luxembourg, as the case may be, or in
the country of any currency in which the Notes may be denominated or amounts may be payable in
respect of the Notes or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein in connection with
the entry into, performance, enforcement or admissibility in evidence of this Deed and/or any
amendment of, supplement to or waiver in respect of this Deed, and shall indemnify each of the Holders
and Accountholders, on an after tax basis, against any liability with respect to or resulting from any delay
in paying or omission to pay any such tax.

**4** **Amendment and Termination**

The Guarantor may not amend, vary, terminate or suspend this Guarantee or its obligations hereunder unless
such amendment, variation, termination or suspension shall have been approved by a resolution of the
Noteholders or to comply with any mandatory requirements set forth by any regulation, directives or rules
issued by the Spanish government or the relevant administrative authority, save that nothing in this Clause shall
prevent the Guarantor from increasing or extending its obligations hereunder by way of supplement to this
Guarantee at any time.

**5** **Currency Indemnity**

If any sum due from the Guarantor under this Deed or any order or judgment given or made in relation thereto
has to be converted from the currency (the “first currency”) in which the same is payable under this Deed or
such order or judgment into another currency (the “second currency”) for the purpose of (a) making or filing

A44408936

## 99


-----

a claim or proof against the Guarantor, (b) obtaining an order or judgment in any court or other tribunal or (c)
enforcing any order or judgment given or made in relation to this Deed, the Guarantor shall indemnify each
beneficiary on demand against any loss suffered as a result of any discrepancy between (i) the rate of exchange
used for such purpose to convert the sum in question from the first currency into the second currency and (ii)
the rate or rates of exchange at which such Holder or Accountholder may in the ordinary course of business
purchase the first currency with the second currency upon receipt of a sum paid to it in satisfaction, in whole or
in part, of any such order, judgment, claim or proof.

This indemnity constitutes a separate and independent obligation of the Guarantor and shall give rise to a
separate and independent cause of action.

**6** **General**

**6.1** **Benefit: This Guarantee shall enure for the benefit of the Holders and the Accountholders.**

**6.2** **Deposit of Guarantee: The Guarantor shall deposit this Guarantee with the Fiscal Agent, to be held by**

copy of, this Guarantee.

shall be governed by and construed in accordance with English law.

**7.2** **Jurisdiction: The courts of England are to have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any disputes that may**
arise out of or in connection with this Deed and accordingly any legal action or proceedings arising out
of or in connection with this Deed (“Proceedings”) may be brought in such courts. The Guarantor
irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such courts and waives any objection to Proceedings in such
courts whether on the ground of venue or on the ground that the Proceedings have been brought in an
inconvenient forum.

**7.3** **Agent for Service of Process: The Guarantor irrevocably appoints Cellnex UK Limited, R+, 4th floor,**

### History and Development

In 2000 the Guarantor’s predecessor, Acesa Telecom, S.A., a company within the Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A.
group (“Abertis”), embarked upon its journey in the audiovisual sector and in mobile radio-communications for
security and emergency corps by acquiring 100% of the shares of Tradia Telecom, S.A.U. The Group started the
Telecom Infrastructure Services segment in 2001 on the back of its experience in broadcasting services.

From 2012 onwards, it started an expansion process with the acquisition of 1,000 telecommunication
infrastructures from Telefónica Móviles, S.A. (“Telefónica”) and the acquisition of 1,854 infrastructures from
Telefónica and Xfera Móviles, S.A.U. (“Yoigo”). In 2014, the Group started its international expansion by
acquiring TowerCo S.p.A. and its portfolio of telecom infrastructures as of the time of acquisition along Italian
motorways, and deployed the first IoT network in Spain, positioning itself as a reference player in the construction
of an “IoT Ecosystem” in Spain.

In 2015, the Group continued its expansion in Italy through the acquisition of 90% of Galata (currently, Cellnex
Italia, S.p.A. – “Cellnex Italy”), owner of approximately 7,377 sites, over which it acquired full ownership by
2017. On 7 May 2015, Cellnex’s shares were admitted to listing on the Spanish Stock Exchanges under the
symbol “CLNX” and, as a consequence of its initial public offering, Abertis sold 66% of Cellnex’s share capital.

In 2016, six new DTT channels began their emissions, all of which had signed contracts with the Group. Also in
2016, the Group started its operations in the Netherlands and continued its expansion in Italy through the
acquisition of CommsCon (currently Cellnex Italy), owner of 949 nodes. That same year, the Group started its
operations in France with the agreement reached with Bouygues Telecom, S.A. (“Bouygues Telecom”) to acquire
500 sites and also entered into an agreement for the acquisition of the Shere Group (currently “Cellnex UK
**Limited”), owner of 1,004 sites in the United Kingdom. In 2016, the IBEX 35 Technical Advisory Committee**
approved the entry of Cellnex into the main stock index of the Spanish market.

On 19 January 2017, the managers of the FTSE4GOOD sustainability index announced that Cellnex had been
incorporated into that index. Also in the first quarter of 2017, the Group reached an agreement with Bouygues
Telecom for the acquisition of 1,800 sites and building of additional 1,200 urban infrastructures in France.
Additionally, in 2017, JCDecaux and the Group announced their commercial alliance in Italy and Spain to speed
up the roll-out of DAS networks and “Small Cells” to improve the capacity and quality of 4G coverage (and 5G
in the future) in urban areas.

Also in 2017, the Group entered into a framework agreement with Iliad Italia, S.p.A. providing full flexibility for
the MNO’s network deployment. Additionally, Cellnex Switzerland, AG (“Cellnex Switzerland”) acquired from
Sunrise Communications International S.A. (“Sunrise”) and Skylight S.à.r.l. 100% of the share capital of Swiss
Towers AG (“Swiss Towers”), a subsidiary of the Swiss mobile operator, in a consortium with Swiss Life and
Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners at Cellnex Switzerland level (of which Cellnex owned a 63% stake at the
time). This acquisition involved the integration of 2,239 telecommunication sites located in Switzerland. Further,
the Group acquired Infracapital Alticom B.V. (“Alticom”), owner of 30 sites located in the Netherlands,
consolidating the Group’s position among neutral telecommunications infrastructure operators in the Netherlands
and integrating key elements to the future roll-out of 5G.

In the first half of 2018, the Group acquired 100% of Zenon Digital Radio, S.L. from Palol Inversiones, S.L.U.,
and 85 sites in Spain from the MASMOVIL group. Also, during the first half of 2018, Cellnex Switzerland and
Heliot, S.A., Sigfox’s operator in Switzerland, signed an agreement to roll-out the first global IoT network
operated in Switzerland.

In July 2018, Cellnex reached an agreement for the acquisition of 100% of the share capital of Xarxa Oberta de
Comunicació i Tecnologia de Catalunya, S.A. (“XOC”), a concessionary company dedicated to the management,
maintenance and construction of the optic fiber network of the Generalitat de Catalunya, and the expiration date

of the concession is 2031. Also during the second half of 2018, the Group signed an agreement with Nearby
Sensors S.L. (“Nearby Sensors”) under which the Group indirectly acquired an ownership interest of
approximately 15% in the share capital of Nearby Sensors in exchange for a contribution of €0.5 million, which
was increased in the first half of 2019 by an additional 15% in exchange for a further contribution of €0.5 million
(amounting to a 30% ownership interest of the Group in Nearby Sensors’s share capital). Nearby Sensors,
established in 2013, is based in Barcelona and its business relates to the rolling out IoT, edge computing, and the
automation of IT-OT hybrid processes (industrial IoT) that are expected to emerge with the roll-out of 5G.

In the second half of 2018, the Group reached an agreement with Bouygues Telecom to build up to 88 strategic
telecom centers in a five-year term, and to acquire up to 62 additional strategic telecom centers. These centers
are strategic facilities with traffic concentration capabilities which will play a key role in the future deployment
of 5G networks.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Group extended the agreement between Cellnex Switzerland and Sunrise,
including an additional acquisition of 133 sites in Switzerland for an amount of CHF 39 million (€34 million),
which were transferred to Swiss Towers on 1 January 2019, and also the build-to-suit program with Sunrise in
up to 75 additional sites (from up to 400 to up to 475 sites). Also, in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Group acquired
375 sites from MNOs in Spain, through Cellnex’s fully owned subsidiary On Tower Telecom Infraestructuras,
S.A.U. (“On Tower Spain”), for an amount of €45 million.

In the first half of 2019, Cellnex, through its subsidiary Cellnex Italia, S.r.L. (currently Cellnex Italy), entered
into an extension of the agreement with Wind Tre S.p.A. (“Wind Tre”) which was entered into in the context of
the acquisition of Galata (currently Cellnex Italy) in 2015, and increased the build-to-suit program in up to 800
additional sites (from up to 400 to up to 1,200 sites), which Cellnex Italy will build in a 10-year term from the
2015 agreement, with a total investment of up to €70 million. Also, in the first half of 2019, the Group entered
into an agreement with British Telecommunications (“BT”) to operate and market 220 high towers located in the
United Kingdom for a period of 20 years. The consideration paid amounted to GBP 70 million, approximately
(approximately €79 million). The agreement included a pre-emptive right of acquisition of Cellnex Connectivity
Solutions Limited of up to 3,000 sites from BT during the following six years.

Also in the first half of 2019, the Group entered into a long-term industrial alliance with the Iliad7 group of
companies by virtue of which the Group purchased 70% of the share capital of Iliad 7, S.A.S., owner of
approximately 5,700 sites located in France (the “Iliad France Acquisition”), and acquired approximately 2,200
sites located in Italy (the “Iliad Italy Acquisition”), for an estimated aggregate consideration of approximately
€1.4 billion and €600 million, respectively. Additionally, the Group agreed to the deployment of 2,500 and 1,000
sites in France and Italy, respectively, over a seven-year term. Among other effects, these transactions allowed
the Group to strengthen its footprint in the French market as the leading independent telecommunications
infrastructures operator with a network of dense and capillary sites that will play a key role in the deployment of
5G in France and also allowed the Group to strengthen its footprint in the Italian market.

Also, in the first half of 2019 the Group entered into a long-term industrial alliance with Matterhorn Telecom SA
(“Matterhorn”) by virtue of which Swiss Towers purchased 90% of the share capital of Swiss Infra Services SA
(“Swiss Infra”), owner of approximately 2,800 sites located in Switzerland, for an aggregate consideration of
approximately €770 million. Additionally, the Group agreed to the deployment of 500 sites in Switzerland in an
eight-year term (the “Swiss Infra Acquisition”). Among other effects, this transaction allowed the Group to
strengthen its footprint in the Swiss market. On 12 March 2021, Cellnex (through its subsidiaries Cellnex
Switzerland, of which Cellnex owns 72.22%, and Swiss Towers, of which Cellnex Switzerland owns 100%)
entered into an agreement with Matterhorn to acquire 10% of the share capital of Swiss Infra from Matterhorn,
for CHF 146 million (with a Euro value of €131.5 million as of the date of completion). Pursuant to this
acquisition, which was completed on 18 March 2021, Swiss Towers holds 100% of Swiss Infra.

In the second half of 2019, the Group reached an agreement to acquire 100% of the share capital of On Tower
Netherlands BV (“On Tower Netherlands”) from its shareholders which, in turn, owns all the shares of the On
Tower Netherlands subsidiaries, for a total consideration (Enterprise Value) of €40 million. As a result of this
acquisition, the Group acquired 114 additional infrastructures in the Netherlands. Also, in the second half of 2019,
the Group acquired from, amongst others, InfraVia Capital Partners, 100% of the share capital of Cignal
Infrastructure Limited (“Cignal”), owner of 546 sites in Ireland and agreed to the deployment of up to 600 new
additional sites by 2026 by Cignal, for a total consideration (Enterprise Value) of approximately €210 million
(the “Cignal Acquisition”).

Also, in the second half of 2019, Cellnex and Cellnex UK Limited entered into an agreement with Arqiva
Holdings Limited, a company of the Arqiva group (the “Arqiva Group”), for the sale and purchase of 100% of
the issued and paid up share capital of Arqiva Services Limited (the “Arqiva Acquisition”), a company to which
the Arqiva Group carved-out the UK telecoms towers business of the Arqiva Group following a full
reorganisation of assets, liabilities and activities. The Group completed the Arqiva Acquisition in July 2020,
acquiring full ownership of the share capital of Arqiva Services Limited (currently On Tower UK), which is the
owner of approximately 7,400 held sites and the rights to market approximately 900 sites located in United
Kingdom. The Group paid an aggregate consideration of approximately GBP 2 billion.

In the last quarter of 2019, the Group (through On Tower Spain and Towerlink Portugal, Unipessoal Lda) and El
Corte Inglés, S.A. signed a long-term strategic agreement according to which the Group acquired the rights to
operate and market the connectivity infrastructure of approximately 900 sites for a period of 50 years. The
acquisition price amounted to approximately €66 million. Also, the Group (through On Tower Spain) reached an
agreement with Orange Espagne, S.A.U. (“Orange Spain”) for the acquisition of 1,500 telecom sites in Spain
for a total consideration (Enterprise Value) of €260 million.

In the first quarter of 2020, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of CLNX Portugal, S.A. (“Cellnex
**Portugal” – formerly Belmont Infra Holding, S.A.) from Belmont Infra Investments B.V. and PT Portugal SGPS,**
S.A. and the credit rights under certain capital contributions (prestações acessórias) made by both of them to
Cellnex Portugal (the “Omtel Acquisition”). Cellnex Portugal owns Omtel, Estruturas de Comunicaçoes, S.A.
(“Omtel”), which currently operates a nationwide portfolio of 3,000 sites in Portugal. The consideration for the
acquisition was approximately €800 million (equivalent Enterprise Value), estimated as of the date of the
transaction, subject to certain price adjustments. On 2 January 2020, Cellnex paid €300 million in cash, assumed
€233 million of debt of the acquired subgroup, which Cellnex fully repaid after closing of the acquisition and
incorporated €43 million of cash balances. The remaining balance of the consideration (which, as of the date of
signing, was approximately 50% of the total fair market value of Cellnex Portugal, amounting to a deferred
payment of €570 million) will be paid on the earlier of 31 December 2027 or upon the occurrence of certain
events of default. Additionally, Omtel and MEO – Serviços De Comunicações E Multimédia, S.A. (“MEO”) are
party to a master service agreement (“MSA”), which, among other things, sets forth a build-to-suit program of
up to approximately 500 sites by 15 December 2023. The Group expects that this program could be increased by
up to at least 600 additional sites by 2027. The Group estimates that the related capital expenditure for this buildto-suit program, including the expected 600 additional sites, is expected to amount to at least approximately €140
million, which the Group expects to finance with cash generated by the portfolio. Among other effects, the Omtel
Acquisition allowed the Group to incorporate a new market leader client in Portugal (MEO) and joins a
diversified mix of clients in Europe, covering the leading operators in the markets in which the Group operates.
In addition, in view of the arrival of 5G, requiring network densification and efficient roll-out, it will enable the
Group to propose an attractive solution to mobile operators both in terms of cost and speed of execution.

In the second quarter of 2020, the Group reached an agreement with the Portuguese mobile operator NOS, SGPS
S.A. (“NOS”), for the acquisition from NOS Comunicações, S.A. of shares representing 100% of On Tower
Portugal, S.A.’s (formerly NOS Towering Gestão de Torres de Telecomunicações, S.A.) (“On Tower Portugal”)

share capital and the assignment to the Group of the credit rights under certain capital contributions (prestações
_acessórias) made by NOS Comunicações, S.A. to On Tower Portugal, for a preliminary consideration (Enterprise_
Value) of approximately €374 million, although the final consideration amounted to approximately €399 million
(the “NOS Towering Acquisition”). Upon completion of the NOS Towering Aquisition in the second half of
2020, On Tower Portugal operated a portfolio of approximately 2,000 sites in Portugal. Additionally, the Group
expects to acquire up to approximately 400 additional new or existing sites from the NOS group by 2026 (the
Group treats this commitment as a build-to-suit program and expects that this program can be increased by at
least 250 additional sites) and other agreed initiatives, with an estimated investment of at least approximately
€175 million. The Group financed this acquisition with available cash and expects to finance the deployment of
new or existing additional sites using cash flows generated by the portfolio and other internal resources. The NOS
Towering Acquisition strengthened the Group’s industrial project in Portugal.

In the first half of 2020, the Group and Bouygues Telecom reached a strategic agreement, through which they
became shareholders of Nexloop France, S.A.S., a newly incorporated company (49% owned by Bouygues
Telecom and 51% owned by Cellnex, although, taking into account both the signed shareholders’ agreement and
the financing structure agreed for the new company, the Group will have in practice an effective right to 100% of
the expected cash flows generated after debt service up until 2055, subject to certain limitations, either through
shareholder loan remuneration or through preferred dividends). This company will deploy a national optic fiber
network in France to provide mobile and fixed fiber based connectivity and especially accelerate the roll-out of
5G in the country. The agreement comprises the roll-out of a network of up to 31,500 km, interconnecting the
telecommunications rooftops and towers providing service to Bouygues Telecom (approximately 5,000 of which
belong to, and are operated by, the Group) with the network of “metropolitan offices” for housing data processing
centers (Edge Computing). The agreement covers the deployment of up to 90 new “metropolitan offices”. The
estimated investment up to 2027, amounts to up to approximately €1.1 billion.

In the second half 2020, the Group acquired Edzcom Oy, which provides end-to-end Private LTE Networks for
critical markets based on Edge Connectivity solutions. Through this acquisition, the Group believes it is better
positioned to provide greater added value to its customers, as Edge Connectivity is expected to become a
cornerstone for digitalization and to build the smart industries of the future. Further, Red.es awarded the
development of a 5G pilot project in the metropolitan area of Barcelona to a consortium led by the Group and the
MASMOVIL group. Also, in the second half of 2020, the Group acquired 60% of the share capital of Metrocall,
S.A., the neutral operator that manages and operates the telecommunications infrastructure and services in
Madrid’s suburban transport network, which has ten-year services contracts with the main mobile operators for
the use of their infrastructure to provide coverage and mobile connectivity to users of the Madrid underground
system.

Additionally, the Group incorporated the Issuer to carry out financing activities or financing-related support
activities for the benefit of the Group. In December 2020, Cellnex contributed €1 billion to the Issuer and the
Group assigned certain of its financing contractual obligations to the Issuer, which became the borrower under
such loans and credit facilities. The corporate purpose of the Issuer is to carry out financing activities or financingrelated support activities for the benefit of the companies within the Group by means of, among others, the
issuance of bonds or other debt securities, as well as the entry into any banking financing, any other kind of
financings, or the issuance of any instruments with a financing purpose; the management, optimization and
distribution of monetary resources and assistance to the companies in the Group; and the granting of all kinds of
financings, as well as grant of guarantees of any kind and nature to guarantee the obligations assumed by any of
the Group companies.

Also, in the second half of 2020, the Group reached an agreement with CK Hutchison Networks Europe
Investments S.à.r.L. (“Hutchison”) for the acquisition of Hutchison’s European tower business and assets in
Austria, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, the United Kingdom and Sweden by way of six separate transactions (i.e. one

transaction per country) (the “CK Hutchison Holdings Transactions”). Pursuant to the CK Hutchison Holdings
Transactions, the Group agreed to acquire shares representing 100% of the share capital of six companies (CK
Hutchison Networks (Austria) GmbH, On Tower Denmark ApS, CK Hutchison Networks (Ireland) Limited, CK
Hutchison Networks Italia S.p.A., CK Hutchison Networks (UK) Limited and HI3G Networks AB) which operate
a portfolio of approximately 24,560 telecommunications sites in aggregate located in Austria, Denmark, Ireland,
Italy, the United Kingdom and Sweden (approximately 4,500, 1,300, 1,120, 9,140, 6,000 and 2,500 sites,
respectively). Combined, the CK Hutchison Holdings Transactions contemplate a total consideration (subject to
certain adjustments) of approximately €10 billion of which approximately €8.6 billion is expected to be paid in
cash and approximately €1.4 billion in new and/or treasury shares of Cellnex. Additionally, the Group anticipates
further deployment requests of up to 5,284 new sites, which are expected to be rolled out in Austria, Denmark,
Ireland, Italy, the United Kingdom and Sweden, by 2026, 2024, 2025, 2027, 2022 and 2025, respectively. The
estimated investment in connection with such additional new sites and further initiatives amounts to up to €1.15
billion. The CK Hutchison Holdings Transactions in respect of Austria, Denmark and Ireland were completed at
the end of December 2020 following satisfaction or waiver of all applicable conditions precedent. In addition,
the CK Hutchison Holdings Transactions in respect of Sweden and Italy were completed on 25 January 2021 and
30 June 2021, respectively, following satisfaction or waiver of all applicable conditions precedent. Completion
of the CK Hutchison Holdings Transactions in respect of the United Kingdom remains subject to certain
remaining conditions precedent, including in connection with customary anti-trust and foreign investment
clearances, which are expected to be satisfied or waived in 2022.

The consideration for the CK Hutchison Holdings Transaction in respect of the United Kingdom is expected to
be settled upon closing partly in cash and partly by the issue to Hutchison of new shares of Cellnex and (if
applicable) the transfer to Hutchison of shares of Cellnex. On 29 March 2021, the general shareholders’ meeting
of Cellnex approved (delegating its execution on the Board of Directors) a share capital increase by means of an
in-kind contribution for the payment of the portion of the consideration to be settled in shares. The number of
new shares that Hutchison is expected to receive is approximately 27 million shares, with Cellnex expecting to
transfer such amount of additional treasury shares as is necessary to reach the approximately €1.4 billion
consideration owed to Hutchison (with the exact number of shares to be received by Hutchison based on the
Cellnex share price at closing). The aggregate number of new and/or treasury shares to be transferred to Hutchison
is subject to adjustment in case certain events relating to Cellnex’s share capital occur prior to completion of the
CK Hutchison Holdings Transaction in respect of the United Kingdom, including, among others, issues of shares
in Cellnex by way of conferring subscription or purchase rights. Hutchison is expected to hold at closing of the
CK Hutchison Holdings Transaction in respect of the United Kingdom an interest of between approximately 4.4%
and 6.2% in Cellnex’s share capital, assuming that no adjustment events occur.

Also in the last quarter of 2020, the Group and Everynet entered into an agreement to deploy Smart IoT networks
based in LoRaWAN technology in Italy, the United Kingdom and Ireland, and BASF and the Group announced
an agreement to deploy the first private 5G network in a chemical plant in Spain.

### Recent Developments 

_T-Mobile Infra Acquisition_

On 21 January 2021, the Group entered into a framework agreement with Deutsche Telekom A.G. (“DTAG”),

same date, DIV signed a sale and purchase agreement with DTEU (and DTAG as guarantor) for 100% of the
shares of T-Mobile Infra for a consideration of approximately €397 million, to be financed by DIV with available
cash obtained from its limited partners (the “T-Mobile Infra SPA”).

Additionally, T-Mobile Infra and T-Mobile Netherlands, B.V. agreed to the deployment of a minimum of 180
additional sites in the Netherlands over a seven-year term for an estimated total consideration of approximately
€10 million.

The T-Mobile Infra Acquisition was completed on 1 June 2021, following receipt of, among others, customary
regulatory authorisations.

DIV is an alternative investment fund managed by Digital Transformation Capital Partners Luxembourg GP
S.à.r.l. and anchored by DTAG and Cellnex (through an investment vehicle) as initial limited partners (initially
holding 67% and 33% of DIV’s share capital, respectively), among others, with a mandate to invest mainly into
European digital infrastructure assets such as towers, fiber and data centers. As part of the T-Mobile Infra
Acquisition, Cellnex signed a commitment letter, pursuant to which it committed to invest €200 million in DIV.
On 26 May 2021, DIV drew approximately €136 million, which Cellnex paid with available cash. Such funds
were used to finance a portion of the amounts payable by DIV under the T-Mobile Infra SPA, among others. As
soon as other investors become limited partners in DIV, DIV will refund to funds’ initial limited partners part of
the initial investment to adjust it to their resulting stake in DIV.

Upon closing of the T-Mobile Infra Acquisition, Cellnex and DIV signed a deal flow agreement which set forth
Cellnex’s right to co-invest with a stake of 51%, subject to certain conditions, in opportunities originated by DIV
in relation to towers, rooftops, masts, small cells or build-to-suit programs.

_Hivory Acquisition_

On 3 February 2021, the Group (through Cellnex France Groupe (“Cellnex France”)) entered into a put option
agreement with Altice France, S.A.S. (“Altice”) and Starlight HoldCo S.à r.l (“Starlight HoldCo”), which gave
the right to Altice and Starlight HoldCo to require the Group to purchase, on an exclusive basis, their respective
direct and indirect ownerships in the share capital of Hivory, S.A.S. (“Hivory”), which in aggregate amount to
approximately 100% of Hivory’s share capital, for an estimated consideration (Enterprise Value) of
approximately €5.2 billion (the “Hivory Acquisition”). There is also a minority interest holding less than 0.01%
of the share capital of Hivory, which is outside the scope of the Hivory Acquisition. Altice and Starlight HoldCo
exercised their put option on 19 May 2021, and on that same date entered into a sale and purchase agreement
with Cellnex France for the sale and purchase of approximately 100% of Hivory’s share capital.

Hivory owns and operates approximately 10,535 sites in France. In particular, Hivory is a party to a master
services agreement with Société Française du Radiotéléphone (“SFR”), entered into on 30 November 2018, for
the provision of certain services by Hivory to SFR (the “Hivory MSA”). Pursuant to an amendment letter to the
Hivory MSA between Altice and the Group entered into on 3 February 2021 (the “Hivory MSA Amendment”),
the parties have a commitment to execute an amendment to the Hivory MSA providing for, among other things,
a revised build-to-suit program, including the commitment of SFR to require Hivory to construct 1,000 new sites
in France until 31 December 2028 and a possibility for SFR to require Hivory to construct up to 2,500 sites in
France in aggregate, for an estimated investment of approximately €0.9 billion.

The Group reached an agreement with Altice to advance the payment of a portion of the committed Build-to-suit
program under the Hivory MSA, as amended by the Hivory MSA Amendment.

Completion of the Hivory Acquisition is subject to certain conditions precedent and closing is expected in the
second half of 2021.

_Iliad Poland Acquisition_

On 22 October 2020, Cellnex Poland sp. z.o.o. (“Cellnex Poland”) reached an agreement with Iliad Purple SAS
(“Iliad Purple”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Iliad S.A. (jointly, “Iliad”) to acquire 60% of the share capital
of a new Polish telecommunications tower company (Elphin Sp. z o.o., to be renamed as On Tower Poland sp.
z.o.o. (“On Tower Poland”)) which would subsequently own the tower portfolio in Poland of P4 sp. z.o.o. (“P4”),
a wholly owned subsidiary of Play Communications S.A. (“Play”) (the “Iliad Poland Acquisition”). The
transaction was signed in the context of the takeover bid launched by Iliad over Play on 21 September 2020 and
completed on 25 November 2020.

On 23 February 2021, Play and Cellnex Poland agreed to modify the structure of the Iliad Poland Acquisition by
virtue of an amended and restated sale and purchase agreement by means of which Play would sell to Cellnex
Poland 60% of the share capital of On Tower Poland while the remaining 40% would be sold to Iliad Purple.

The Iliad Poland Acquisition was completed on 31 March 2021, following the satisfaction of the relevant
conditions precedent.

On 31 March 2021, P4 sold the assets (and related liabilities) comprising its telecommunications passive
infrastructure business unit to On Tower Poland, with an initial portfolio of approximately 7,428 sites (including
the legacy 6,911 sites and 517 additional sites constructed before completion of the Iliad Poland Acquisition), for
an estimated total consideration (Enterprise Value) of approximately €1,458 million (at an exchange rate of €1.00
= Polish zloty (“PLN”) 4.6038). The legacy 6,911 sites were funded by Cellnex Poland and Iliad in proportion
to their respective shareholder stake in On Tower Poland, thus the Group funded approximately €801 million (at
an exchange rate of €1.00 = PLN 4.6038), and the 517 additional sites were funded solely by the Group via
intercompany debt for an investment of €123 million (at an exchange rate of €1.00 = PLN 4.6038). This represents
a total payment financed by the Group of €919 million (or €924 million, excluding operating cash delivered to
the Group as part of the transaction) (at an exchange rate of €1.00 = PLN 4.6038).

Additionally, P4 has undertaken the firm commitment to propose to On Tower Poland the acquisition of a
minimum of 1,871 sites on or before 31 December 2030, although the deployment of up to approximately 4,462
new sites is expected by the Group.

_Polkomtel Acquisition_

On 26 February 2021, Cellnex Poland entered into an agreement with Cyfrowy Polsat s.a. (“Cyfrowy”) and
Polkomtel sp. z.o.o. (“Polkomtel”) to acquire 99.99% of the share capital of Polkomtel Infrastruktura sp. z.o.o.
(“Polkomtel Infrastruktura”), for an estimated total consideration (Enterprise Value) of approximately €1,540
million (at an exchange rate of €1.00 = PLN 4.59) (the “Polkomtel Acquisition”). Polkomtel Infrastruktura
manages a portfolio of approximately 7,000 passive infrastructure and active infrastructures in Poland
(approximately 37,000 radio carriers covering relevant bands used by 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G technologies in Poland,
approximately 11,300 km of fiber backbone and fiber-to-the-tower backhaul and a national network of microwave
radiolinks).

The closing of the Polkomtel Acquisition took place on 8 July 2021, following the satisfaction of the relevant
conditions precedent.

Upon completion of the Polkomtel Acquisition, Polkomtel Infrastruktura, Polkomtel and Aero 2 sp. z.o.o. (a
MNO within the Polkomtel Group – “Aero”) entered into an MSA pursuant to which Polkomtel has undertaken
to submit pre-orders requesting Polkomtel Infrastruktura to construct a minimum of 1,000 sites before the tenth
anniversary of the date of the MSA, although the deployment of up to approximately 1,500 sites is expected by
the Group. Additionally, pursuant to the MSA, each of Polkomtel and Aero have undertaken to submit pre-orders
requesting Polkomtel Infrastruktura to provide them with an aggregate of 15,000 additional emission services

### Business

 General Overview

The Group’s business model focuses on the provision of services to MNOs, broadcasters and other public and
private companies acting as a neutral infrastructure provider (for example, by not having one or more MNOs as
a significant shareholder represented in the Board of Directors and other governance bodies of Cellnex). This
business model is based on innovative, efficient, sustainable, neutral and quality management to create value for
the Group’s shareholders, customers, employees and other stakeholders.

The Group provides services related to infrastructure management for terrestrial telecommunications through the
following three segments: (i) Telecom Infrastructure Services, (ii) Broadcasting Infrastructure and (iii) Other
Network Services.

  - Telecom Infrastructure Services: this is the Group’s largest segment by turnover. It provides a wide range
of integrated network infrastructure services to enable access to the Group’s telecom infrastructure by
MNOs and other wireless telecommunications and broadband network operators, allowing such operators
to offer their own telecommunications services to their customers.

  - Broadcasting Infrastructure: this is the Group’s second largest segment by turnover. The Group currently
provides broadcasting services only in Spain, where it is the only operator offering nationwide coverage
of the DTT service (source: CNMC). Its services consist of the distribution and transmission of television
and radio signals, the operation and maintenance of broadcasting networks, the provision of connectivity
for media content and over-the-top (“OTT”) broadcasting services and other services. Through the
provision of broadcasting services, the Group has developed unique know-how that has helped to develop
other services within its portfolio.

  - Other Network Services: the Group provides the infrastructure required to develop a connected society by
providing network services such as data transport, security and control, Smart communication networks
including IoT, Smart Services, managed services and consulting, as well as optic fiber services. As a
telecom infrastructure operator, the Group can facilitate, streamline and accelerate the deployment of these
services through the efficient connectivity of objects and people, in both rural and urban environments,
helping to build territories enabled by genuine Smart infrastructure services. This constitutes a specialized
business that generates relatively stable cash flows with potential for further growth.

As of 31 March 2021, the Group had 68,350 sites, operating 24%, 26%, 7%, 21%, 23%, 41%, 36%, 48%, 27%,
16%, 21% and 60% of the infrastructures in Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France,
Switzerland, Ireland, Portugal, Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Poland, respectively (source: Arthur D. Little,
latest available data). As a result of the closings of the T-Mobile Infra Acquisition, the CK Hutchison Holdings
Transaction in respect of Italy and the Polkomtel Acquisition, which were completed on 1 June, 30 June and 8
July 2021, respectively, the Group owns and operates 3,150 additional sites in the Netherlands, 9,140 additional
sites in Italy and 7,000 additional sites in Poland. Upon the completion of the CK Hutchison Holdings Transaction
in respect of the United Kingdom and the Hivory Acquisition, the Group expects to own and operate
approximately 6,000 and 10,535 additional sites in the United Kingdom and France, respectively.

The Group believes to be the leading neutral telecom infrastructure operator in Europe, while also being the main
broadcasting infrastructure operator in Spain and enjoying the number one position in DTT nationwide
broadcasting coverage. The Group’s commitment to operational excellence has resulted in strong commercial
relationships with blue-chip for MNOs and TV and radio broadcasters, as well as with public administrations and
utility companies to whom it provides its services.

**_Telecom Infrastructure Services_**

### Overview

Operating income from the Group’s Telecom Infrastructure Services segment was €1,272,583 thousand for the
year ended 31 December 2020, which represented 79%, of the Group’s consolidated operating income for such
period, and €694,248 thousand for the year ended 31 December 2019, restated, which represented 67% of the
Group’s consolidated operating income for such period.

The Group’s backlog as of 31 December 2020 and as of 31 December 2019 for the Telecom Infrastructure
Services segment was approximately €35,283,069 thousand and €19,006,281 thousand, respectively.

### Services

The Group provides to its customers in Telecom Infrastructure Services coverage related services and access to
the Group’s telecom or broadcasting infrastructures for MNOs to co-locate their equipment on the Group’s
infrastructures, offering additional services that allow MNOs to rationalise their networks and optimise costs,
through the dismantling of duplicate infrastructures (decommissioning) and building up new infrastructures
(build-to-suit) in strategic sites that can offer service to one or more MNOs. These services have the aim to
complete the deployment of 4G and 5G in the future, reduce areas with no signal coverage and extend network
densification. The Group acts as a neutral operator for MNOs (for example, by not having one or more MNOs as
a significant shareholder represented in the Board of Directors and other governance bodies of Cellnex) and other
telecom operators who generally require complete access to network infrastructure in order to provide services
to end users.

The Group acts as a multi-infrastructure operator. Its customers are responsible for the individual communication
equipment hosted in the Group’s telecom and broadcasting infrastructures. Revenue is primarily generated from
customer services agreements. The Group generally receives monthly payments from customers, payable under
long-term contracts (which in the case of anchor customers have long or undefined maturities with automatic
extensions, unless cancelled). The annual payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors,
including, but not limited to, the infrastructure location, the number and type of customer’s equipment on the
infrastructure, ground space required by the customer, customer ratio, equipment at the infrastructure and
remaining infrastructure capacity. The main costs typically include related services (which are primarily fixed,
with annual cost escalations) such as energy and ground costs, property taxes and repairs and maintenance.

The majority of the land and rooftops where the Group’s infrastructures are located are operated and managed
via lease contracts, sub-lease contracts or other types of contracts with third parties. In general, MNOs engage in
the maintenance of their own equipment under their responsibility, although in some cases they may subcontract
to the Group the maintenance of their equipment as a separate and additional service. In these cases, the
maintenance services are usually awarded through bidding processes to companies capable of providing such
services, such as vendors of equipment, maintenance and installation companies and other companies with
sufficient capacity to provide the services, such as the Group itself.

The Group has an extensive experience in DAS network solutions. As of 31 March 2021, the Group had deployed
approximately 3,370 DAS nodes, with a customer ratio of three MNOs per infrastructure, in venues such as
stadiums, skyscrapers, shopping malls, dense outdoor areas, airports, underground lines and railway stations.
DAS is a network of spatially distributed antennas connected to a common source, thus providing wireless service
within a specific geographic area. The system can support a wide variety of technologies and frequencies,
including 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G in the future. The Group works as a real neutral host, together with the MNOs, in
order to provide the optimal solution for the increasing need for coverage and densification in complex scenarios.
The Group manages the complete life cycle of the solution: infrastructure acquisition, design, installation,

A44408936

## 113


-----

commissioning, O&M, supervision and service quality assurance. The Group also operates active equipment of
the network in relation to the DAS nodes that it manages.

The Group is also developing capabilities in fiber to the tower and edge computing centers infrastructure, in order
to offer its clients the data processing capacity distributed in the network, without which the potential of 5G could
not be realised. As such, in 2017 the Group acquired Alticom, a Dutch company that owns a portfolio of sites
which has data centers, in 2018 and 2019 the Group signed an agreement to build 88 and acquire 62 edge
computing centers for Bouygues Telecom and in 2020 it extended the scope to build another 90 sites of such
characteristics with Bouygues Telecom in the context of the fiber co-investment deal to roll-out a transport
network (backhaul and backbone) connecting all key elements of the telecom network of Bouygues Telecom
through optic fiber.

### Customers and Contracts

The Group estimates, based on public information including annual reports, investor presentations and other
published data, that it is the leading neutral operator (for example, by not having one or more MNOs as a
significant shareholder represented in the Board of Directors and other governance bodies of Cellnex) of telecom
and broadcasting infrastructures in Europe by number of infrastructures as of 31 December 2020. As such, the
Group’s customer base includes the main MNOs in Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France,
Switzerland, Ireland, Portugal, Austria and Denmark and it has close and long-standing relationships with some
of the largest European MNOs and Spanish media broadcasting operators.

MNOs require the Group’s services mainly to increase network coverage, optimise their operating costs and
reduce capital expenditures and avoid any difficulties in the co-location of their networks among MNOs.

The Group has existing MSAs and master lease agreements (“MLAs”) with the main MNOs, including
Telefónica, Yoigo, Wind Tre, KPN, Bouygues Telecom, Sunrise, Iliad, Salt, Orange Spain, MEO, EE and BT,
NOS, CK Hutchison Holdings, Play Communications, T-Mobile and Cyfrowy. Upon completion of the Hivory
Acquisition the Group will also have MSAs and MLAs, as applicable, with SFR. Such agreements are framework
agreements providing certain terms that govern the contractual relationships related to the Group’s infrastructures
with such MNOs during the term of the MSA or MLA. In particular, the MSAs and MLAs specify the services
that the Group provides and the economic terms of the agreement. In the case of smaller MNOs, the Group may
enter into individual separate agreements negotiated ad hoc for each particular case as opposed to MSAs or
MLAs.

In general, the Group’s services contracts for co-location services with anchor customers have an initial noncancellable term of 10 to 20 years, with multiple renewal terms (which in the case of anchor customers have long
or undefined maturities with automatic extensions, unless cancelled), and payments that are typically revised
based on an inflationary index like the consumer price index (“CPI”) or on fixed escalators. The Group’s
customer contracts have historically had a high renewal rate. In this regard, the Group has experienced a high
renewal rate of its MSAs and MLAs with MNO customers over the last 10 years although none of the Group’s
agreements with anchor customers has reached its initial term. Contracts in place with Telefónica and Wind Tre
may be subject to change in terms of the fees being applied at the time of a renewal, within a predefined range of
the last annual fee (that reflects the cumulative inflation over the full initial term).

In the majority of cases, services contracts with costumers may not be terminated prior to the expiration of their
term except in extraordinary cases, such as loss of a license or failure to perform by the Group. In general, each
customer contract that is renewable will automatically renew at the end of its term unless the customer provides
prior notice of its intent not to renew. The Group believes that its customers tend to renew their services
agreements because of the quality of the services provided by the Group, and also because suitable alternative
infrastructures may not exist or be available and repositioning an infrastructure in their network may be expensive
and may adversely affect the quality of their network. The majority of the contracts with the Group’s anchor

A44408936

## 114


-----

customers may only be renewed for the entirety of the infrastructures and not for a portion thereof (“all-ornothing” clause), none of which have been renegotiated as of the date hereof.

### Competition

The Group estimates, based on public information, including annual reports, investor presentations and other
published data, that it is the leading neutral wireless telecom infrastructure operator in Europe by number of
infrastructures, with presence in Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France, Switzerland, Ireland,
Portugal, Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Poland. In all countries in which the Group operates, it competes
primarily against other infrastructures operators who provide regional co-location services. Its main competitors
within this segment are Vantage Towers, Telxius (which recently sold its telecommunication towers division in
Europe and in Latin America to American Tower), Inwit, TDF, Hivory (until completion of the Hivory
Acquisition), CTIL, MBNL (until completion of the CK Hutchison Holdings Transaction in respect of the United
Kingdom),, American Tower and Phoenix Tower. Furthermore, MNOs often operate their own infrastructures or
share infrastructures with other MNOs. In general, it faces competition for infrastructure services from various
companies, such as other neutral wireless telecom infrastructure owners or operators, including owners or
operators of towers, rooftops, water infrastructures, Small Cells, broadcast infrastructures, or utility poles, among
others.

**_Broadcasting Infrastructure_**

### Overview

Operating income from the Group’s Broadcasting Infrastructure segment was €227,257 thousand for the year
ended 31 December 2020, which represented 14% of the Group’s consolidated operating income for such period,
and €235,383 thousand for the year ended 31 December 2019, restated, which represented 23% of the Group’s
consolidated operating income for such period.

The Group’s backlog as of 31 December 2020 and as of 31 December 2019 for the Broadcasting Infrastructure
segment was approximately €577,901 thousand and €234,244 thousand, respectively.

The Group’s Broadcasting Infrastructure segment consists of the distribution and transmission of TV and radio
signals as well as the O&M of broadcasting networks, the provision of connectivity for media contents, OTT
broadcasting services and other services. As of the date of this Base Prospectus, the Group provides Broadcasting
Infrastructure services in Spain only.

The provision of these services requires unique high mast infrastructures that, in most cases, only the Group
owns, substantial spectrum management know-how, and the ability to comply with very stringent service levels.
In Spain, the broadcast infrastructures the Group manages provide more than 99% of population coverage with
DTT and radio, which is a combined portfolio larger than all of its competitors combined.

The Group’s Broadcasting Infrastructure segment is characterised by predictable, recurrent and stable cash flows
as well as by the high technical know-how that allows the Group to provide consulting services.

### Services

The Group classifies the services that it provides to its customers as a broadcast network operator in three groups:
(i) Digital TV, (ii) Radio and (iii) Other broadcasting services.

1. _Digital TV (distribution and broadcasting of DTT, DTT premium & Hybrid TV)_

The Group operates as a media distribution player throughout the entire broadcasting value chain by
owning the infrastructures and equipment that TV broadcasters use to compress and distribute the signal
in Spain.

A44408936

## 115


-----

The TV value chain encompasses a wide range of contractual relationships between a highly diverse set
of market players and from a contractual and technical point of view consists of six key steps. These
include content production (which can be done internally or externally), content aggregation, media
operations (i.e. programming), compression and multiplexing, signal distribution and signal transmission.
The Group is a leading player in the latter three stages of the value chain and a growing player in media
operations.

The digital TV spectrum is owned by the Spanish State and is typically licensed to public TV entities for
non-limited time periods and to the various media groups which own private TV channels for 15-year
periods, with automatic renewal. Most of the current licenses are valid until 2025, with some of them until
2030, with expected automatic renewal afterwards (source: CNMC). However, to the extent broadcasters
do not own any equipment or infrastructures (and do not intend to own them), the Group acts as an
infrastructure and network services provider to the channels, effectively being responsible for bringing the
signal from studios to the broadcasting infrastructures and transmitting it to the end users.

DTT’s strong position, with a screen share of 74% (as of 31 December 2020) in Spain is expected to
remain stable in the mid to long term as it is supported by a number of features and trends and significant
advantages relative to other platforms: (i) it is the only TV platform to offer more than 30 channels in the
Spanish language free of charge and with coverage of more than 99% of the population (source: Televisión
Digital. Gobierno de España); (ii) the most popular public and commercial channels are broadcast on DTT
(source: Televisión Digital. Gobierno de España); (iii) it is less costly for a TV entity to reach a TV
household in Spain via DTT than via direct-to-home (“DTH”); (iv) hybrid TV services, which take benefit
of broadband and broadcast, were launched nationally in the third quarter of 2018 and are expected to
bring interactivity, enrich the DTT platform and yield new revenue streams for the broadcasters (source:
Televisión Digital. Gobierno de España); (v) the diversity and the quality of the channels available are
expected to increase with the wide adoption of new technologies keeping the DTT platform innovative
and competitive; (vi) its superior coverage and traffic capacity; and (vii) the Spanish regulator has stated
on numerous occasions that they are highly supportive of DTT and, to date, is working on the spectrum
roadmap for the next decade in order to bring certainty to the broadcast industry according to the Decision
(EU) 2017/899.

The Group is the technological provider of the HbbTV of LOVEStv, the new audiovisual platform of DTT
developed by the public radio broadcaster RTVE and the two large Spanish private radio broadcasting
groups, Atresmedia and Mediaset Spain. This platform will allow the viewer to see the contents of the last
week from the television, as well as viewing programs from the beginning even if they have already
started.

2. _Radio (distribution and transmission of analogue and digital radio)_

The Group is one of the main players in the value chain of Spanish radio infrastructure. It is able to provide
services across the whole radio broadcasting value chain. The Group distributes radio signals, both
analogue and digital, with analogue FM being the dominant platform in Spain. Regarding the analogue
FM radio, the Group owns and manages a network infrastructure and the necessary equipment to provide
broadcasting services to public and private customers. The Group also hosts radio stations that want to
self-broadcast using its infrastructure.

The Group believes it is the largest radio broadcast operator in Spain. It broadcasts FM, AM and DAB
services and the largest players in Spain broadcast using the Group’s infrastructures. The Group is also a
significant provider of infrastructures to the other players although these tend to rely more on selfbroadcasting.

A44408936

## 116


-----

3. _Other broadcasting services (O&M, connectivity and others)_

The Group provides maintenance and connectivity services to its broadcasting customers.

### Customers and Contracts 

The Group’s customers within the Broadcasting Infrastructure segment include all national and most regional and
local TV broadcasters as well as leading radio station operators in Spain. Some of the key customers for DTT
services include Atresmedia, CTTI, Mediaset España, Net Televisión, Veo Televisión and RTVE.

The DTT broadcasting contracts do not have any volume risk, they have instead stable and visible pricing of
MUXs, are compliant with applicable regulations and contain attractive indexation terms. The main features of
the Group’s DTT broadcasting contracts are:

    - Medium-term contracts with high renewal rates. Complying with legal limitations, the Group usually
enters into either 5-year or 4-year maximum term contracts. The Group has experienced a high rate of
renewal for these types of contracts in the recent past, although price pressure from customers can be
possible when renegotiating contracts (as it has been the case in the recent cycle of contract renewals
the Group has just faced).

    - No volume risk. For each MUX distributed, the Group receives a “flat fee”, as long as the conditions
attached to the audiovisual licenses for TV channels do not change.

    - Stable and visible pricing. The prices the Group charges to its customers are negotiated between the
parties although the Group has to fulfil a series of regulatory requirements. In order to price its services,
the Group uses a method which has been fully disclosed to the telecom regulator and competition
authorities.

    - Indexation to CPI that allows the Group to cover increases in operational costs where CPI is positive.

The Group’s key customers for radio services include CATRADIO, Cope, Grupo Radio Blanca, Onda Cero,
RAC1 and RNE. The Group’s contracts with radio stations typically have a term of five years and the prices are
usually indexed to inflation.

The main customers for the Group’s other broadcasting services (O&M, connectivity and others) include,
amongst others, TVC, Junta de Castilla y León and RTVE. These contracts have an initial term of three years.

### Competition

According to the CNMC, the Group is the leading audiovisual media infrastructure operator in Spain with an
overall audiovisual broadcasting market share (TV and radio) of approximately 87% as measured by revenues as
of December 2019 (latest available). According to the CNMC, the total audiovisual broadcasting services at the
national and regional level generated €209,000 thousand of operating income for the same period, not including
pay TV and subsidies. The Group currently enjoys the number one position in DTT nationwide broadcasting
coverage.

**_Other Network Services_**

### Overview

Operating income from the Group’s Other Network Services segment was €104,932 thousand for the year ended
31 December 2020, which represented 7% of the Group’s consolidated operating income for such period, and
€101,214 thousand for the year ended 31 December 2019, restated, which represented 10% of the Group’s
consolidated operating income for such period.

A44408936

## 117


-----

The Group’s backlog as of 31 December 2020 and as of 31 December 2019 for this segment was approximately
€242,749 thousand and €162,499 thousand, respectively.

### Services

The Group classifies the type of services that it provides in this segment in five groups:

1. **_Connectivity services: these services include connectivity between different nodes of the_**
telecommunication networks (backhaul) of the Group’s clients and/or connectivity with its customers’
premises (enterprise leased lines), using radio-links, fiber or satellite. The Group also provides specialised
leased lines to telecom operators such as MNOs or fixed network operators (FNOs), public
administrations, and small and medium enterprises as well as companies in rural areas of Spain enabling
high speed connectivity.

2. **_MC&PN services: the Group operates seven regional and two municipal TETRA networks in Spain which_**
are critical for the communication needs of regional governments and municipalities where the networks
are located and a highly reliable Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) for the Maritime
Rescue Service for the Safety of Life at Sea, which provides communication services to ships in distress
and risk situations in the coastal areas around Spain. The Group also operates the Automatic Identification
System (AIS) for the Spanish Maritime Safety Agency, an arm of the Spanish Ministry of Transport,
Mobility and Urban Agenda.

3. **_O&M:_** the Group manages and operates infrastructure (as opposed to outsourcing it to third parties) and
provides maintenance services of customer equipment and infrastructure to the Group’s customers (other
than its broadcasting customers that are serviced by the Broadcasting Infrastructure segment).

4. **_Urban telecom infrastructure: the Group provides communications networks for smart cities and specific_**
solutions for efficient resource and service management in the cities.

5. **_Optic fiber: the Group uses optic fiber to connect its, or its clients’, infrastructures (macro cells, DAS and_**
Small Cells) and edge computing facilities. The Group acquired XOC in 2018, a concessionary company
dedicated to the management, maintenance and construction of the optic fiber network of the Generalitat
de Catalunya, that also provides optic fiber capacity to Spanish telcos and to enterprises (FTTE). Please
note that when the main customer is the public administration, and not an MNO, this business is reported
under the Other Network Services business segment.

### Customers and Contracts

The Group’s main customers for its connectivity services are BT, Orange Spain, COLT and Vodafone.
Connectivity contracts usually have an initial term of three years and the fees charged are linked to the number
of circuits deployed and the capacity used.

The Group serves multiple national, regional and local public entities for which it acts as a trusted supplier of
mission critical services and infrastructure. Some of the key customers for the public safety and emergency
networks services include the Gobierno de Navarra, the Spanish National Maritime Rescue, the Generalitat de
Catalunya and the Generalitat of Valencia.

The main customers for O&M services are Endesa and Lyntia. Although it varies depending on the particular
service, the O&M contracts usually have an initial term from two to ten years and the fees that the Group charges
its customers are linked to the quantity of equipment to be maintained and the particular type of maintenance
provided.

A44408936

## 118


-----

The key customers for the urban telecom infrastructure services are the city council of Barcelona, Red Eléctrica,
Sigfox and Securitas Direct. Some of the customers of other services are Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de
Catalunya and Asco-Vandellos Nuclear Association.

### Competition

The Group’s main competitors in the provision of connectivity services are MNOs providing wholesale access
such as Orange Spain, Telefónica and Vodafone.

Within the PPDR activity, the Group’s main competitor in Spain is Telefónica’s TETRAPOL network. In the
other services that the Group provides within this segment there is a wide range of competitors operating.

The Group’s main competitors in the provision of O&M services and trading are Ericsson, Huawei and others.

The Group’s main competitors in the provision of urban telecom infrastructure services are companies such as
Indra and Telefónica.

### Employees

As of 31 December 2020, the Group had a total of 2,008 employees.

### Legal Proceedings

At any given time, the Group may be a party to litigation or be subject to non-litigated claims arising out of the
normal operations of its business. The results of legal and regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with
certainty. The Group cannot guarantee that the results of current or future legal or regulatory proceedings or
actions will not harm the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows,
nor can it guarantee that it will not incur losses in connection with current or future legal or regulatory proceedings
or actions that exceed any provisions that it may have set aside in respect of such proceedings or actions or that
exceed any available insurance coverage, which may have an adverse effect on the Group’s business, prospects,
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

As of the date of this Base Prospectus the material legal proceedings outstanding are summarised below and they
all refer to antitrust and state aid proceedings or tax proceedings where the Group is involved. If any of these
legal proceedings were not resolved in the Group’s favor, it could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s
business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

  - On 19 May 2009, the CNMC imposed a fine of €22.7 million on Cellnex (at the time, Abertis Telecom,
S.A.U.) for an alleged abuse of dominant position in the market for transportation and broadcasting of TV
signal in Spain, contrary to article 2 of Spanish Act on Defense of Competition (Ley 15/2007, de 3 de julio,
_de Defensa de la Competencia, “LDC”) and article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU_
(“TFEU”). In the opinion of the CNMC, the Guarantor had allegedly abused its market power by (i)
demanding substantial sums of money from its customers as a penalty for early termination of contracts;
(ii) establishing contracts of excessive duration; and (iii) offering discounts if customers purchased more
than one service. The decision also imposed on the Guarantor a duty to grant certain customers of carrier
support services (Sogecable, Telecinco and Net TV) the right to terminate certain contracts unilaterally
and for whatever reason, by giving three months’ prior notice. Such notice can be given both for a partial
termination of any of the regional territories (placas regionales) or for the entire national territory. The
Guarantor requested the deferral of the payment of the fine until the Court ruled on the matter, a deferral
that was granted on 10 January 2010. The Guarantor also appealed the decision of the CNMC before the
Spanish High Court (Audiencia Nacional) which on 16 February 2012 denied the appeal and upheld the
decision on all grounds. The Guarantor further appealed the decision of the Spanish High Court to the

A44408936

## 119


-----

Supreme Court on 12 June 2012. The Supreme Court ruled on 23 April 2015 and partially granted the
appeal and declared that the CNMC resolution regarding the calculation of the fine was not in accordance
with law and ordered the CNMC to recalculate it. On 29 September 2016 the CNMC issued a decision
recalculating the aforementioned amount (€18.7 million), which was appealed to the Spanish High Court
on 9 December 2016. Furthermore, on 4 April 2017 Cellnex filed a claim which was responded by the
Spanish State Attorney. As of 31 December 2020, the Group has a recorded provision for a total of €18.7
million, the same amount that was recorded as of 31 December 2019, restated. The Spanish High Court
has not yet issued a ruling on the matter.

  - On 8 February 2012, the Spanish antitrust authorities imposed a fine of €13.7 million on Cellnex (at the
time, Abertis Telecom, S.A.U.) for an alleged abuse of dominant position in the DTT-signal transport
business in Spain contrary to article 2 LDC and article 102 of the TFEU. The alleged infringement derived
from the Guarantor establishing margin squeezing prices for (i) wholesale access to its broadcast centers
and infrastructures in Spain; and (ii) retail transport services for distribution of DTT signals. The Guarantor
filed an appeal against the Spanish antitrust authorities’ decision before the Spanish High Court (Audiencia
_Nacional) on 21 March 2012 and also requested the deferral of the payment of the fine until the Court_
rules on the matter, a deferral that was granted on 18 June 2012. The Spanish High Court ruled on 20
February 2015 and partially upheld the appeal of Cellnex. Cellnex further appealed the decision of the
Spanish High Court to the Supreme Court on 26 May 2015. On 23 March 2018, the Supreme Court
dismissed Cellnex’s appeal and therefore confirmed the existence of an abuse of dominant market position
and also set out that the CNMC shall recalculate the fine. A nullity incident was filed by Cellnex before
the Supreme Court which was dismissed on 19 July 2018. On 10 October 2018 Cellnex appealed before
the Constitutional Court (Tribunal Constitucional) the decision of the Supreme Court. On 13 February
2019, the Constitutional Court dismissed Cellnex’s appeal. The original bank guarantee was delivered on
4 February 2020. Following the corresponding calculation procedure, the CNMC has ruled that the amount
of the fine should not be amended. Cellnex has filed an appeal against such decision. With regard to these
proceedings, Cellnex registered a provision of €13.7 million as of 31 December 2020, the same amount
that was recorded as of 31 December 2019, restated.

Moreover, and as a result of the spin-off of Abertis Telecom, S.A.U. (currently Abertis Telecom Satélites,
S.A.U., “Abertis Telecom Satélites”) on 17 December 2013, Cellnex assumed any rights and obligations
that may arise from the aforementioned legal proceedings, as they relate to the spun-off business
(terrestrial telecommunications). An agreement has therefore been entered into between Cellnex and
Abertis Telecom Satélites stipulating that if the aforementioned amounts have to be paid, Cellnex will be
responsible for paying these fines. As of 31 December 2020, Cellnex has provided three guarantees
amounting to €32.5 million (€46.3 million at 31 December 2019, restated) to cover the disputed rulings
with the CNMC explained above, in addition to the provisions recorded and referred to in the paragraphs
above.

  - On 19 June 2013, the European Commission (the “EC”) issued a decision concluding that Retevisión and
other terrestrial platform operators had received state aid in the form of a €260 million scheme to finance
the digitalisation and extension of the terrestrial TV network in remote areas of Spain (other than CastileLa Mancha) during the digital switch-over process and that such state aid was incompatible with the EU
rules. The decision ordered the Kingdom of Spain to recover the aid, which according to the EC amounted
to an aggregate of €40 million for Retevisión. In October 2013 and February 2016, the Group filed appeals
with the General Court of the EU and the European Court of Justice, respectively. On 20 December 2017,
the European Court of Justice issued a judgment by means of which it immediately annulled the EC’s
decision, with the consequence that as of such date the recovery obligations incumbent upon the public

A44408936

## 120


-----

administrations and the obligations of the terrestrial platform operators to return the relevant amounts
lapsed.

Following the European Court of Justice’s annulment of its 2013 decision, the EC reopened its
investigation, and on 10 June 2021 issued a new decision concluding that the state aid scheme was
incompatible with EU rules and the aid should be recovered by the Kingdom of Spain. On this basis, the
government of Extremadura (a Spanish region) began on 20 July 2021 an aid recovery proceeding for
approximately €5 million, which the Group expects to appeal. No provision has been recorded by the
Group in connection with such decision.

  - On 1 October 2014, the EC issued a decision concluding that Retevisión and other terrestrial and satellite
platform operators had received state aid in the form of a €56.4 million scheme to finance the digitalisation
and extension of the terrestrial TV network in remote areas of Castile-La Mancha (a Spanish region) during
the digital switch-over process and that such state aid was incompatible with the EU rules. The decision
ordered the Kingdom of Spain through the regional government of Castile-La Mancha to recover the aid.
On 29 October 2015, the government of Castile-La Mancha began an aid recovery proceeding for €719
thousand, which the Group opposed and was declared lapsed ex officio in 4 July 2016. On 15 December
2016 the General Court of the European Union passed a ruling which dismissed the appeals. The Group
filed on 23 February 2017 an appeal with the European Court of Justice. On 26 April 2018 the European
Court of Justice issued a judgment dismissing the Group’s appeal, confirming the abovementioned
decision of the EC. Notwithstanding, the Kingdom of Spain also filed an appeal which was dismissed by
the European Court of Justice on 20 September 2018. On 26 November 2018, the government of CastileLa Mancha restarted the aid recovery proceeding for an amount of €719 thousand, which the Group paid
in the first half of 2019. On 7 February 2019, the government of Castile-La Mancha ruled in favour of the
aid recovery. The Group filed an appeal against the resolutions of the government of Castile-La Mancha,
which was dismissed by the High Court of Justice of Castile-La Mancha (Tribunal Superior de Justicia
_de Castilla-La Mancha) on 21 June 2021._

  - On 3 July 2018, the Guarantor received a notice from the Spanish authority of initiation of a tax audit for
the concepts corporate income tax (consolidated group), corresponding to the 2015 and 2016 fiscal years,
and value added tax, corresponding to the periods between April and December of 2015 (individual) and
2016 (VAT group). On 12 June 2020, the Guarantor signed “tax-assessment proposals in agreement” as
well as “assessments with previous agreement” regarding corporate income tax corresponding to fiscal
years 2015-2018. Regarding fiscal years 2015 and 2016, the referred tax assessment proposals are final.
In turn, the tax-assessment proposals for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 are provisional given that the tax
audits were limited to the verification of the income reduction derived from specific intangible assets. The
total amount of tax due is €3,072 thousand. The Board of Directors of the Guarantor has estimated that
the criteria applied by the tax authorities do not have a material impact on the years open to tax audit.
Furthermore, on 9 June 2020, the Guarantor signed, in disagreement, proposals of tax assessments
regarding value added tax. The tax-assessment proposals amount to €2,413 thousand. The purpose of the
value-added-tax audits is the regularisation of the consideration exchanged for the financial activities
carried out by the Guarantor and its effects in connection with the deductibility of value added tax. The
arguments put forward by Cellnex were not accepted and on 22 December 2020 final assessments were
communicated. In January 2021 Cellnex appealed the final assessments before the EconomicAdministrative Court and requested for the adjournment of the assessments by granting a bank guarantee
to the Spanish Tax Authorities. The tax authorities have considered that the Group’s approach was
reasonable and have expressly stated that no penalties should be imposed.

  - On 28 January 2020, the Irish tax authorities notified a tax visit in relation to corporate income tax and
VAT for fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2018. The first visit at Cellnex Ireland’s offices was originally

scheduled for 3 March 2020. However, due to the Coronavirus Pandemic it was postponed to 27 April
2021. The Group provided the Irish tax authorities with a set of information/documentation for their
analysis. In June 2021, the Irish tax authorities informed the Group of the completion of the review process
without further comments or requests.

  - At the beginning of 2020, the Swiss Tax Authorities notified the initiation of a tax audit in relation to
corporate income tax for fiscal years 2017 and 2018. In January 2021 the Swiss Tax Authorities closed the
audit process with no relevant impact for the Swiss companies of the Group.

  - In October 2020, the Italian tax authorities requested copies of certain transfer pricing documentation from
Cellnex Italy relating to fiscal year 2016. Following this request, in May 2021, the Italian tax authorities
and the Group met, and additional documentation was produced in response to requests from the Italian
tax authorities. The tax process remains open as of the date of this Base Prospectus. The Group does not
expect any material impact on the Group’s financial condition from the foregoing tax process.

### Regulation

 Telecom Infrastructure Services segment

At European level, there is a new common regulation as the European institutions agreed on the Directive (EU)
2018/1972 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 11 December 2018, that establishes the European
Electronic Communications Code (the “CODE” or the “EECC”). The EECC is meant to be the framework
regulation for the electronic communication services within the EU in the future, being ─among others─ the
umbrella for the 5G roll-out in Europe.

At national level, telecom acts are the laws regulating the electronic communications sector, including network
operations (the “Telecom Acts”), and with the exclusion of services regulated by audiovisual acts (the
“Audiovisual Acts”).

On a general basis, Telecom Acts provide an overall framework within which operators can develop their activity
based on the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and proportionality in order to promote free
competition and interoperable networks and services. The Telecom Acts also regulate ─among others and
depending on the jurisdiction─ the following aspects relevant to the development of the Group’s activity:

  - rights of operators and deployment of public electronic communications networks, which is the general
framework for the implementation and deployment of the networks;

  - infrastructure and public electronic communications networks in buildings (affects the reception of
broadcast services provided by the Group);

  - radio public domain, because the Group is required to verify that its customers have the authorisation
certificates needed to perform their activity;

  - taxes on telecommunications; and

  - inspection and sanction system.

The Member States were required to transpose the EECC into their national legal regimes, as Telecom Acts, by
21 December 2020. That means the passing of 28 new Telecom Acts in the EU or the modification of the existing
ones.

In Spain, the General Telecommunications Act (Law 9/2014, of 9 May) (the “GTA”) is the law establishing the
framework for the regulation of the electronic communications sector, including network operations and the
provision of electronic communications services and associated facilities.

The GTA implements the EU regulations on the matter in Spain, including, among others, (i) Directive
2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework
for electronic communications networks and services, as further amended; (ii) the Commission Recommendation
of 9 October 2014, on Relevant Product and Service Markets (2014/710/EC) (the “2014 Commission
**Recommendation”) regarding the relevant markets of products and services within the electronic**
communications sector that are eligible for ex ante regulation pursuant to Directive 2002/21/CE;, which has been
recently replaced by Commission Recommendation (EU) 2020/2245 of 18 December 2020 on relevant product
and service markets within the electronic communications sector susceptible to ex ante regulation in accordance
with Directive (EU) 2018/1972 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European
Electronic Communications Code (the “2020 Commission Recommendation”) and (iii) the Guidelines
2002/C165/03 on market analysis and the assessment of significant market power under the European regulatory
framework for electronic communications networks and services.

As to the process for the transposition of the EECC into the Spanish legal regime, the draft of new General
Telecommunications Act, which is the legal instrument intended to transpose the CODE, was published on 11
September 2020 (the “Draft GTA”). On that same date, the Spanish government launched a public consultation
for any interested party to comment on the Draft GTA, which ended on 13 October 2020. As of the date of this
Prospectus, the Spanish government has not finalized the implementation of the EECC Code into national
legislation, as the Draft GTA has not yet been passed.

Among the main changes introduced in the Spanish legislation by the Draft GTA, the Draft GTA intends to extend
its scope in order to include, among others, number-independent interpersonal communication services, as well
as the installation of public electronic communication networks. It modernizes the concept of universal service,
among others, by including a detailed list of services to which users shall have access through the service, and it
substantially reinforces users’ rights. It also reorganizes and reviews the rules applicable to the radio-electric
spectrum in order to facilitate the sharing of such use among operators and to stimulate the 5G network
development.

The Draft GTA, once approved, may introduce some amendments to the regulation applicable to some of the
activities of the Group. Among other things, the Draft GTA reinforces the regulation of “associated facilities”. In
this respect, along with others, article 9 of the Draft GTA ─following article 20 of the CODE─ sets forth the
obligation for companies installing and/or offering those associated facilities, as well as those installing or
providing associated services and digital infrastructures (including internet exchange points and data processing
centers), and any other agents in the market to provide the necessary information, including financial information,
to the corresponding authorities for the purposes identified in such article 9 (which include, among others,
compliance with the conditions set forth for the provision of services or the installation or exploitation of
electronic communication networks, and developing analysis in order to define the reference markets).

The Group is only subject to specific sector-related regulation in Portugal, where entities that hold or operate
passive hosting infrastructure used by telecom operators must comply with Decree-Law 123/2009 (the “Decree**Law”), according to which infrastructures shall be run as open platforms and, insofar as technically possible,**
access shall be granted to all telecom operators requesting access or use, under equalitarian, transparent and nondiscriminatory conditions. The Decree-Law also establishes a general cost orientation principle on remuneration
which will be further developed in a regulation to be issued by the Portuguese regulator (Autoridade Nacional de
_Comunicações or ANACOM). A draft of the regulation has already been prepared and was subject to public_
consultation but its final version is still pending.

### Broadcasting Infrastructure segment

The Broadcasting Infrastructure segment is also an “electronic communications segment” regulated by the EECC
and the respective Telecom Acts. In Spain, it is subject to the GTA which may be eventually modified in
accordance with the terms set forth in the Draft GTA.

**_European regulations_**

In order to promote competition in the provision of electronic communications networks and services and
following the prior European legislation, the EECC contemplates that national regulation authorities (“NRAs”)
shall carry out periodic market reviews consisting of three main steps:

  - _Relevant market definition: identify markets displaying characteristics, which may justify the imposition_
of ex ante regulatory obligations. Any market which satisfies the following three criteria in the absence of
regulation will be subject to ex ante regulation: barriers to entry, low tendency towards competition, and
insufficiency of ex post competition law remedies.

  - _SMP operators’ identification: NRAs must carry out an analysis of the relevant markets, taking into_
account the guidelines set by the European regulations. Where an NRA concludes that there is no effective
competition in a market, it must identify the operators with SMP in that market; and

  - _Imposition of ex ante obligations on the SMP operators in the market: taking into account the_
circumstances and particularities of the market, the NRA may impose the appropriate ex ante obligations
to attempt to ensure the maintenance of an effective competition in the analysed market.

The 2014 Commission Recommendation mentioned above identified in its annex the markets that shall require
an analysis by the NRAs. Those markets do not include the wholesale broadcasting transmission services,
identified as “Market 18” (a market in which the Group operates), as it was excluded from those that, prima facie,
require an analysis of the NRAs by the prior recommendation on this matter issued by the Commission
(Recommendation 2007/879/EC of 17 December 2007, the “2007 Commission Recommendation”). To reach
this conclusion the 2007 Commission Recommendation argued that:

  - significant changes were underway, with greater competition between platforms due to the transition from
analogue to digital TV;

  - certain obligations could solve platform accessibility problems that certain TV channels could face, so that
_ex ante regulation was no longer necessary; and_

  - the NRAs have the power to impose infrastructure sharing obligations without regulating the market.

The 2020 Commission Recommendation, which has replaced the 2014 Commission Recommendation, also
considers “Market 18” excluded from those markets that require an analysis by the NRAs.

In any case, NRAs maintain the capacity to apply the three criteria test established in the European regulations
to any electronic communications market in order to assess whether, on the basis of national circumstances, a
market not included in the 2020 Commission Recommendation might nonetheless still be subject to _ex ante_
regulation in a particular Member State of the EU.

The GTA contains, and the Draft GTA will contain, the standards to carry out market reviews under the terms
described therein.

**_Definition and market analysis of the television broadcasting transmission service_**

_Prior reviews of Market 18 declaring the Guarantor an SMP operator_

A44408936

## 124


-----

The CMT (before the creation of the CNMC) conducted three reviews of the Market 18, the audio visual market
according to Commission Recommendations, that were approved in 2006, 2009 and 2013.

In its resolutions of the Market 18, the market for broadcasting transmission services by terrestrial waves was
defined as that which “includes technical activities consistent in making available audio visual content produced
_by broadcasters to the public through telecommunication services as a distribution channel by means of_
_terrestrial waves”. Additionally, it geographically distinguished the following markets: (i) one national market;_
(ii) 19 regional markets corresponding to each of the territories of the autonomous communities and autonomous
cities; and (iii) 291 local geographical markets defined in terms of boundaries contained in the technical television
plan.

The CMT concluded in its resolutions that the market was non-competitive, susceptible to ex ante regulation and
therefore imposed certain obligations on Cellnex due to its deemed condition of being an SMP operator.

The CMT considered that there were certain high and non-transitory barriers to market entry in the broadcasting
transmission services market mainly because (i) sunk costs were particularly relevant in the market; (ii) there
were significant economies of scale that allow the historical operators to obtain relevant reductions in average
unit costs; (iii) the service required an infrastructure that is not easily reproducible and under which no alternative
supply is available; and (iv) the existence of legal obstacles to the occupation of the public domain for the
installation of networks.

_Latest review of Market 18 introducing flexibility to the obligations imposed to the Guarantor as an SMP operator_

On 6 October 2018, the CNMC published a public consultation process to analyse and carry out a further review
(the fourth) of the television broadcasting transmission market. With this new process, the CNMC aimed at
maintaining the Guarantor’s status as SMP operator while advocating for a more flexible regulatory framework
to foster the number of agreements to access the Guarantor’s infrastructure and, thus, increasing the number of
alternative suppliers for broadcasters. In particular, the proposal aimed (i) to replace the cost-oriented pricing
obligation by an obligation to set reasonable prices for access; (ii) to make equally available the access to colocation and interconnection to the Guarantor’s infrastructures; and (iii) to remove the obligation to publish the
Reference Offer for Access to Issuers Sites of Cellnex (Oferta de Referencia para el Acceso a los Centros
_emisores de Cellnex)._

After completion of the public consultation process on 7 November 2018 and receipt of observations or
suggestions from any third-party during such public consultation process, the CNMC published on 17 July 2019
its Resolution approving the definition and analysis of the wholesale market for the television broadcasting
transmission service (Market 18/2003) and notified to the European Commission and the European Electronic
Communications Regulators Entity (“CNMC Resolution 2019”). The CNMC Resolution 2019 entered into force
the day after its publication in the Spanish National Official Gazzette (Boletín Oficial del Estado), i.e. 25 July
2019.

The CNMC Resolution 2019 maintains the Guarantor’s status as SMP operator but introduces some flexibility in
the main obligations imposed on the Guarantor as briefly described herein below:

  - _Access to other operators. Obligation to provide access to the Guarantor’s national network of_
broadcasting centers to other operators. Generic obligation of access to the Guarantor’s sites which are
part of its DTT broadcasting network, by virtue of which the Guarantor will have to negotiate in good
faith the access of third-party operators to its centers, either in co-location and interconnection modes,
making equally available the access through both systems to Guarantor’s infrastructure. The Guarantor
shall not limit access based on the use to be made of its centers or the technology to be used by the
alternative operator, as far as the service to be provided consists on the broadcasting of television signals
or any related services such as transportation.

A44408936

## 125


-----

  - _Non-discrimination. The Guarantor shall apply equivalent conditions under similar circumstances to other_
operators that provide equivalent services. The Guarantor shall also provide to third parties services and
information of the same quality as those provided for its own services or to its affiliates, as well as to other
third-party operators.

  - _Transparency. The Guarantor shall provide to third parties a reference offer for the provision of the_
wholesale service, which must be sufficiently detailed in order to ensure that payment is not required for
resources that are not necessary for the service at stake. If the Guarantor modifies the offer, it shall inform
the CNMC. The CNMC may require the introduction of changes in the reference offer, according to article
69.2 of the EECC and article 7.3 of the Royal Decree 2296/2004, of 10 December, approving the
Regulation on electronic communications markets, network access and numbering (Real Decreto
_2296/2004, de 10 de diciembre, por el que se aprueba el Reglamento sobre mercados de comunicaciones_
_electrónicas, acceso a las redes y numeración). Article 18.1.a) of the Draft GTA, which intends to_
transpose into the Spanish legal regime article 69.2 of the EECC, does not expressly grant such discretion
to the CNMC. However, section 7 of that same article 18 states that a royal decree will be passed
identifying the specific obligations that the CNMC may impose in the referenced markets, which may
eventually include the granting of such power to the CNMC.

  - _Price Control. The Guarantor is subject to four obligations related with price control: (i) replacement of_
the cost-oriented pricing obligation by an obligation to set reasonable prices for the provision of access
services; in no case those prices shall be excessive or result in an operating margin squeeze preventing the
entry of an efficient operator into the market; in order to determine whether prices are reasonable, CNMC
will take into account the prices charged by the Guarantor to broadcasters for the provision of the
broadcasting service under comparable conditions and the additional costs to co-location and
interconnection services that an operator must incur in providing the broadcasting service to a broadcaster;
(ii) notwithstanding the suppression of the cost-oriented pricing obligation, the cost accounting and
separate accountability obligations remain as a source of ancillary information for the regulator in order
to determine whether Cellnex´s prices are reasonable; (iii) obligation to publish the prices for the access
services and their modifications in the reference offer; and (iv) obligation to communicate to the CNMC
the contracts with the broadcasters at a national level, and any amendment to those already in force.

**_The GTA regulation_**

In general, any natural or legal person who wants to provide services in the electronic communications market
must obtain the appropriate authorisation certificate. Each country manages their own certificates and has a sort
of registry for operators. The Group holds the necessary authorisation certificates for the transmission services of
signals using the radio spectrum (the only service offered by the electronic communications market) and it is
registered where it is necessary.

The spectrum used by wireless telecom networks (such as FM, DTT, mobile or PDDR, among others) is a scarce
resource that is managed and controlled by the competent organisations of the public administration in each
country. Specifically, although the allocation of the different uses of the spectrum is governed by general
principles applicable at the European and international level, member states of the EU (“Member States”) are
responsible for setting the frequency bands authorised for each of the applications. Specifically, in Spain the
Spanish Secretary of State for the Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructures (Secretaría de Estado de
_Telecomunicaciones e Infraestructuras Digitales or “SETID”) is responsible for this, ARCEP in France, OFCOM_
in the UK or AGCOM in Italy for instance. The frequency allocation is performed in the National Frequency
Allocation Tables, determining which frequencies are valid for each of the applications and the technical
conditions of use thereof.

A44408936

## 126


-----

The appropriate authorisation certificates required for the use of the radio spectrum for radio and television
broadcast are not held by the Group and are held by its clients (i.e. the different operators that provide final audio
visual services such as TV broadcasters, FM/AM radio broadcasters, etc.). The Group is required to verify that
its clients have those authorisation certificates prior to providing transmission and broadcasting service of the
signal.

**_Audio visual broadcasting services regulation_**

At the EU level, Directive 2010/13/EU on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or
administrative action in Member States concerning the provision of audio visual media services (the “Audio
**visual Media Services Directive”), as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/1808 of the European Parliament and**
the Council, approved on 14 November 2018 (the “Directive 2018/1808”) (jointly, the “AVMSD”) is meant to
be the framework for the audio visual services for the coming years, and will be the umbrella for the broadcasters
business. The Member States were required to transpose the AVMSD into their national legal regimes by 19
September 2020 and that means new Audiovisual Acts in most of the European countries or the modification of
the existing ones.

In Spain, the process for the transposition is still ongoing. A draft of a new General Audiovisual Communications
Act, which is the legal instrument intended to transpose such Directive, was published on 6 November 2020 (the
“Draft ACA”). The Government have opened public consultations and public audience processes and there is a
strong debate within the main stakeholders about the transposition. Due to the sensitivity of the new regulatory
framework and the transposition, it may be a complicated debate and it may take some time for the transposition
process to be completed.

Under the current Spanish Audio visual Communication Act (Law 7/2010, of 31 March) (the “ACA”), which
implemented the Audio visual Media Services Directive, radio and audio visual broadcasting services are general
interest services in Spain that can generally be provided in a competitive environment by anybody, subject to
prior notice to SETID, and only subject to the constraints derived from the limitations of the spectrum and the
protection of the interests of citizens. In any case, the audiovisual media services provided by the Spanish
Government, however, are considered a public service. The regime prior to the passing of the ACA, which was
based on administrative concessions, was substituted by a license regime by means of the ACA. Services
requiring the use of radio spectrum will have to follow a tender process to obtain the relevant licenses. These
licenses generally have terms of 15 years, with renewal mechanisms. The Draft ACA substantially maintains the
license regime established by the ACA. The changes proposed mainly apply to the procedure to obtain such
licenses.

The civil radio spectrum allocated to each DTT operator consists of a specific bandwidth that allows them to
broadcast one or more channels within a digital MUX. For audio visual content to reach viewers, DTT operators
need a broadcast network that carries the DTT signal from the DTT operators at production centers. This broadcast
network consists of a series of transmitters and relay stations where the transmission systems, infrastructure
telecommunications equipment, power cables, air conditioning and other equipment which are installed to enable
the DTT signal to be carried.

### Audio visual licenses granted to national DTT broadcasters in Spain require nearly complete coverage on population basis: a 96% population coverage requirement for commercial operators and a 98% population coverage requirement for public operators.

 Digital Dividend and UHF Band

The analogue switch-off (ASO) and the implementation of DTT in Spain were completed in April 2010. As a
consequence of its successful implementation and due to the DTT providing higher spectrum efficiency (more
and better services in less spectrum), the 800MHz band was allocated to mobile services on the so-called Digital

A44408936

## 127


-----

Dividend process which was completed on 2015. A second Digital Dividend, the 700MHz band, was envisaged
for 2020 (plus 2 years depending on the country) in all Europe, which has been delayed due to the Coronavirus
Pandemic, as explained below. A third Digital Dividend is not expected to take place in the foreseeable future as
per the Decision (EU) 2017/899 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2017, on the use of
the 470-790 MHz frequency band in the Union (the “UHF Decision”), by which the EU ensures the allocation
of the remaining spectrum for broadcasting services until, at least, 2030.

_First Digital Dividend, 800MHz band_

The Spanish government is responsible for the allocation of spectrum in Spain. On 24 September 2014, Royal
Decree 805/2014, of 19 September was published in the Official Gazette approving the National Technical Plan
for DTT (the “National Technical Plan for DTT”). Among other matters, this new Technical Plan allowed the
release of the so-called “Digital Dividend”, so that the 800 MHz band used by DTT was made available from
March 2015 to mobile operators which were awarded the frequencies through auctions conducted in 2011. As a
consequence of the reallocation of the frequencies, the number of MUXs available for DTT service was reduced
from eight to seven at national level and, on a general basis, from two to one at regional level.

On 17 April 2015, the Spanish government approved a resolution published in the Spanish Official Gazette on 18
April 2015 stating the basis for a public tender for the award of six new DTT national licenses: two standard
definition (SD) channels (one on the RGE2 MUX and the other on the MPE4 MUX), and three high definition
(HD) channels within a new MPE5 MUX. The licenses were awarded to: Grupo Secuoya, Kiss and 13TV (SD
licenses) and Mediaset, Atresmedia and Real Madrid (HD licenses). These new channels began their emissions
in April 2016.

_Second Digital Dividend, 700MHz band_

The World Radio Communication Conference 2015 (WRC 2015) held in Geneva during November 2015 made
important decisions on the UHF band:

  - _700MHz band (694 – 790MHz): the WRC15 agreed on the technical details in order to be used by_
electronic communication services and defined the co-primary allocation of the band to broadcast and
mobile services.

  - _Sub 700MHz band (470 – 694MHz): the WRC15 agreed on keeping the primary use of the band for DTT_
and to avoid any new debate about the use of the band until the World Radio Communication Conference
to be celebrated in 2023.

After the WRC Decision and several years of debate, the EU made its choice as per the mentioned UHF Decision
setting up the spectrum usage until 2030:

  - _700MHz band (the second Digital Dividend): Member States shall allow by 30 June 2020 the use of the_
700 MHz frequency band for terrestrial systems capable of providing wireless broadband electronic
communications services only under harmonised technical conditions established by the EC. Member
States may, however, delay allowing the use of the 700 MHz frequency band for up to two years on the
basis of one or more of the duly justified reasons set out in the EC’s decision.

  - _Sub 700MHz band: Member States shall ensure availability at least until 2030 of the sub-700 MHz_
frequency band for the terrestrial provision of broadcasting services, including free television, and for the
use by wireless audio PMSE (programme-making and special events) on the basis of national needs, while
taking into account the principle of technological neutrality. Member States shall ensure that any other use
of the sub-700 MHz frequency band on their territory is compatible with the national broadcasting needs
in the relevant Member State and does not cause harmful interference to, or claim protection from, the
terrestrial provision of broadcasting services in a neighbouring Member State.

A44408936

## 128


-----

In addition, no later than 30 June 2018, Member States were requested to adopt and publish their respective
national plan and schedule (“national roadmap”), including detailed steps for fulfilling their obligations as set out
above. Member States had to draw up their national roadmaps after consulting all relevant stakeholders.

The Spanish government published on 29 June 2018 its national roadmap for the liberalisation of the second
Digital Dividend after several public consultations, which was originally expected to conclude by 30 June 2020,
following the EU calendar. A massive consensus among relevant stakeholders (including both the
telecommunication and broadcasting sectors) on the need for a non-disruptive transition and on keeping the DTT
competitively by ensuring the current number of MUXs, drove the process. Among the main milestones of the
roadmap calendar, it was declared that several legal instruments were to be approved by the end of 2018 in order,
among others, to approve the new National Technical Plan for DTT, and to approve a compensation regime for
the costs of adaptation of reception facilities to new frequencies and to compensate the forced updates in
broadcasters’ transmission equipment.

As a consequence, on 21 June 2019, the Spanish government passed Royal Decree 391/2019 approving the new
National Technical Plan for DTT and the regulation of certain aspects of the liberalisation of the second Digital
Dividend.

This Royal Decree regulates how the 700 MHz band will be liberalized and how the radio-electric channels and
the new digital MUXs will be distributed among the Spanish Public Radio and Television Corporation and other
license holders, obligations of minimum range of reception and the technical specifications that the television
services have to meet. The current number of MUXs (and their coverages) on the sub 700MHz band will be
maintained, as well as the offer of DTT channels. The Royal Decree also states that the 700 MHz band shall not
be used by audio visual communication service providers by 30 June 2020, in order to make it available for the
5G mobile services from that date onwards. The Royal Decree further establishes that the sub-700 MHz will
continue to be used for television broadcasting until, at least, 2030.

On the same date, the Spanish government approved Royal Decree 392/2019, which regulates the direct granting
of subsidies to compensate the costs in the reception of or access to television audio visual communication
services in buildings, as a consequence of the liberalization of frequency bands in the range 694-790 MHz (the
second Digital Dividend).

The subsidies are granted to homeowners associations and will be affected to compensate for costs and
investments arising from the necessary actions in order to ensure the reception of or the access to the television
communication services in buildings affected by the liberalization of the second Digital Dividend. The
abovementioned actions have to respect the principle of technological neutrality, in a way that does not favor a
particular platform. The beneficiaries may choose any available technology allowing reception of or access to the
audio visual television services in the affected buildings. The concession of the subsidies will be carried out by
the public entity Red.es and will be made by a direct concession procedure, in view of the exceptional nature of
the process of liberalization of the second Digital Dividend, involving the relocation of numerous public and
private television channels, and the existence of reasons of public and social interest consisting in avoiding the
loss of access to the television services for a part of the Spanish population, until the adaptation of their reception
equipment is completed.

A few months later, the Spanish government passed Royal Decree 579/2019, of 11 October, which regulates the
direct granting of subsidies to public audio visual television service providers at national and regional levels, for
the purpose of compensating the costs arising from the simultaneous and transitory emission of their TV channels
during the process of liberalization of the second Digital Dividend.

This Royal Decree (i) declares as service of general economic interest the simultaneous and transitory
broadcasting by public audio visual television service providers of their channels in the frequencies affected by

A44408936

## 129


-----

the second Digital Dividend and, as a consequence, (ii) grants subsidies, of up to €10 million, to compensate the
costs arising from the simulcast during the transitory period.

In this same context, the Spanish government passed Royal Decree 706/2020, of 28 July, which rules the direct
granting of subsidies to private providers of television audiovisual communication services for the purpose of
compensating the costs derived from the changes to be made in their transmission equipment for its adaptation
to the new planned frequencies as per the process of liberalization of band 700 MHz (second Digital Dividend).
The total amount of subsidies shall not exceed €10 million. A list of potential beneficiaries of these subsidies is
listed in an Annex to the regulation.

On that same date, Royal Decree 707/2020, of 28 July, that governs the direct concession of subsidies to providers
of the public service of television audiovisual communication at a national and regional level, for the purpose of
compensating the costs derived from the simultaneous and transitory emission of their tv channels during the
process of liberalisation for the frequency band 694-790 MHz (second Digital Dividend) between 1 July 2020
and 30 September 2020, and that modifies Royal Decree 392/2019, was passed. This Royal Decree governs the
process of granting those subsidies up to a total amount of €5,193,750. The granting process is to be followed
before the public entity Red.es.

Due to the sanitary crisis caused by the Coronavirus Pandemic, the Spanish government declared the state of
alarm by means of Royal Decree 463/2020, of 14 March. In this context, the government decided to temporarily
postpone (not suspend) the execution of the pending phases for the implementation of the liberalisation of the
second Digital Dividend. As explained by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation, in a
press note released on 30 March 2020, the above measures had been communicated to the European Commission.
Notwithstanding the above, due to the ending of the state of emergency on 21 June 2020, the Spanish Council of
Ministers of 23 June 2020 extended the deadline for the implementation of the release of the second Digital
Dividend until 31 October 2020 (by means of Royal Decree-Law 23/2020). The release of the second Digital
Dividend was fully completed by such date. Furthermore, it was agreed that the simulcast emissions
(simultaneous emission of a TV channel through the new and old frequencies) were to be maintained until 30
September 2020, in order to facilitate the adaptation of users’ facilities to the reception of the new planned
frequencies.

The bidding for the allocation of 700Mhz frequency bands for 5G services has been set on the first trimester of
2021. The Spanish government launched on 15 December 2020 a public consultation on the conditions to apply
to the 5G frequency auction process, which ended on 17 January 2021.

Also, while the bidding for the allocation of 700Mhz frequency bands for 5G services was to occur on the first
quarter of 2021, it has only been called on 26 May 2021, by virtue of the Ministerial Order ETD/534/2021, which
sets that the auction shall begin by 21 July 2021. The duration of these concessions will be 20 years, renewable
for another 20 years, as provided by the recent amendment of the GTA by virtue of Royal Decree Law 7 2021, of
27 April. Furthermore, the bidding of the 3.5Ghz band which also affects the development of 5G, was carried out
in February 2021.

With regards to 5G, a further draft of an act ruling security in 5G electronic communications networks and
services (the “Draft 5G Cybersecurity”) was published by the Spanish government on 14 December 2020. Also,
a public hearing and information process was initiated for any individuals or entities wishing to comment on the
document, which ended on 14 January 2021.

The scope of this the Draft 5G Cybersecurity, which is one of the initiatives contained in the Digital Spain 2025
Plan (seeking, among others, to promote the full implementation of high-speed and ultra-fast networks in Spain),
is to create a safe and reliable framework for the development of and investment in 5G technology. For that
purpose, it establishes measures to be adopted by 5G networks and service operators, distributors of hardware
and software for 5G (including providers of services for the functioning of 5G services), manufacturers and

entities providing connected terminal equipment and devices, and certain corporate users (with the right to use
the radioelectric public domain for exploiting networks or for the self-provision of capacities based on 5G
technology), in order to safely deploy those new electronic communication networks.

### Other Network Services segment

The activities undertaken by the Group in its Other Network Services segment are not subject to specific sectorrelated regulation.

### Competition Law

Practices restricting competition are prohibited in the EU under applicable competition regulations. Such
practices include, among others, (i) the abuse of a dominant position and (ii) prohibited collusive agreements or
concerted practices.

The prohibition of competition-restricting practices is the result of both EU and national law. European and
national competition laws (articles 101 and 102 of the TFEU and articles 1 and 2 of the LDC, as well as
implementing regulations) regulate these practices in a similar manner. In general, EU laws regulate any
prohibited practices that may affect trade between Member States, and national laws regulate practices that have
a domestic effect.

If the relevant competition authorities (generally the EC on the European level, and the national competition
authority in each relevant Member State on the national level, as well as, in the case of Spain, certain regional
authorities in their jurisdictions) determine that a company has abused its dominant position or is party to a
prohibited agreement, they may order the Group to cease such anticompetitive practices and/or impose sanctions
which may include fines. Fines imposed by the EC are computed on the basis of the revenues obtained in the
affected market by the offending company and capped at 10% of the total consolidated revenues obtained by the
group of the offending company (companies sharing a common control structure) in the year preceding the
decision. In the case of Spain, fines imposed by the CNMC or the regional authorities are computed as up to a
10% of the total consolidated revenues obtained by the offending company in the year preceding the decision (in
case of an anticompetitive agreement or concerted practice between competitors or an abuse of dominance by a
monopolist or quasi-monopolist or a company enjoying special rights) or up to 5% (in case of an anticompetitive
agreement or concerted practice between non-competitors or other instances abuse of dominance).

Actions constituting abuse of a dominant position, or any clauses in agreements prohibited by the competition
regulations, are void and therefore not enforceable. Engaging in competition-restricted practices may trigger the
filing of civil claims by third parties that suffered an economic loss as a result thereof.

The competition regulations prohibit as especially serious infringements any agreement or concerted practice
between competitors aimed at price fixing, either directly or indirectly, or other relevant commercial conditions,
limiting production, allocation of markets or customers, or boycott to third parties.

The competition regulations also prohibit certain practices in connection with the supplier-customer relationship.
In this case, there are no absolute prohibitions (other certain hardcore restrictions related to the fixing of resale
prices and limits as to where or to whom the customer may resale the products) as they depend on the market
share of the parties, duration of the clauses and characteristics of the restrictions of competition.

Regarding the abuse of a dominant position, the Group must enjoy a dominant position in the market affected by
the practice as a pre-condition. Thus, before examining whether a specific conduct is abusive, it is necessary to
determine the relevant market and the Group’s position in such market. Defining the relevant market is of great
importance because it determines the Group’s position in the market. This definition must be done from two
perspectives: product/service and geographical. It is therefore crucial to assess the substitutability between goods
and services and the homogeneity of competition conditions between regions.

A44408936

## 131


-----

A dominant position is defined as a position of economic or commercial strength that enables a party to behave
independently of its suppliers, competitors and customers. There is no legal definition of dominant position under
EU and national regulations, however there are different criteria that are used to assess whether such a position
exists or not. The main such criterion is market share which gives an indication of the existence of dominance.
In this regard, market shares below 40% entail a presumption that there is no dominance. In any event, the
particular circumstances applicable to each case should be carefully analysed.

Abuse may take different forms. Article 102 of the TFEU and its national equivalent list the most important: (i)
application of non-equitable prices or other trading conditions or services; (ii) limiting production, distribution
or technical development to the unreasonable detriment of companies or consumers; (iii) unjustified refusal to
satisfy purchases of products or services demands; (iv) applying discriminatory conditions to commercially
equivalent situations, which places some competitors at a disadvantage compared to others; or (v) the
subordination of certain services to contracting others that are not related to them.

As per the nature of its business, the sharing of infrastructures, the behaviour of the Group is to promote
competition, especially given that the fast and efficient roll-out of the upcoming 5G technology is a cross-cutting
key priority for the EC in order to ensure the European industry’s competitiveness in an increasingly digital
society.

In this regard, recent European developments on the telecom and infrastructures markets are pointing to the
benefit of the citizen and the roll-out of telecom networks acquiring a more prominent role as legal interests that
deserve being protected by means of competition regulations enforcement. So, more attention to efficiencies that
actually benefit telecom customers in the competition and regulatory examinations might be expected (as for
instance in the EC’s decision of 6 March 2020, case M.9674 Vodafone Italia/TIM/INWIT JV and the General
Court of the EU’s judgement of May 28, 2020, case T-399/16 CK Telekoms UK Investments v Commission).

### Risks associated with the regulations that govern the Group and its business

Without prejudice to the above, the business of the Group and those of its customers are subject to the national,
regional and local regulations of all jurisdictions in which the Group operates as well as the regulatory framework
applicable in the EU. The existing laws or regulations under which the Group operates may be repealed, amended
or overruled, and new regulations may be promulgated at any time. Such regulations could be applied or enforced
retroactively or the interpretation of such regulations by the competent authority may differ from that of the
Group. The Group cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations, including national, regional and
local tax laws, will not adversely affect the Group’s business, generate delays in its projects or result in additional
costs.

Failure to comply with applicable regulations may lead to civil penalties or require the Group to assume
indemnification obligations or result in the Group breaching certain of its contractual provisions. Furthermore, if
applicable laws and regulations are not enforced equally against its competitors in a particular market, the
compliance with such laws and regulations may put the Group at a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis competitors
who do not have to comply with such requirements.

Moreover, the Group cannot guarantee that the interpretation of applicable laws or regulations will coincide with
the one of the relevant governmental agencies or courts enforcement of such laws or regulations. These factors
may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition
and cash flows.

The Group depends on the obtaining, maintaining and periodically renewing of several licenses, authorizations,
and administrative and regulatory permits in all jurisdictions where the Group operates. The Group is unable to
assure that such licenses, authorizations and permits will be fully granted at all times or renewed upon their

A44408936

## 132


-----

expiration. Also, most of the industries in which the Group’s customers operate also require the application for
licenses or authorizations, as well as adjudication/concession and renewal processes beyond the Group’s control.

There can be no assurance that breaches of any applicable regulations have not occurred or will not occur or be
identified or that these laws will not change in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on
the business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the Group.

### TAXATION

The following is a general description of certain Spanish tax considerations relating to the Notes. It does not
purport to be a complete analysis of all tax considerations relating to the Notes, whether in those countries or
elsewhere. Prospective purchasers of Notes should consult their own tax advisers as to which countries’ tax laws
could be relevant to acquiring, holding and disposing of Notes and receiving payments of interest, principal and/or
other amounts under the Notes and the consequences of such actions under the tax laws of those countries. This
summary is based upon the law as in effect on the date of this Base Prospectus and is subject to any change in
law that may take effect after such date.

### Taxation in Spain

_The following is a general description of certain Spanish tax considerations. The information provided below_
_does not purport to be a complete summary of tax law and practice currently applicable in the Kingdom of Spain_
_and is subject to any changes in law and the interpretation and application thereof, which could be made with_
_retroactive effect._

### Introduction

The information provided below does not purport to be a complete analysis of the tax law and practice currently
applicable in Spain, and it is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal or tax advice, and does not
address all the tax consequences applicable to all categories of investors, some of which (such as look through
entities, pension funds, undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities or holders of the Notes
by reason of employment) may be subject to special rules. This analysis is a general description of the tax
treatment under the Spanish legislation currently in force in the common territory of Spain and, hence, it does not
indicate the tax treatment applicable under the regional tax regimes in the Historical Territories of the Basque
Country and the Community of Navarre, or under the provisions passed by Autonomous Communities which
may apply to specific investors for specific taxes. References in this section to holders include the beneficial
owners of the Notes, where applicable.

In December 2020, Law 11/2020, of 30 December, on the General State Budget for 2021 (“Budget Law for
**2021”) was approved by the Spanish parliament. The Budget Law for 2021 includes a set of tax measures with**
effects as of 1 January 2021 that will have a significant impact on the current Spanish taxation system resulting
in a general increase in tax liabilities, including in relation to the Notes. The approved tax measures affect the
various taxes in the Spanish tax system and therefore these new changes will be detailed throughout the following
sections as appropriate (please note that not all tax measures introduced by the Budget Law for 2021 will be
described but only those relevant for the purposes of taxation of the Notes).

This information has been prepared in accordance with the following Spanish tax legislation in force at the date
of this Base Prospectus:

If:

(a) of general application, Additional Provision One of Law 10/2014, of 26 June on the management,
supervision and solvency of credit institutions (“Law 10/2014”), as well as Royal Decree 1065/2007
(“Royal Decree 1065/2007”), of 27 July, as amended by Royal Decree 1145/2011 of July 29 (“Royal
**Decree 1145/2011”), establishing information obligations in relation to preferential holdings and other**
debt instruments and certain income obtained by individuals resident in the EU and other tax rules;

(b) for individuals with tax residency in Spain who are personal income tax (“Personal Income Tax”)
taxpayers, Law 35/2006, of 28 November on Personal Income Tax and on the partial amendment of the
Corporate Income Tax Law, Non Residents Income Tax Law and Wealth Tax Law as amended, (the
“Personal Income Tax Law”), and Royal Decree 439/2007, of 30 March, promulgating the Personal

A44408936

## 136


-----

Income Tax Regulations as amended by, along with Law 19/1991, of 6 June on Wealth Tax as amended
(the “Wealth Tax Law”) and Law 29/1987, of 18 December, on Inheritance and Gift Tax as amended (the
“Inheritance and Gift Tax Law”);

(c) for legal entities resident for tax purposes in Spain which are corporate income tax (“Corporate Income
**Tax”) taxpayers, Law 27/2014, of 27 November, of the Corporate Income Tax Law, and Royal Decree**
634/2015, of 10 July, promulgating the Corporate Income Tax Regulations as amended (the “Corporate
**Income Tax Regulations”); and**

(d) for individuals and legal entities who are not resident for tax purposes in Spain and are non-resident
income tax (“Non-Resident Income Tax”) taxpayers, Royal Legislative Decree 5/2004, of 5 March,
promulgating the Consolidated Text of the Non-Resident Income Tax Law, and Royal Decree 1776/2004,
of 30 July, promulgating the Non-Resident Income Tax Regulations as amended, along with Law 19/1991,
of 6 June, on Wealth Tax, as amended and Law 29/1987, of 18 December, on Inheritance and Gift Tax, as
amended.

Whatever the nature and residence of the holder of a beneficial interest in the Notes (each, a “Beneficial Owner”),
the acquisition and transfer of the Notes will be exempt from indirect taxes in Spain, for example exempt from
transfer tax and stamp duty, in accordance with the consolidated text of such tax promulgated by Royal Legislative
Decree 1/1993, of 24 September, and exempt from value added tax, in accordance with Law 37/1992, of 28
December, regulating such tax and article 314 of the Consolidated Text of the Spanish Securities Market Law
and related provisions.

**1** **Individuals with Tax Residency in Spain**

**1.1** **Personal Income Tax (Impuesto sobre la Renta de las Personas Físicas)**

Both interest periodically received and income deriving from the transfer, redemption or repayment of the
Notes would constitute a return on investment obtained from the transfer of own capital to third parties in
accordance with the provisions of Section 25.2 of the Personal Income Tax Law, and should be included
in each investor’s taxable savings and taxed at the tax rate applicable from time to time, currently at the
rate of 19% for taxable income up to €6,000; 21% for taxable income between €6,000.01 to €50,000, 23%
for taxable income between €50,000 and €200,000, and 26% for taxable income in excess €200,000.
Please note that the Budget Law for 2021 has introduced a new tax range in the scale, effective as of 1
January 2021 and with indefinite duration, according to which income exceeding €200,000 will be taxed
at a flat rate of 26%.

As a general rule, both types of income are subject to a withholding tax on account at the rate of 19%.
However, according to Section 44.5 of Royal Decree 1065/2007, of 27 July, the Issuer will make interest
payments to individual holders who are resident for tax purposes in Spain without withholding provided
that the relevant information about the Notes set out in Annex I is submitted by the Fiscal Agent in a timely
manner.

Notwithstanding the above, withholding tax at the applicable rate of 19% may have to be deducted by
other entities (such as depositaries, institutions or financial entities) provided that such entities are resident
for tax purposes in Spain or have a permanent establishment in Spanish territory.

In any event, individual holders may credit the withholding against their Personal Income Tax liability for
the relevant fiscal year and may be refundable pursuant to Section 103 of the Personal Income Tax Law.

A44408936

## 137


-----

**1.2** **Reporting Obligations**

The Issuer and the Guarantor will comply with the reporting obligations set out in the Spanish tax laws
with respect to Noteholders who are individuals resident in Spain for tax purposes.

**1.3** **Wealth Tax (Impuesto sobre el Patrimonio)**

Individuals with tax residency in Spain are subject to Wealth Tax to the extent that their net worth exceeds
€700,000 (subject to any exceptions provided under relevant legislation in an autonomous region
(Comunidad _Autónoma)). Therefore, they should take into account the value of the Notes which they hold_
as at 31 December in each year, the applicable rates ranging between 0.2% and 3.5%. Please note that with
effects as of 1 January 2021, the highest tax rate of the Net Wealth Tax has been increased by the Budget
Law for 2021 from 2.5. per cent to 3.5 per cent. for taxable bases in excess of €10,695,996.06. However,
the final tax rates may vary depending on any applicable regional tax laws, and some reductions may
apply.

With effects as of 1 January 2008, a 100 per cent. tax relief (bonificación del 100%) on Net Wealth Tax
was enforced. However, the Spanish Central Government provisionally repealed the 100 per cent. relief
of this tax for years 2011 and 2012. This provisional measure had however been yearly extended, until
December 2020. As of 2021, the 100 per cent. relief on the Net Wealth Tax has definitively been repealed
by the Budget Law for 2021 (so that the repeal of the tax relief will no longer have to be extended every
year). The actual collection of this tax depends on the regulations of each Autonomous Region.

**1.4** **Inheritance and Gift Tax (Impuesto sobre Sucesiones y Donaciones)**

Individuals with tax residency in Spain who acquire ownership or other rights over any Notes by
inheritance, gift or legacy will be subject to inheritance and gift tax in accordance with the applicable
Spanish regional or state rules. As of the date of this Base Prospectus, the applicable tax rates currently
range between 7.65% and 81.6% depending on the relevant factors (such as previous net wealth or family
relationship between the transferor and transferee) although the final tax rate may vary depending on any
applicable regional tax laws.

**2** **Legal Entities with Tax Residency in Spain**

**2.1** **Corporate Income Tax (Impuesto sobre Sociedades)**

Both interest periodically received and income deriving from the transfer, redemption or repayment of the
Notes must be included in the taxable income of legal entities with tax residency in Spain and will be
subject to Corporate Income Tax (CIT) at the current general rate of 25% following the rules for this tax.

No withholding on account of CIT will be imposed on interest or on income derived from the redemption
or repayment of the Notes by the Issuer, by Spanish CIT taxpayers, provided that certain requirements
(including certain formalities to be complied with by the Fiscal Agent described in “—Information about
_the Notes in connection with Payments”, below) are met._

However, in the case of Notes held by Spanish resident entity and deposited with a Spanish resident entity
acting as depositary or custodian, payments of interest and income obtained upon the transfer of the Notes
may be subject to withholding tax at the current rate of 19%, withholding that will be made by the
depositary or custodian, if the Notes do not comply with the exemption requirements specified in the
ruling issued by the Spanish Tax Authorities (Dirección General de Tributos) dated 27 July 2004 and
require a withholding to be made.

Notwithstanding the above, amounts withheld, if any, may be credited by the relevant investors against its
final CIT liability.

A44408936

-----

**2.2** **Reporting Obligations**

The Issuer and the Guarantor will comply with the reporting obligations set out in the Spanish tax laws
with respect to Noteholders who are legal persons or entities resident in Spain for tax purposes.

**2.3** **Wealth Tax (Impuesto sobre el Patrimonio)**

Spanish resident legal entities are not subject to Wealth Tax.

**2.4** **Inheritance and Gift Tax (Impuesto sobre Sucesiones y Donaciones)**

Legal entities with tax residency in Spain which acquire ownership or other rights over the Notes by
inheritance, gift or legacy are not subject to inheritance and gift tax and must include the market value of
the Notes in their taxable income for Spanish CIT purposes.

**3** **Individuals and Legal Entities with no Tax Residency in Spain**

**3.1** **Non-Resident Income Tax (Impuesto sobre la Renta de No Residentes)**

(a) Non-Spanish resident investors acting through a permanent establishment in Spain

Ownership of the Notes by investors who are not resident for tax purposes in Spain will not in itself
create the existence of a permanent establishment in Spain.

If the Notes form part of the assets of a permanent establishment in Spain of a person or legal entity
who is not resident in Spain for tax purposes, the tax rules applicable to income deriving from such
Notes are the same as those for Spanish CIT taxpayers.

(b) Non-Spanish resident investors not acting through a permanent establishment in Spain

Both interest periodically received and income deriving from the transfer, redemption or repayment
of the Notes, obtained by individuals or entities who have no tax residency in Spain, and which are
Non- Resident Income Tax (“NRIT”) taxpayers with no permanent establishment in Spain, are
exempt from such NRIT and also from withholding tax on account of NRIT provided certain
requirements are met.

In order for such exemption to apply it is necessary to comply with the information procedures, in
the manner detailed under “Information about the Notes in connection with Payments” as set out
in article 44 of Royal Decree 1065/2007.

**3.2** **Reporting Obligations**

The Issuer and the Guarantor will comply with the reporting obligations set out in the Spanish tax laws
with respect to Noteholders who are individuals or legal entities not resident in Spain for tax purposes
who act with respect to the Notes through a permanent establishment in Spain or not.

**3.3** **Wealth Tax (Impuesto sobre el Patrimonio)**

Spanish non-resident tax individuals are subject to Wealth Tax, which imposes a tax on property and rights
in excess of €700,000 that are located in Spain, or can be exercised within the Spanish territory, on the last
day of any year.

However, to the extent that income derived from the Notes is exempt from NRIT, individual Noteholders
not resident in Spain for tax purposes that hold Notes on the last day of any year will be exempt from
Wealth Tax. Furthermore, Noteholders who benefit from a convention for the avoidance of double taxation
with respect to wealth tax that provides for taxation only in the Noteholder’s country of residence will not
be subject to Wealth Tax.

A44408936

## 139


-----

If the provisions of the foregoing paragraph do not apply, non-Spanish tax resident individuals whose net
worth related to property located, or rights that can be exercised, in Spain is above €700,000 and who hold
Notes on the last day of any year would therefore be subject to Wealth Tax for such year at marginal rates
varying between 0.2% and 3.5% of the average market value of the Notes during the last quarter of such
year, although some reductions may apply (please note that, as mentioned above, the Budget Law for 2021
has introduced a new tax range in the scale with a maximum tax rate of 3.5 per cent for taxable income
over €10,695,996.06).

Non-Spanish tax resident individuals who are resident in an EU or European Economic Area member
State may apply the rules approved by the autonomous region where the assets and rights with more value
are situated. As such, prospective investors should consult their tax advisers.

With effects as of 1 January 2008, a 100 per cent. tax relief (bonificación del 100%) on Net Wealth Tax
was enforced. However, the Spanish Central Government provisionally repealed the 100 per cent. relief
of this tax for years 2011 and 2012. This provisional measure had however been yearly extended, until
December 2020. As of 2021, the 100 per cent. relief on the Net Wealth Tax has definitively been repealed
by the Budget Law for 2021 (so that the repeal of the tax relief will no longer have to be extended every
year).

Non-Spanish resident legal entities are not subject to Wealth Tax.

**3.4** **Inheritance and Gift Tax (Impuesto sobre Sucesiones y Donaciones)**

Individuals who do not have tax residency in Spain who acquire ownership or other rights over the Notes
by inheritance, gift or legacy, and who reside in a country with which Spain has entered into a double tax
treaty in relation to inheritance and gift tax will be subject to the relevant double tax treaty.

If the provisions of the foregoing paragraph do not apply, such individuals will be subject to inheritance
and gift tax in accordance with Spanish legislation.

Generally, non-Spanish tax resident individuals are subject to the Spanish Inheritance and Gift Tax
according to the rules set forth in the Spanish State level law. However, if the deceased or the donee are
resident in an EU or European Economic Area Member State, the applicable rules will be those
corresponding to the relevant Spanish autonomous regions in accordance with the law. In addition, if the
deceased or the donee is resident outside an EU or European Economic Area Member State, the relevant
autonomous regions rules might be applicable pursuant to recent rulings issued by the EU Courts and the
Spanish Supreme Court (judgments of 19 February, 21 March and 22 March 2018). As such, prospective
investors should consult their tax advisers.

Non-Spanish resident legal entities which acquire ownership or other rights over the Notes by inheritance,
gift or legacy are not subject to inheritance and gift tax. They will be subject to NRIT. If the legal entity
is resident in a country with which Spain has entered into a double tax treaty, the provisions of such treaty
will apply. In general, double-tax treaties provide for the taxation of this type of income in the country of
residence of the beneficiary.

**4** **Payments made by the Guarantor**

Any payments of principal and interest made by the Guarantor under the Guarantee may be characterised as an
indemnity and, accordingly, be made free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for, any taxes,
duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatsoever nature imposed, levied, collected, withheld or
assessed by Spain or any political subdivision or authority thereof or therein having power to tax.

A44408936

## 140

However, although no clear precedent, statement of law or regulation exists in relation thereto, in the event that
the Spanish Tax Authorities take the view that the Guarantor has validly, legally and effectively assumed all the
obligations of the Issuer under the Notes subject to and in accordance with the Guarantee. In such circumstances,
the Spanish tax authorities may determine that payments made by the Guarantor will be subject to the same tax
rules set out above for payments made by the Issuer.

**5** **Information about the Notes in connection with Payments**

In accordance with Section 44 of Royal Decree 1065/2007, certain information with respect to the Notes must be
submitted to the Issuer before the close of business on the Business Day (as defined in the Conditions of the
Notes) immediately preceding the date on which any payment of interest, principal or of any amounts in respect
of the early redemption of the Notes (each, a “Payment Date”) is due.

Such information would be the following:

(a) identification of the Notes (as applicable) in respect of which the relevant payment is made;

(b) date on which the relevant payment is made;

(c) the total amount of the relevant payment of income; and

(d) the amount of the relevant payment paid to each entity that manages a clearing and settlement system for
securities situated outside Spain.

In particular, the Fiscal Agent must certify the information above about the Notes by means of a certificate the
form of which is attached as Annex I of this Base Prospectus.

In light of the above, the Issuer and the Fiscal Agent have arranged certain procedures to facilitate the collection
of information concerning the Notes by the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding each
relevant Payment Date.

If, despite these procedures, the relevant information is not timely received by the Issuer, the Issuer will withhold
tax at the then-applicable rate (currently 19%) from any payment in respect of the relevant Notes. The Issuer will
not pay any additional amounts with respect to any such withholding.

If, before the tenth calendar day of the month following the relevant payment date, the Fiscal Agent provides the
required information, the Issuer will reimburse the amounts withheld.

Investors who are not resident in Spain for tax purposes and are entitled to exemption from NRIT on income
derived from the Notes, but where the Issuer does not timely receive from the Fiscal Agent the information above
about the Notes by means of a certificate the form of which is attached as Annex I of this Base Prospectus, would
have to apply directly to the Spanish tax authorities for any refund to which they may be entitled, according to
the procedures set forth in the Spanish NRIT Law.

Investors should note that none of the Issuer, the Guarantor or the Fiscal Agent accepts any responsibility relating
to the procedures established for the collection of information concerning the Notes. Accordingly, the Issuer, the
Guarantor and the Fiscal Agent will not be liable for any damage or loss suffered by any holder who would
otherwise be entitled to an exemption from Spanish withholding tax but whose income payments are nonetheless
paid net of Spanish withholding tax because these procedures prove ineffective. Moreover, the Issuer and the
Guarantor will not pay any additional amounts with respect to any such withholding. See Risk Factors “Risks
_related to the Spanish withholding tax regime”, above._

The procedures for providing documentation referred to in this section are set out in detail in the Agency
Agreement.

### The proposed financial transactions tax (FTT)

On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published the Commission’s Proposal for a Directive for a
common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and
Slovakia. However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate in the Commission’s Proposal.

The Commission’s Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the
Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. The issuance and subscription of
Notes should, however, be exempt. The mechanism by which the tax would be applied and collected is not yet
known, but if the proposed directive or any similar tax is adopted, transactions in the Notes would be subject to
higher costs, and the liquidity of the market for the Instruments may be diminished.

Under the Commission’s Proposal, FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside
of the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one
party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a Participating Member State. A financial
institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a Participating Member State in a broad range of
circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a Participating Member State or (b)
where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a Participating Member State.

However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States and the
scope of any such tax is uncertain. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which
remains unclear as of the date of this Base Prospectus. Participating Member States may decide to withdraw
and additional EU Member States may decide to participate. Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to
seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT and its potential impact on the Notes.

### Spanish FTT

The Spanish law implementing the Spanish FTT was approved on 7 October 2020 (the “FTT Law”) and was
published in the Spanish Official Gazette (Boletín Oficial del Estado) on 16 October 2020. The Spanish FTT
came into force three months after the publication of the FTT Law in the Spanish Official Gazette (that is, on
16 January 2021).

The Spanish FTT is aligned with the French and Italian financial transactions tax. Specifically, the Spanish FTT
is an indirect tax levied at a tax rate of 0.2 per cent. on the acquisitions for consideration of shares issued by
Spanish companies regardless of the residency of the parties involved in the transaction, or of the jurisdiction
where the shares are traded, provided that they comply with the following conditions: (i) the shares should be
admitted to trading on a regulated market under Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments (or in a foreign market declared equivalent by the
European Commission), and (ii) the stock market capitalization value of the company should exceed €1,000
million. The Spanish FTT will be payable on a monthly basis.

However, according to the Spanish FTT Law, the Spanish FTT should not apply in relation to an issue of Notes
under the Programme.

Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

### U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Withholding

Pursuant to certain provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commonly known as
FATCA, a “foreign financial institution” may be required to withhold on certain payments it makes (“foreign
**passthru payments”) to persons that fail to meet certain certification, reporting, or related requirements. A**
number of jurisdictions (including Spain) have entered into, or have agreed in substance to, intergovernmental

A44408936

## 146


-----

agreements with the U.S. to implement FATCA (“IGAs”), which modify the way in which FATCA applies in
their jurisdictions. Certain aspects of the application of the FATCA provisions and IGAs to instruments such as
the Notes, including whether withholding would ever be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect
to payments on instruments such as the Notes, are uncertain and may be subject to change. Even if withholding
would be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as the Notes,
such withholding would not apply prior to the date that is two years after the publication of the final regulations
defining “foreign passthru payment” and Notes characterised as debt (or which are not otherwise characterised
as equity and have a fixed term) for U.S. federal tax purposes that are issued on or prior to the date that is six
months after the date on which final regulations defining “foreign passthru payments” are filed with the U.S.
Federal Register generally would be “grandfathered” for purposes of FATCA withholding unless materially
modified after such date. Noteholders should consult their own tax advisers regarding how these rules may
apply to their investment in the Notes. In the event any withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or
an IGA with respect to payments on the Notes, no person will be required to pay additional amounts as a result
of the withholding.

### SUBSCRIPTION AND SALE

Notes may be sold from time to time by the Issuer to any one or more of Banco de Sabadell, S.A., Banco
Santander, S.A., BNP Paribas, CaixaBank, S.A., Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A., Mediobanca – Banca di Credito
Finanziario S.p.A. and UniCredit Bank AG (the “Dealers”). The arrangements under which Notes may from
time to time be agreed to be sold by the Issuer to, and subscribed by, Dealers are set out in an amended and
restated dealer agreement dated 3 August 2021 (the “Dealer Agreement”) and made between the Issuer, the
Guarantor and the Dealers. If in the case of any Tranche of Notes the method of distribution is an agreement
between the Issuer and a single Dealer for that Tranche to be issued by the Issuer and subscribed by that Dealer,
the method of distribution will be described in the relevant Final Terms as “Non-Syndicated” and the name of
that Dealer and any other interest of that Dealer which is material to the issue of that Tranche beyond the fact
of the appointment of that Dealer will be set out in the relevant Final Terms. If in the case of any Tranche of
Notes the method of distribution is an agreement between the Issuer and more than one Dealer for that Tranche
to be issued by the Issuer and subscribed by those Dealers, the method of distribution will be described in the
relevant Final Terms as “Syndicated”, the obligations of those Dealers to subscribe the relevant Notes will be
joint and several and the names and addresses of those Dealers and any other interests of any of those Dealers
which are material to the issue of that Tranche beyond the fact of the appointment of those Dealers (including
whether any of those Dealers has also been appointed to act as Stabilising Manager in relation to that Tranche)
will be set out in the relevant Final Terms.

Any such agreement will, inter alia, make provision for the form and terms and conditions of the relevant Notes,
the price at which such Notes will be subscribed by the Dealer(s) and the commissions or other agreed
deductibles (if any) payable or allowable by the Issuer in respect of such subscription. The Dealer Agreement
makes provision for the resignation or termination of appointment of existing Dealers and for the appointment
of additional or other Dealers either generally in respect of the Programme or in relation to a particular Tranche
of Notes.

### U.S.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold
within the U.S. or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except in certain transactions exempt from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to
them by Regulation S.

Notes in bearer form are subject to U.S. tax law requirements and may not be offered, sold or delivered within
the U.S. or its possessions or to a U.S. person, except in certain transactions permitted by U.S. tax regulations.
Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended and regulations promulgated thereunder.

Each Dealer has agreed, and each further Dealer appointed under the Programme will be required to agree, that,
except as permitted by the Dealer Agreement, it will not offer, sell or (in the case of Notes in bearer form)
deliver Notes, (i) as part of their distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the completion of
the distribution of the Notes comprising the relevant Tranche, as determined and certified to the Fiscal Agent
by such Dealer (or, in the case of a sale of a Tranche of Notes to or through more than one Dealer, by each of
such Dealers as to the Notes of such Tranche purchased by or through it, in which case the Fiscal Agent shall
notify each such Dealer when all such Dealers have so certified) within the U.S. or to, or for the account or
benefit of, U.S. persons, and such Dealer will have sent to each dealer to which it sells Notes during the
distribution compliance period relating thereto a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on
offers and sales of the Notes within the U.S. or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons.

A44408936

## 148


-----

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering of Notes comprising any Tranche, any offer
or sale of Notes within the U.S. by any dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the
registration requirements of the Securities Act.

### Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors

(b) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of

### Kingdom of Spain

Each of the Dealers, the Issuer and the Guarantor have represented and agreed, and each further Dealer
appointed under the Programme will be required to represent and agree, that the Notes will not be offered, sold
or distributed, nor will any subsequent resale of Notes be carried out in Spain, except in circumstances which
do not require the publication of a prospectus in Spain, or without complying with all legal and regulatory
requirements under Spanish securities laws. Neither the Notes nor the Base Prospectus have been registered
with the CNMV and therefore the Base Prospectus is not intended for any public offer of the Notes in Spain
that would require the registration of a prospectus with the CNMV.

### Republic of Italy 

The offering of the Notes has not been registered with the Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa
(“CONSOB”) pursuant to Italian securities legislation and, accordingly, no Notes may be offered, sold or
delivered, nor may copies of the Base Prospectus or of any other document relating to any Notes be distributed
in the Republic of Italy, except, in accordance with all Italian securities, tax and exchange control and other
applicable laws and regulations.

Each of the Dealers has represented and agreed, and each further Dealer appointed under the Programme will
be required to represent and agree, that it will not offer, sell or deliver any Note or distribute any copies of this
Base Prospectus and/or any other document relating to the Notes in the Republic of Italy except:

(i) to qualified investors _(investitori qualificati), as defined pursuant to Article 2 of the Prospectus_
Regulation and any applicable provision of the Italian laws and regulations; or

(ii) in other circumstances which are exempted from the rules on public offerings pursuant to Article 1 of
the Prospectus Regulation, Article 100 of the Legislative Decree No. 58 of 24 February 1998 (the
“Financial Services Act”) and Article 34-ter of the Issuers Regulation, as amended from time to time,
and applicable Italian laws.

In any event, any offer, sale or delivery of the Notes or distribution of copies of this Base Prospectus or any
other document relating to the Notes in the Republic of Italy under paragraphs (i) or (ii) above must be:

implementing guidelines of the Bank of Italy, as amended from time to time; and

(c) in compliance with any other applicable laws and regulations, including any limitation or
requirement imposed by CONSOB or the Bank of Italy or other competent Authority.

### Provisions relating to the secondary market

_Please note that in accordance with Article 5 of the Prospectus Regulation and Article 100-bis of the Financial_
_Services Act, where no exemption from the rules on public offerings applies, the subsequent distribution of the_
_Notes on the secondary market in Italy must be made in compliance with the public offer and the prospectus_
_requirement rules provided under the Prospectus Regulation, the Financial Services Act and the Issuers_
_Regulation. Failure to comply with such rules may result in the sale of such Notes being declared null and void_
_and in the liability of the intermediary transferring the financial instruments for any damages suffered by the_
_investors. Furthermore, a public offer occurs also where the Notes which are initially offered and placed in_
_Italy or abroad to qualified investors only but in the following 12 months are “systematically” distributed on_
_the secondary market in Italy. Where no exemption from the rules on public offerings applies, failure to comply_
_with the prospectus requirement rules provided under the Prospectus Regulation, the Financial Services Act_
_and Issuers Regulation may result in the purchasers of Notes who are acting outside of the course of their_
_business or profession being entitled to declare such purchase void and to claim damages from any authorised_
_person at whose premises the Notes were purchased (soggetti abilitati presso cui è avvenuta la vendita)._

### France

Each Dealer has represented and agreed and any further Dealer appointed under the Programme will be required
to represent and agree, that it has only offered or sold, and will only offer or sell directly or indirectly Notes in
France to, and has only distributed or caused to be distributed and will only distribute or cause to be distributed
in France any offering material relating to the Notes to (i) qualified investors as defined in Article 2(e) of the
Prospectus Regulation.

This Base Prospectus has not been submitted for clearance to the Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

### Japan

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law of Japan
(Law No. 25 of 1948, as amended) and, accordingly, each Dealer has undertaken that it will not offer or sell
any Notes directly or indirectly, in Japan or to, or for the benefit of, any Japanese Person or to others for reoffering or resale, directly or indirectly, in Japan or to any Japanese Person except under circumstances which
will result in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and guidelines promulgated by the relevant
Japanese governmental and regulatory authorities and in effect at the relevant time. For the purposes of this
paragraph, “Japanese Person” shall mean any person resident in Japan, including any corporation or other
entity organised under the laws of Japan.

### General

Each Dealer has represented, warranted and agreed and each further Dealer appointed under the Programme
will be required to represent, warrant and agree with the Issuer and the Guarantor that it has, to the best of its
knowledge, complied and will comply with all applicable laws and regulations in each country or jurisdiction
in or from which it purchases, offers, sells or delivers Notes or possesses, distributes or publishes this Base
Prospectus or any Final Terms or any related offering material, in all cases at its own expense. Other persons
into whose hands this Base Prospectus or any Final Terms comes are required by the Issuer, the Guarantor and

A44408936

## 151


-----

the Dealers to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in each country or jurisdiction in or from which
they purchase, offer, sell or deliver Notes or possess, distribute or publish this Base Prospectus or any Final
Terms or any related offering material, in all cases at their own expense.

The Dealer Agreement provides that the Dealers shall not be bound by any of the restrictions relating to any
specific jurisdiction (set out above) to the extent that such restrictions shall, as a result of change(s) or change(s)
in official interpretation, after the date hereof, of applicable laws and regulations, no longer be applicable but
without prejudice to the obligations of the Dealers described in the paragraph headed “General” above.

Selling restrictions may be supplemented or modified with the agreement of the Issuer and the Guarantor. Any
such supplement or modification may be set out in a supplement to this Base Prospectus.

No representation is made that any action has been taken in any jurisdiction that would permit a public offering
of any of the Notes, or possession or distribution of the Base Prospectus or any other offering material or any
Final Terms, in any country or jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required.

### GENERAL INFORMATION

 Authorisation

1. The update of the Programme has been duly authorised by a resolution of the Board of Directors of Cellnex
on 6 May 2021 and by a resolution of the Sole Director of the Issuer on 6 May 2021, and the granting of
the Guarantee by Cellnex has been duly authorised by the aforementioned resolution of the Board of
Directors of Cellnex on 6 May 2021. Each of the Issuer and the Guarantor have obtained or will obtain
from time to time all necessary consents, approvals and authorisations in connection with the issue and
performance of the Notes.

2. The Base Prospectus has been approved by the Central Bank of Ireland (the “Central Bank”), as Irish
competent authority under the Prospectus Regulation. The Central Bank only approves this Base
Prospectus as meeting the requirements of completeness, comprehensibility and consistency imposed by
the Prospectus Regulation. Such an approval should not be considered as an endorsement of either the
Issuer or the Guarantor that are the subject of this Base Prospectus nor as an endorsement of the quality
of any Notes that are the subject of the Base Prospectus. Investors should make their own assessment as
to the suitability of investing in such Notes. Such approval relates only to the Notes which are to be
admitted to trading on a regulated market for the purposes of MiFID II and/or which are to be offered to
the public in any member state of the EEA. Application has been made to Euronext Dublin for the Notes
issued under the Programme during the period of 12 months from the date of this Base Prospectus to be
admitted to the official list and trading on its regulated market.

However, Notes issued under the Programme may be listed on a stock exchange different from Euronext
Dublin as the Issuer, the Guarantor and the Relevant Dealer(s) may agree.

### Legal and Arbitration Proceedings

3. Save as disclosed in “Description of the Guarantor – Legal Proceedings” above, there are no
governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings, (including any such proceedings which are pending or
threatened, of which the Issuer and Cellnex are aware), which may have, or have had during the 12 months
prior to the date of this Base Prospectus, a significant effect on the financial position or profitability of the
Issuer or of Cellnex or of the Group.

### Trend Information 

4. Since 31 December 2020 there has been no material adverse change in the prospects of the Issuer or of

being issued.

### Dealers transacting with the Issuer and the Guarantor

12. Certain of the Dealers and their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in financing,
investment banking and/or commercial banking transactions with, and may perform services for, the
Issuer, the Guarantor and their affiliates in the ordinary course of business. In addition, in the ordinary
course of their business activities, the Dealers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of
investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial
instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such
investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer, the Guarantor
or their affiliates. Certain of the Dealers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Issuer
or the Guarantor routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer or the Guarantor consistent with their
customary risk management policies. Typically, such Dealers and their affiliates would hedge such
exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the
creation of short positions in securities, including potentially the Notes issued under the Programme. Any
such positions could adversely affect future trading prices of Notes issued under the Programme. The
Dealers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express
independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or
recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. For
the purposes of this paragraph the term “affiliates” includes also parent companies.

### Clearing of the Notes

13. The Notes have been accepted for clearance through Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. The
appropriate common code and/or the International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) in relation to
the Notes of each Tranche will be specified in the relevant Final Terms. The relevant Final Terms shall
specify any other clearing system as shall have accepted the relevant Notes for clearance together with
any further appropriate information.

### Issue Price and Yield

14. Notes may be issued at any price. The issue price of each Tranche of Notes to be issued under the
Programme will be determined by the Issuer, the Guarantor and the relevant Dealer(s) at the time of issue
in accordance with prevailing market conditions and the issue price of the relevant Notes or the method
of determining the price and the process for its disclosure will be set out in the applicable Final Terms. In
the case of different Tranches of a Series of Notes, the issue price may include accrued interest in respect
of the period from and including the interest commencement date of the relevant Tranche (which may be

## 155


-----

the issue date of the first Tranche of the Series or, if interest payment dates have already passed, the most
recent interest payment date in respect of the Series) to but excluding the issue date of the relevant Tranche.

The yield of each Tranche of Notes set out in the applicable Final Terms will be calculated as of the
relevant issue date on an annual or semi-annual basis using the relevant issue price. It is not an indication
of future yield.

### Bank of New York Mellon

15. The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, Dublin Branch is acting solely in its capacity as listing agent for
the Issuer and the Guarantor (and not on its own behalf) in connection with the application for admission
of Notes to the Official List of Euronext Dublin and trading on its regulated market.

### Validity of Base Prospectus and prospectus supplements
