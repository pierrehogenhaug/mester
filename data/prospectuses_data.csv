235,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,,1.1.1,,"_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk and is suitable only for investors who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom. Investors should consider carefully whether an investment in the Notes is suitable for them in the light of the risks described below and other information in this offering memorandum and their personal circumstances. The occurrence of any of the following events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition and impair our ability to fulfil our obligations in respect of the Notes, potentially causing a loss of all or part of the investment made when purchasing the Notes. The risk factors described below are not an exhaustive list or explanation of all relevant risks and should be used as guidance only. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may individually or cumulatively also have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. This offering memorandum contains “forward-looking” statements that are based on assumptions and estimates, and subject to risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this offering memorandum. See “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”_",,,,N/A
