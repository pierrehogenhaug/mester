16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.1,The Group faces significant competition in each of the industries in which the Group operates and competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business.,"The French telecommunications market is a mature market, marked by very active competition between the main operators and very strong pressure on prices. Despite growth in market size, the French telecommunications market has recently declined in value primarily due to price pressure in the mobile market following the arrival of a fourth player in 2012 and the decline in regulated call termination rates. The Group faces significant competition from established and more recent competitors and may face competition from new entrants and market concentrations in the future. While the nature and level of competition to which the Group is subject vary according to the products and services that it offers, in each case the Group generally competes on the basis of prices, marketing, products, network coverage, characteristics of services, and customer service. The main competitor of the Group in the residential and business services markets overall is Orange, the incumbent telecommunications operator in France, that has greater financial resources and owns a more extensive network than the Group’s and that is unlikely to be duplicated or matched by the Group in the near future. Bouygues Telecom Enterprises (“Bouygues Telecom”) and Iliad are the Group’s major competitors in the residential market. In the premium pay-TV market, Groupe Canal+ products are available throughout the French territory via satellite, cable, and DTT and DSL technologies. The Group’s main competitor in business services markets overall is Orange, the incumbent telecommunications operator in France. Orange has greater financial resources and owns a more extensive network than the Group which the Group is unlikely to duplicate or match in the near future. In the residential market, in addition to Orange and Bouygues Telecom, the Group also competes with international telecommunications operators such as Colt, Verizon, AT&T, and BT, which offer multinationals access to their international networks while the Group’s network is available only in France. The Group also has operations in the French Overseas Territories that face competition and competitive pressure risks similar to those described herein. The Group’s products and services are also subject to increasing competition from alternative new technologies or improvements in existing technologies. New players from sectors that are either unregulated or subject to different regulations (including internet players such as Yahoo!, Google, Disney+, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, YouTube, Netflix and other audiovisual players, media players and “over the top” (“OTT”) (of an existing broadband internet network) players) have also emerged as competitors to the Group’s video content offering. These players are taking advantage of improved connectivity and platform agnostic technologies to offer OTT and cloud-based services. Telecommunications operators are expected to maintain traditional access services and billing relationships over which users access services from adjacent players such as well-known companies offering music, video, photos, apps and retail. The rapid success of audiovisual content streamed through the telecommunications network and insufficient innovation could lead to the emergence of other content or service providers as well as the saturation of the market, which would put pressure on the revenues and margins of operators like the Group, while simultaneously requiring them to increase capital expenditures to remain competitive, which could adversely affect the Group’s business, financial condition or results of operations. ----- Moreover, the Group is also facing competition from non-traditional mobile voice and data services based on new mobile internet technologies, in particular OTT applications, such as Skype, Google Talk, Facetime, Viber and WhatsApp. These OTT applications are often free of charge, accessible via smartphones and allow their users to have access to potentially unlimited messaging and voice services over the internet, thus bypassing more expensive traditional voice and messaging services, such as SMS and MMS, provided by mobile network operators, who are only able to charge the internet data usage for such services. All telecommunications operators are currently competing with OTT service providers who leverage existing infrastructures and operate capitallight business models, enhancing their ability to compete with businesses, such as the Group’s, which operate capital-intensive business models. OTT service providers have over the past years become more sophisticated and technological developments have led to a significant improvement in the quality of service, particularly in speech quality. In addition, players with strong brand capability and financial strength, such as Apple, Google and Microsoft, have turned their attention to the provision of OTT audio and data services. In the long term, if nontraditional mobile voice and data services or similar services continue to increase in popularity and if the Group, or more generally all of the telecommunications operators, are not able to address this competition, this could cause declines in subscriber base and profitability across all of the Group’s products and services, among other material adverse effects. In addition, the Group may face increasing competition from the large-scale roll-out of public Wifi networks by local governments and utilities and transportation service providers, new and existing Wifi telecommunications operators and others, which particularly benefits OTT service providers. Due to their ability to leverage existing infrastructure and to roll out public Wifi in a cost-efficient way, the Group’s competitors may be better positioned to offer their customers public Wifi access at attractive terms and conditions or as part of their current mobile and landline offerings, which may affect the Group’s ability to retain or acquire customers. Furthermore, the Group’s competitors may realize cost savings by off-loading mobile data traffic onto their own Wifi networks or those of their partners in order to reduce costs and increase bandwidth more quickly or efficiently than the Group can. An increase in public Wifi networks could also cause declines in profitability as demand for the Group’s network and services decreases. The following is an overview of the competitive landscape in France: _1. Residential—Mobile_ The Group competes with service providers that use alternative technologies for internet access, such as satellite technologies or mobile standards such as universal mobile telecommunications system (“UMTS”) and 3G/4G mobile technologies. These mobile broadband high speed internet access technologies may enable both incumbent and new broadband access providers to provide high bandwidth connection services for voice and data. Furthermore, additional access technologies may be launched in the future that will further increase competition or lead the Group to increase capital expenditure for additional upgrades. Providers of mobile broadband internet access may be able to offer fast internet access speeds at a competitive cost, with the additional possibility of allowing subscribers to access the internet remotely. The French mobile telephony market is characterized by competition among well-established mobile network operators such as Orange, Bouygues Telecom and Free and other operators without their own mobile networks. Competition has intensified, particularly as to price, since Free entered the market in early 2012 with a low-priced unlimited calling package. The mobile telephony market in France is currently undergoing a transformation because of competitive pricing, bundled packages no longer including subsidized handsets and the development of “low cost” brands. After strong price decreases in 2013 and 2014, which resulted in mobile post-paid prices in France being among the lowest in Europe, price pressure eased in 2015 and 2016 but intensified again in 2017, weakened slightly in 2018, increased again in 2019, and remained stable in 2020. If price pressure continues to intensify, the Group’s results of operations and financial condition in future periods may be materially adversely affected. _2. Residential—Fixed_ In the French pay-TV market, the Group competes with providers of premium television packages such as CanalSat, DSL triple-play and/or quadruple-play operators such as Orange, Free and Bouygues Telecom, which provide IPTV, and providers of pay DTT (such as Canal+, which operates across multiple formats: including IPTV, pay DTT, satellite and cable). The growth of IPTV, which is the most popular pay-TV distribution platform followed by satellite and DTT, has changed the market, opening up the provision of pay-TV services beyond the ----- traditional methods of cable and satellite, which is limited by the inability to install a satellite dish on the façade of buildings in certain areas, such as central Paris. The Group also competes with satellite television services that may be able to offer a greater range of channels to a larger audience, reaching wider geographic areas (especially in rural areas) for lower prices than the prices of the Group’s cable pay-TV services. Any increase in market share of satellite distribution may have a negative impact on the success of the Group’s digital cable television services. The Group also faces competition from satellite distribution of free to air television programming. While pay DTT’s share of the pay-TV market is currently low, providers of pay DTT may in the future be able to offer a wider range of channels to a larger audience for lower prices than the Group charges. In the broadband market, the Group provides high speed internet through its cable, FTTH and xDSL networks and it competes primarily with xDSL and FTTH providers, with FTTH currently being the most widespread technology used to access very high speed internet in France. Orange is the leading DSL provider in France, followed by Free, the Group and Bouygues Telecom. While the Group believes that it has the network advantage in terms of its fiber optic/cable network compared to its competitors’ xDSL networks, and better coverage of fiber networks as compared to its competitors, which currently places the Group at a competitive advantage to exploit the increased demand in France for very-high-speed internet in the areas covered by the Group’s fiber optic/cable network, such competitive advantage may be diminished to the extent that competitors increase the roll out their FTTH networks. For further information see “The deployment of fiber optic networks and/or VDSL2 by _competitors of the Group could reduce and ultimately eliminate the gap between the speed and the power of the fiber optic/cable network of the Group compared to the DSL networks of its main competitors.” In addition, the_ Group’s xDSL competitors’ networks cover more French households than the Group’s network and pricing is very competitive. _3. Business Services—B2B_ In the B2B segment the Group’s main competitors are Orange (Orange Business Services) and Colt. Bouygues Telecom is also a competitor in the SME segment. The French B2B market for voice services is extremely price sensitive, with sophisticated customers, relatively short term (typically one year) contracts, and vulnerability to cuts in mobile termination rates. The ability to compete effectively is partially a function of network capillarity, and certain of the Group’s competitors have a more extensive and denser network than us. In the data market, customers also often seek combined infrastructure and software solutions. As a result, the Group also competes with software and other IT providers of data and network solutions, which may decrease the value customers place on its infrastructure solutions, leading to a reduction in its prices and margins. IT providers may also partner with the Group’s infrastructure telecommunications competitors. _4. Business Services—Wholesale_ The French wholesale telecommunications market is dominated by Orange and the Group, although Orange’s and the Group’s market shares vary depending on the segment. The Group also faces competition from consortiums of telecommunications operators and construction companies, such as Covage, Vinci, Eiffage and Axiom (who may lay down fiber in construction sites and then lease them on the wholesale market). The wholesale market for data services in France is less volatile than the voice market. Competition is based primarily, in addition to price, on service quality and technological advancement. The wholesale market for dark fiber infrastructure in France is more open than for wholesale voice and data carriage, as providing it does not require having a dense, national network and does not include any services would require technical expertise. The Group expects competition in the French telecommunications industry to remain intense and there can be no assurance that the Group will not be negatively impacted by any future consolidation of the Group’s competitors or similar developments in one or more of the markets in which the Group competes. For further details regarding the competitive environment, in which we operate, see “Industry, Competition and Market Overview”.",,,,N/A
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.2,The deployment of fiber optic networks and/or VDSL2 by competitors of the Group could reduce and ultimately eliminate the gap between the speed and the power of the fiber optic/cable network of the Group compared to the DSL networks of its main competitors.,"The Group believes that one of its major competitive advantages is the power and speed of its fiber optic/cable network. As of June 30, 2020, the Group’s network passed approximately 17,457,000 fiber/cable homes, including fiber/cable homes now passed by SFR FTTH. However, competitors of the Group are also deploying fiber and/or VDSL2 networks enabling download speeds and bandwidths that could rival those reached by the Group’s network, and thus strongly reduce the Group’s competitive advantage. The Group’s main competitors (Orange, ----- Free and Bouygues Telecom) have begun to introduce FTTH networks to increase and harmonize their network speed. On December 4, 2019, Orange unveiled its strategic plan through 2025 indicating its objectives for FTTH lines to include the deployment of approximately 19 million lines in private areas (compared to 10.4 million already rolled-out as of June 2019) and approximately 4 million lines in investment areas (compared to 0.4 million as of June 2019) in addition of approximately 13 million lines deployed by a third party and co-financed by Orange by 2023 (Source: _Orange press release). Furthermore, other operators may obtain access to the infrastructure deployed by an operator, through joint projects for financing. All of the DSL operators have announced various agreements on sharing the deployment of FTTH in given areas. For example, Orange and Free entered into a contract in July 2013 providing for the deployment by Free of a fiber network using Orange’s infrastructure in approximately 20 French cities, which allows for open access to all competing operators. In addition, in 2013 the French government announced a FTTH deployment plan of €20 billion (invested by private operators and local authorities) with the objective of providing very-high-speed internet access to the entire territory in 2022. The government will provide a subsidy package of approximately €3,300 million, partly from funding from the Investments for the Future Program managed by the Office of the General Commissioner of Investment under the 2015 Budget Act. The rollout has been divided in three zones: very dense areas (approximately six million households) and low-density areas (approximately 13 million households), that are already covered or will be covered by FTTH with privately-funded networks; and low-density areas (approximately 15 million households), where private operators will co-invest with public partners. Orange and the Group will lead the deployment of the very-high speed network in privately-funded, low density areas, with the Group being in charge of approximately 20% of the network deployment. Various local and regional authorities have already extended subsidies to network operators, including the Group, to install FTTH connections. This trend should continue, as certain departments, municipalities and regions, such as Hauts-deSeine, Amiens and Louvin, for example, have entered into public-private partnerships to encourage such investments. In such areas, various operators will have access to the network and will be able to compete. In addition, in accordance with the conditions established by ARCEP, third-party operators may have access to the infrastructure used by an operator, including by co-financing projects, for their own very-high-speed internet offers. As a result, FTTH deployment by the Group’s competitors could accelerate and the share of FTTH on the highspeed internet market could grow significantly, thereby eliminating or reducing the Group’s fixed network advantage. VDSL2 technology has also been implemented in some areas by competitors of the Group. Deployment of VDSL2 only requires adding VDSL2 cards in already deployed digital subscriber line access multiplexers (“DSLAMs”) and does not involve physical intervention at the subscriber’s premises. Moreover, the deployment of this technology has accelerated since October 2014 given the favorable opinion of the copper experts committee that has allowed the marketing, starting from that date, of VDSL2 in indirect distribution on all lines from a main distribution frame (“MDF”) on Orange’s local copper loop. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 5,950,000 households were eligible for VDSL2 (source: ARCEP). If the competitors of the Group continue to deploy or significantly increase their fiber optic networks they could be able to compete with the Group in terms of the offering of high-speed internet and television services of a quality and speed greater than or equal to those of the Group, thus potentially eliminating the Group’s current competitive advantage, increasing the pressure upon prices and margins and leading the Group to make significant investments in order to match the services they offer. Deployment of VDSL2 and/or fiber optic networks by competitors also represents a risk for the business services activity of the Group, particularly with regard to medium-sized, small-to-medium-sized and very-small-sized businesses to which the Group’s DSL and fiber/cable networks network presently represent an advantage. Although the Group is preparing for this deployment by improving its product range and building out its fiber/cable network, such deployment could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position and results of operations.",,,,N/A
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.3,"Changes in competitive offerings for content, including the potential rapid adoption of piracy-based video offerings, could adversely impact the Group’s business.","The market for content is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video, sports and other content. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the content market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage the Group’s business, as its fundamental proposition of virtually all content being offered for ----- free to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against. Furthermore, in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of content, including broadcasters, as well as internet based e-commerce or content providers are increasing their internetbased offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market, or existing providers may adjust their services, with unique offerings or approaches to providing content. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If the Group is unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors, the Group’s business will be adversely affected, and it may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.",,,,N/A
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.4,"Acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks, including the risk that the Group may not be able to integrate newly acquired operations into its business, which may prevent the Group from realizing the strategic and financial goals contemplated at the time of any such transaction and thus adversely affect the its business.","Historically, the Group’s business has grown, in part, through a significant number of selective acquisitions, including the SFR Acquisition that has enabled the Group to take advantage of existing networks, service offerings and management expertise. The Group may continue to grow its business through acquisitions of broadband and mobile communications businesses, content companies and ancillary services that we believe will present opportunities to create value by generating strong cash flows and operational synergies. In addition, we have recently entered into certain strategic transactions, such as the Towers Transactions and the sale of the Group’s Voice Carrier Business, to monetize the value of certain of our non-core assets in France, and the sale of a 49.99% interest in SFR FTTH to create an alternative FTTH infrastructure wholesale operator. Moreover, SFR FTTH (an associate of the Group) has entered into agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in Covage, which transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2020. In the future, the Group may enter into similar transactions. Any acquisition, disposal or other strategic transaction the Group may undertake in the future could result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest expenses, amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets or in the use by us of available cash on hand to finance any such acquisitions. The Group may experience difficulties in integrating acquired operations into the Group’s business, incur higher than expected costs or fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits or synergies of these acquisitions, if any. Such transactions may also disrupt the Group’s relationships with current and new employees, customers and suppliers. In addition, the Group’s management may be distracted by such acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses. Thus, if the Group consummates any further acquisitions or fail to integrate any previous acquisitions, there could be a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing business acquisitions or integrating previously acquired companies. In addition, the Group’s debt burden may increase if we borrow funds to finance any future transactions, which could have a negative impact on the Group’s cash flows and the Group’s ability to finance our overall operations. Acquisitions or disposals of additional telecommunications companies may require the approval of governmental authorities (either domestically or, in the case of the EU, at the EU level), which can block, impose conditions on, or delay the process which could result in a failure on our part to proceed with announced transactions on a timely basis or at all, thus hampering our opportunities for growth. In the event conditions are imposed and we fail to meet them in a timely manner, the relevant governmental authority may impose fines and, if in connection with a merger transaction, may require restorative measures, such as mandatory disposition of assets or divestiture of operations. Although we analyze and conduct due diligence on acquisition targets, our assessments are subject to a number of assumptions concerning profitability, growth, interest rates and company valuations and our inquiries may fail to uncover relevant information. There can be no assurance that our assessments or due diligence of and assumptions regarding acquisition targets will prove to be correct, and actual developments may differ significantly from our expectations. Moreover, our plans to acquire additional businesses in the future are subject to the availability of suitable opportunities. The Group’s competitors may also follow similar acquisition strategies and may have greater financial resources available for investments or may be willing to accept less favorable terms than we can accept, which may prevent us from acquiring businesses that we target to the benefit of our competitors. ----- The operating complexity of the Group’s business and the responsibilities of management have increased significantly as a result of the growth of our business through acquisitions, which may place significant strain on our managerial and operational resources. The Group may be unable to allocate sufficient managerial and operational resources to meet our needs as our business grows, and our current operational and financial systems and managerial controls and procedures may become inadequate. Although the Group considers the operational and financial systems and managerial controls and procedures that we currently have in place to be adequate for the Group’s purposes, we recognize that the effectiveness of these systems, controls and procedures needs to be kept under regular review as the Group’s business grows. The Group will have to maintain close coordination among our logistical, technical, accounting, finance, marketing and sales personnel. Management of growth will also require, among other things, continued development of financial and management controls and information technology systems. The constant growth may strain our managerial resources which may require the Group to hire additional managerial resources. The Group may be unable to hire managers with the relevant expertise or the hiring process may require significant time and resources, all of which could result in a disruption in the Group’s management, growth, operational and financial systems, managerial controls and procedures and, accordingly, the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Group periodically evaluates, and has engaged in, the disposition of certain non-core assets and businesses. Divestitures could involve difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management’s attention, the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees. After reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business, the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions as well as to obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction. Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested assets and businesses, such as indemnities or other financial obligations, in which the performance of the divested assets or businesses could impact our results of operations. Any divestiture the Group undertakes could adversely affect the Group’s financial condition and results of operations. In certain cases, the Group has entered into or may enter into joint venture arrangements with a majority or minority interest in such joint ventures. Even in cases where the Group has retained a majority interest, the joint venture partner may have significant influence over policies, including consent rights with respect to certain specified matters. The Group has a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint ventures and businesses in which it has made minority investments.",,,,N/A
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.5,The Group might not be able to effectively implement or adapt its business strategy.,"The Group has based its strategy on its vision of the market, especially the importance of very-high-speed fiber/cable and mobile networks and of fixed-mobile convergence. At the core of the Group’s strategy has been revenue, profitability and cash flow growth. Key elements of this strategy have included: (i) operational and financial turnaround under the leadership of a new management team; (ii) optimizing commercial performance with a particular focus on customer services; (iii) continuing to invest in best-in-class infrastructure commensurate with its market position; and (iv) monetizing content investments through various pay-TV models and growing advertising revenue. However, the Group is evolving in a market affected by economic, competitive and regulatory uncertainty and the Group must regularly adapt its business model to take into account market changes such as changes in consumer behavior, introduction of new technology, products or services, competition and the development of specific pricing policies, the adaptation of its structural costs, the streamlining of its operational organization, and the adaptation of its sales strategy. If the measures taken by the Group do not meet the demands, expectations, or habits of the consumer, it will have an adverse effect on the return on investments, financial targets, market share, and revenues generated. Consequently, any development of the Group’s business strategy that proves not to be sufficiently adapted to the actual trends and demands, expectations, or habits of the consumer in the telecommunications market may not achieve its desired goals and/or have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position and results of operations. Moreover, the transformation of the Group following the execution of certain strategic transactions, including non-core asset disposals, strategic acquisitions and investments or entry into joint venture arrangements, could create operational difficulties and unforeseen expenses and could give rise to significant administrative, financial, and managerial challenges involving the activity of the Group. Such strategic transactions may also disrupt its ongoing business, cause management’s attention to be diverted and result in legal, regulatory, contractual, labor, or other difficulties that have not been foreseen or disclosed. -----",,,,N/A
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.6,"Revenue from certain of the Group’s services has been declining or not growing, and the Group may be unable to offset such trends.","The Group’s total revenues and revenues in the residential fixed, residential mobile, business services and media segments declined in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. While the Group’s total revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31 2018, there was a decrease in revenues in the residential-fixed and media segments. Similarly, while the Group’s total revenue increased for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2019, there was a decrease in revenues in the equipment sales and media segments. The Group’s Adjusted EBITDA remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 and for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to June 30, 2019, but increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. While the Group is focused on achieving an operational financial turnaround, there can be no assurance that this trend of declines in revenue will not continue in future periods. The Group expects its DSL business with Bouygues Telecom to continue to decline. In particular, churn in Bouygues Telecom’s DSL white label customers has already led to a decrease in white label subscribers. If the revenue and profitability loss from such businesses is not offset by revenue and profitability growth in other Group businesses, this could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business activities, the results of its operation and financial condition. In addition, the Group could experience further decreases in customers on its DSL network in the future due to their migration to fiber/cable networks providing them with access to greater internet speeds compared with those available on DSL networks. If the revenue and profitability loss from customers on the Group’s DSL network is not offset by revenue and profitability growth on the Group’s fiber/cable network, this could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business activities, the results of operation and financial condition.",,,,N/A
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.7,"Customer churn, or the threat of customer churn, may adversely affect the Group’s business.","The Group’s ability to attract and retain subscribers to its services or to increase profitability from existing subscribers will depend in large part on the Group’s ability to stimulate and increase subscriber usage, convince subscribers to switch from competitors’ services to our services and the Group’s ability to minimize customer churn. Customer churn is a measure of the number of customers who stop subscribing for one or more of our products or services. Churn arises mainly as a result of the contractual subscription period (generally 12 months in the residential segments and between one and three years in the business services market), competitive influences, the relocation of clients outside of the Group’s network area (which is less extensive than our competitors), introduction of new products and technologies, deterioration of personal financial circumstances, price increases and regulatory developments. Customer churn may also increase if the Group is unable to deliver satisfactory services over its network, or if it modifies the types of services it makes available in a certain region. In addition, customer churn also arises upon the cancellation of services to customers who are delinquent in their payments to the Group. In addition, the Group outsources many of its customer service functions to third party contractors over which the Group has less control than if it were performing those tasks itself. The Group has experienced significant churn in mobile and fixed customers in recent years due to intense competition. Moreover, the churn rate in the Group’s white label business may increase for reasons outside the Group’s control (as it is not involved in client services and retention). In particular, churn in Bouygues Telecom’s DSL white label customers has already led to a decrease in white label subscribers, which is expected to continue in the long term. See “Business of the Group—Material Contracts—White Label Agreements”. If the Group fails to effectively communicate the benefits of the Group’s networks through its marketing advertising efforts, it may not be able to attract new customers and our efforts to attract and retain customers may prove unsuccessful. In addition, any interruption of the Group’s services or the removal or unavailability of programming, which may not be under our control, could contribute to increased customer churn. Further the Group’s competitors may improve their ability to attract new customers, for example by offering new product bundles or product offerings at lower prices than the Group, which would make it difficult for the Group to retain its current subscribers, and the cost of retaining and acquiring new subscribers could increase. In addition, the Group’s business services operations are also subject to tariff churn (i.e. an existing customer negotiating tariff decreases). Large corporate customers in particular are highly sophisticated and often aggressive in seeking to renegotiate the pricing of their contracts, which tends to result in margin pressure. Increased customer or tariff churn may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. -----",,,,N/A

Should the Group fail to or be significantly delayed in introducing new products and services in the future, if the Group’s new products and services are not accepted by customers, or if the Group’s competitors introduce more sophisticated or more popular products and services, the Group’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected.",,,,N/A
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.10,"If the Group is unable to obtain attractive content on satisfactory terms for its services, the demand for these services could be reduced, thereby lowering revenue and profitability.","The success of the Group’s pay-TV services depends on access to an attractive selection of television programming. For example, the ability to provide movies, sports and other popular programming, including videoon-demand (“VOD”) content, is a major factor that attracts subscribers to pay-TV services, especially premium services. The Group relies on digital programming suppliers for a significant portion of the Group’s programming content and VOD services. The Group may not be able to obtain sufficient high quality programming, sports and other content from third party producers for the Group’s digital cable television and other services on satisfactory terms or at all in order to offer compelling digital cable television services. The Group also relies on certain of its competitors for the provision of certain content offerings. In addition, to the extent that the Group is unable to reach agreements with certain content providers on terms that the Group believes is reasonable, the Group may be forced, or may determine for strategic or business reasons, to remove such content from its line-up and may decide to replace it with other programming, which may not be available on acceptable terms or be as attractive to customers. There can be no assurance that the Group’s expiring programming and other content contracts will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms or at all, or that the rights the Group negotiates will be adequate for it to execute the Group’s business strategy. The inability to obtain high quality content, may also limit the Group’s ability to migrate customers from lower tier programming to higher tier products, thereby inhibiting the Group’s ability to execute its business strategy. Any or all of these factors could result in reduced demand for, and lower revenue and profitability from, the Group’s digital cable television and other content services. Programming and content-related costs are one of the Group’s largest categories of expenses. In recent years, the cost of programming in the cable and satellite video industries has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase, particularly with respect to costs for sports programming and broadcast networks. The Group may not be able to pass these increased programming costs on to the Group’s subscribers due to the increasingly competitive environment that the Group operates in. If the Group is unable to pass these increased programming costs on to its subscribers, its business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Moreover, programming costs typically include a minimum guaranteed amount and a variable amount related directly to the number of subscribers to whom the programming is provided, which may affect the Group’s ability to negotiate lower per-subscriber programming costs and which could impact the Group’s operating margins. The expiration dates of the Group’s various programming contracts are staggered, which results in the expiration of a portion of its programming contracts throughout each year. The Group may not be able to renegotiate these agreements on terms as favorable as those of the current agreements, or at all, which could result in a decline in the revenue generated or an increase in the Group’s costs deriving from broadcaster licences. The Group attempts to control its programming costs and, therefore, the cost of the video services it charges to its customers, by negotiating favorable terms for the renewal of its affiliation agreements with programmers. To the ----- extent the Group is unable to reach agreements with certain programmers on terms it believes are reasonable, the Group may be forced to, or determine for strategic reasons to, remove certain programming from its line-up and may decide to replace such programming with alternatives which may not be as attractive to consumers or available on acceptable terms. Such negotiations have in the past and may in the future affect the Group’s carriage of particular programming services. Some of the Group’s programming contracts require it to pay prices for the programming based on a guaranteed minimum number of subscribers, even if that number is larger than the number of actual subscribers, whereas some of the Group’s programming contracts are based on a flat fee irrespective of the popularity of the content purchased under such contract. As a result, if the Group misjudges anticipated demand for the programming or if the programming it acquires does not attract the number of viewers anticipated, the profitability of the Group’s television services may be impaired. Furthermore, as the Group purchases a significant portion of its content from various content providers under relatively short term contracts, the prices the Group pays to purchase such content is subject to change and may increase significantly in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s results of operations. Furthermore, program providers and broadcasters may elect to distribute their programming through other distribution platforms, such as satellite platforms, digital terrestrial broadcasting or IPTV, or may enter into exclusive arrangements with other distributors. Such actions may inconvenience some of the Group’s subscribers and can lead to customer dissatisfaction and, in certain cases, the loss of customers, which may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, as long as the Group continues to develop its VOD and other interactive services, its ability to acquire programs for its free VOD offerings (replay), VOD by subscription, and one-time VOD will become more and more crucial and will depend on the ability of the Group to maintain a relationship and cooperation with content providers and broadcasters, for both standard-definition as well as HD content. If the Group cannot obtain and keep competitive programs at attractive prices on its networks, demand for its services could decline, thus limiting its ability to maintain or increase the revenue. A loss of programs or an inability to ensure the availability of premium content under favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on the business activities of the Group, its financial position and its results of operations.",,,,N/A
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.11,The Group’s business is capital-intensive and its capital expenditures may not generate a positive return or the Group may be unable or unwilling to make additional capital expenditures.,"The Group’s business demands significant capital expenditures to add customers to our networks, including expenditures relating to equipment and labor. In particular, the Group incurs significant capital expenses for the deployment of new technologies such as 4G and 5G (for the purchase of frequencies and the deployment of network infrastructures) for its mobile operations and fiber optics (for the deployment of the fiber infrastructure) and for its fixed operations. Moreover, as spectrum auctions are infrequent and the Group may need additional spectrum in the future, the Group will likely participate in future spectrum auctions even though it might not, at the time of auction, require additional spectrum capacity. Such participation would require significant capital expenditures in the near term as acquiring spectrum is expensive, due in part to the fact that spectrum availability is limited. Furthermore, new technologies and the use of multiple applications increasing customers’ bandwidth requirements could lead to saturation of the networks and require telecommunications operators to make additional investments to increase the capacity of their infrastructures. Moreover, the Group regularly invests in the content that we offer in order to provide our subscribers with a flexible and diverse range of programming and other content options, including high-quality local content and exclusive premium content, in order to reduce churn. For example, the structure of the French telecommunications market does not allow telecommunications operators to pass along their investment costs to the end consumer in proportion to the volume of data consumed. Accordingly, telecommunications operators may not benefit from increased revenues from the growing demand for data and content even though they incur the costs of such demand through their investments in infrastructure. The Group is also bound by certain obligations of access and/or coverage for its fiber/cable and/or mobile network, particularly under its mobile licences, such as obligations to allow roaming or sharing of networks in certain deployment zones. This requires the Group to make significant and frequent investments and the conditions for ----- the implementation of these obligations, including some prices (such as roaming rates), may be regulated within the EU. Given such constraints, the Group may not be able to operate its network under economically favorable conditions, which could affect the profitability of its investments. The Group may be subject to similar obligations in the future, which could have a material effect on the manner in which the Group operates its business and, accordingly, on its outlook, financial position or results of operations. It cannot be guaranteed that the Group will continue to have sufficient resources to maintain the quality of its network and of its other products and services, and to expand the Group’s network coverage, which are key elements for its growth of over the long term. Unforeseen investment expenses, an inability to finance them at an acceptable cost or even an inability to make profitable investments could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, outlook, financial position or results of operations.",,,,N/A
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.12,The Group is subject to increasing operating costs and inflation risks which may adversely affect its earnings.,"While the Group generally attempts to increase our subscription rates to offset increases in operating costs, there is no assurance that it will be able to do so due to competitive and other factors. Therefore, operating costs may rise faster than associated revenue, resulting in a material negative impact on the Group’s cash flow and results of operations. The Group is also affected by inflationary increases in salaries, wages, benefits and other administrative costs which the Group may not be in a position to pass on to its customers, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.13,"The continuity of the Group’s services strongly depends on the proper functioning of its IT and network infrastructure and any failure of this infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on the business of the Group, its financial position and its results of operations.","The reliability and quality (both in terms of service as well as availability) of the Group’s information systems and networks, particularly for its mobile and fixed businesses, are key components of its business activities, the continuity of its services and the confidence of its customers. More specifically, the unavailability or failure of information systems used by the Group, the Group’s network, the production of “electronic” communications services and television, the Group’s website, and the customer service function of the Group, could significantly disrupt the Group’s business. A flood, fire, other natural disaster, war, act of terrorism, power failure, cyber-attack, computer virus or other catastrophe affecting a portion of the Group’s network could have a material adverse impact on its business and its relations with customers. For example, the Group’s business in the French Overseas Territories has experienced network disruptions and other adverse effects in the past, and may experience network disruption and other adverse effects in the future, as a result of extreme weather and other environmental conditions. Measures with the aim of remedying such disasters, safety and security measures, or measures for protecting service continuity that have been undertaken or may be undertaken in the future by the Group, as well as the effects thereof on the performance of its network, could be insufficient to avoid losses. The Group is insured against operating losses only up to a capped amount, any disaster or other damage affecting the network of the Group could result in significant uninsured losses. The Group’s network may be subjected to disruptions and to significant technological problems, and such difficulties could escalate over time. For example, although the Group’s cable networks are generally built in resilient rings to ensure the continuity of network availability in the event of any damage to its underground fibers, if any ring is cut twice in different locations, transmission signals will not be able to pass through, which could cause significant damage to the Group’s business. In the event of a power outage or other shortage, we do not have a back up or alternative supply source for all of the Group’s network components. The occurrence of any such event could cause interruptions in service or reduce capacity for customers, either of which could reduce the Group’s revenue or cause the Group to incur additional expenses. In addition, the occurrence of any such event may subject us to penalties and other sanctions imposed by regulators. Further, the Group may incur costs and revenue losses associated with the unauthorized use of the Group’s networks, including administrative and capital costs associated with the unpaid use of the Group’s networks as well as with detecting, monitoring and reducing the incidences of fraud. Fraud also impacts interconnection costs, capacity costs, administrative costs and payments to other carriers for unbillable fraudulent roaming charges. In addition, the Group’s business depends on certain crucial systems, particularly its network operations center and its billing and customer service systems. In particular, the support for a large number of systems critical to the network of the Group is located at a relatively limited number of sites. While the Group has extensive backup systems, the risk that these systems may not be sufficient to handle a spike in activity cannot be ruled out, which could lead to a slowdown or unavailability of IT systems for a period of time and, when involving the business ----- services customers of the Group, to financial penalties. Moreover, the Group may incur legal penalties and reputational damages to the extent that any accident or security breach results in a loss of or damage to customers’ data or applications or the inappropriate disclosure of confidential information. Moreover, the technical projects of the Group that are in progress, involving both information systems and networks, and the plans for migrations planned in the short and medium terms for certain pieces of mobile network equipment, may generate an increased risk of failures of networks and information systems. In particular, the quality of the networks could be impacted by the deployment of the 4G network as well as by the concurrent work of renovating 2G and 3G networks, requiring, among other things, frequent technical interventions. Such work could also result in breakdowns or interruptions in services for the customers of the Group. Furthermore, the development of the resources used by consumers (for example, videoconferencing, telepresence, and cloud computing for business services customers), of the “Internet of Things”, and of new terminals (smartphones, tablets, etc.) may generate risks of saturating the networks due to the large volumes of data that such resources generate or promote the use of. The end-of-year period is an extremely sensitive sales period. A major failure of the information systems or of any component of the chain of production and logistics during that period would have negative consequences on revenues. To reduce the likelihood of this type of risk occurring, the Group avoids changes to the network and information systems during this period of the year (starting in mid-November until the end of the year), however, there can be no assurance that there will be no failure of the Group’s network and information systems during the end-of-year period. Should all or some of the risks described above materialize, this could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.14,"The Group depends on hardware, software and other providers of outsourced services, who may discontinue their services or products, seek to charge the Group prices that are not competitive or choose not to renew contracts with the Group.","The Group has important relationships with several suppliers of hardware, software and related services that we use to operate our pay-TV, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony, mobile and business services businesses. In certain cases, we have made substantial investments in the equipment or software of a particular supplier, making it difficult for the Group to quickly change supply and maintenance relationships in the event that our initial supplier refuses to offer favorable prices or ceases to produce equipment or provide the support that the Group requires. For example, while we continue to promote a rapid take up of our premium multi-play services using a single set-top box, the Group faces potential risks in securing the required customer set-top box equipment to maintain this roll out as the Group currently relies on a single provider. Currently, the Group has a sufficient supply of these boxes available, but any future shortages may involve significant delays in seeking alternative supplies, may constrain its ability to meet customer demand and may result in increased customer churn. Further, in the event that hardware or software products or related services are defective, it may be difficult or impossible to enforce recourse claims against suppliers, especially if warranties included in contracts with suppliers have expired or are exceeded by those in our contracts with the Group’s subscribers, in individual cases, or if the suppliers are insolvent, in whole or in part. In addition, there can be no assurances that the Group will be able to obtain the hardware, software and services it needs for the operation of the Group’s business in a timely manner, at competitive terms and in adequate amounts. In particular, in the case of an industry wide cyclical upturn or high demand for a particular product, the Group’s suppliers of software, hardware and other services may receive customer orders beyond the capacity of their operations, which could result in delivery delays, particularly where suppliers elect to prioritize other customer accounts. The Group has, from time to time, experienced extensions of lead times or limited supplies due to capacity constraints and other supply-related factors as well as quality control problems with service providers. The Group may also not be able to recover monies paid to such suppliers or obtain contractual damages to which the Group may be entitled (if any) in the event our suppliers fail to comply with their obligations in a timely manner. The Group also outsources some of its support services, including parts of its subscriber services, information technology support, technical services, and maintenance operations. Should any of these arrangements be terminated by either contract party, this could result in delays or disruptions to the Group’s operations and could result in it incurring additional costs, including if the outsourcing counterparty increases pricing or if the Group is required to locate alternative service providers or in-source previously outsourced services. ----- The Group is dependent on various third parties in order to provide commercially viable services. For example, the Group depends on Orange to access a portion of its network infrastructure and on Bouygues Telecom for access to certain mobile networks. The Group is generally dependent on access to sites and network infrastructure owned by third parties, including duct space and antennas used for our networks and facility space (colocation). In addition, the Group’s telephony services are reliant on its ability to interconnect with the telecommunications networks of other fixed-line, mobile and international operators globally. The Group has limited or no control over the quality and consistency of the services that are supplied to us by third parties. Any deterioration in the provision of such services may affect the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Group’s ability to renew its existing contracts with suppliers of products or services or enter into new contractual relationships with these or other suppliers upon the expiration of existing agreements, either on commercially attractive terms, or at all, depends on a range of commercial and operational factors and events which may be beyond its control. The occurrence of any of these risks or a significant disruption in the Group’s supply of equipment and services from key sourcing partners could create technical problems, damage its reputation, result in the loss of customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A

The introduction of new product offerings can initially place significant pressure on the Group’s customer service personnel. Increased pressure on such functions is generally associated with decreased satisfaction of customers. In the business services market, customers require service to be extremely reliable and to be re-established within short timeframes if there is any disruption. Penalties are often payable in the case of failure to meet expected service quality. In addition, product installation can be complex, requiring specialized knowledge and expensive equipment. Delays and service problems may result in both penalties and the potential loss of customers. In these segments, the Group relies on its experienced customer relations personnel to handle any customer issues or requests, and the loss of such personnel can result in the loss of customers. The Group has, in the past, experienced significant levels of customer dissatisfaction as a result of operational difficulties. Improvements to customer service functions may be necessary to achieve desired growth levels, and, if the Group fails to manage such improvements effectively and achieve such growth, the Group may in the future experience customer service problems and damage its reputation, contribute to increased churn and/or limit or slow the Group’s future growth.",,,,N/A
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.16,The operation of the Group’s conditional access systems is dependent on licensed technology and subject to illegal piracy risks.,"In order to transmit encrypted digital programs, including the Group’s digital pay-TV packages and for billing its customers, the Group generates conditional access systems, which rely on a proper functioning of its conditional access systems. Even though the Group requires its conditional access system providers to provide state of the art security for the conditional access systems, the security of the Group’s conditional access systems may be compromised by illegal piracy and other means. In addition, the Group’s set-top boxes require smart cards before subscribers can receive programming and its smart cards have been and may continue to be illegally duplicated, providing unlawful access to our television signals. While the Group works diligently to reduce the effect of piracy, there can be no assurance that the Group will be able to successfully eliminate the piracy it currently faces. In addition, there can be no assurance that any new conditional access system security that the Group may put in place will not be circumvented. Encryption failures could result in lower revenue, higher costs and increased basic cable subscriber churn or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.17,"If the Group fails to successfully introduce new technologies or services, or to respond to technological developments, its business and level of revenue may be adversely affected and it may not be able to recover the cost of investments that it has made.","The Group’s business is characterized by rapid technological change and the introduction of new products and services, and it is difficult to forecast the impact such technological innovations will have on our business. If any new or enhanced technologies, products or services that the Group introduces fail to achieve broad market acceptance or experience technical difficulties, the Group’s revenue growth, margins and cash flows may be ----- adversely affected. As a result, the Group may not recover investments that it makes in order to deploy these technologies and services. Enhanced fixed service infrastructure access and mobile services provided by competing operators may be more appealing to customers, and new technologies may enable the Group’s competitors to offer not only new services, but to also offer existing standard services at lower prices. The Group may not be able to fund the capital expenditures necessary to keep pace with technological developments. It is possible that alternative technologies that are more advanced than those the Group currently provides may be developed. The Group may not obtain the expected benefits of its investments if more advanced technology is adopted by the market. While the Group attempts to stay ahead of the market, closely following technological developments and making investments implementing such developments, it is difficult to forecast the effect that technical innovations will have on the Group’s business. The Group may also be unable to adapt to new or existing technologies to meet customer needs within an appropriate time frame, or a competitor may do so before us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if the Group adopts new technologies in a timely manner as they are developed, the cost of such technology may exceed their benefits. The Group’s inability to obtain the funding or other resources necessary to expand or further upgrade its systems and provide advanced services in a timely manner, or successfully anticipate the demands of the marketplace, could adversely affect the Group’s ability to attract and retain customers and generate revenue. Furthermore, given the pace of at which the Group launches new offers into the market and the multitude of its bundled service offerings, it may experience vulnerability to revenue leakage as a result of the dynamic changes in networks and IT systems. The Group’s revenue chain consists of a complex set of inter-related technologies and processes providing a seamless set of services to the end customer. Although the Group closely monitors the risks related to revenue loss and continuously improves controls in its revenue assurance processes in order to prevent and/or detect cases of revenue leakage, as the set of technologies and business processes grows bigger and more complex, the chance of failure increases in each connection of the revenue chain. Revenue leakage may have an impact on the Group’s ability to bill customers correctly for a given service or to receive the correct payment, which may adversely affect the Group’s margins and profitability. The Group anticipates that, over time, new products and services it may introduce will require upgraded or new customer premises equipment, which may constrain the Group’s ability to market and distribute such new products and services. For example, the Group does not expect that previously installed internet modems or set-top boxes will be able to support all the enhancements the Group may introduce to our broadband internet or pay-TV services over time. A portion of the Group’s subscribers will therefore require some form of upgrade or potentially a replacement of their customer premises equipment. Implementing such upgrades may entail additional costs to us and could delay the introduction of enhanced services and therefore reduce our cash flow and profitability, particularly where customers rent such customer premise equipment from us. In addition, we will need to expend significant capital expenditure to fulfil universal service obligations and to upgrade the parts of our networks that are xDSL. In particular, the Group must also continue to increase and improve the functionality, availability, and characteristics of its network, particularly by improving its bandwidth capacity and its 4G coverage, as well as the introduction of 5G technology, to meet the growing demand for the services that require very-high-speed telephony and internet services as the telecommunications industry in each of the markets in which the Group operates is facing challenges relating to: (i) rapid, significant technological evolution; (ii) frequent improvement of existing products or services resulting from the emergence of new technologies; and (iii) the establishment of new industry practices and standards that make current systems and technologies obsolete. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient capital to finance such upgrades or that such upgrades will generate a positive return. The Group may also be required to incur additional marketing and customer service costs in order to retain and attract existing customers to any upgraded products and services we offer, as well as to respond to competitors’ advertising pressure, and potentially more extensive marketing campaigns, which may adversely affect our margins.

Generally, fixed-line telephony, mobile and international operators in France are obliged by law to provide interconnection to, and not to discriminate against, any other licensed telecommunications operator. The Group has no control over the quality and timing of the investment and maintenance activities that are necessary for these entities to provide us with interconnection to their respective telecommunications networks. The failure of these or other telecommunications providers to provide reliable interconnections to us on a consistent basis and under terms that are favorable to us could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of our operations.

See “Business of the Group—Material Contracts—Wireless Network _Agreements—Bouygues Telecom Agreement”. This agreement aims to allow the two operators to offer their_ respective customers better geographic coverage and better quality of service, while optimizing costs and investments. The first deliveries of cellular plans occurred on April 30, 2014. It was at that time that each operator first became aware of the deployment plans and technical characteristics of its partner’s sites. The French Competition Authority had prohibited the exchange of technical information prior to the signing of the agreement, and the engineering guidelines had been established on the basis of assumptions that proved to be incorrect in some cases. The discussions that followed upon the initial deliveries of cellular plans led, on October 24, 2014, to adaptation of the agreement and, more specifically, of some engineering choices that had been made at the time when the initial agreement was signed. Prior to its completion, the target date for completing the network was delayed by one year, to account for the time needed to make these adjustments in the target network engineering. The target network is now expected to be completed in 2021. The Group could be exposed to various risks related to the implementation of the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement as it will be dependent upon Bouygues Telecom for the part of its network that it is to be responsible for operating. In particular, it will not have any direct operational control over the portion of the network managed by Bouygues Telecom that is to be shared. Therefore, we will not be able to control the quality of the network provided to the customers involved or to implement corrective measures necessary in the event of defect and will be exposed to the risk of failure on the part of Bouygues Telecom. In addition, the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement implemented could also fail to generate the expected synergies, especially in terms of geographic coverage or quality of service. Any delay in its implementation may affect the ability of the Group to achieve the aforementioned objectives of geographic coverage and quality of service. The implementation of the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement will also require significant capital expenditures and there can be no assurance that the Group will be able to make a return on such investment or recoup such investment. Further, in the event of partial or total cessation and/or failure of the joint arrangement, the Group would have to redeploy a network in the zones covered up to that time by the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement so as to maintain its geographic coverage and the quality of its services. Such redeployment could represent a major expense for the Group. Moreover, the Group cannot guarantee that it will be able, in such a scenario, to implement coverage equivalent to that enjoyed by customers under the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement. The competent authorities may, in the future, make decisions jeopardizing the overall economics and/or validity of the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement. Third parties may also seek to have access to the shared network and take action against the Group and its partner. On April 29, 2014, Orange filed a complaint with the French Competition Authority with regard to the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement, alleging that it constituted an anti-competitive practice. Investigations on the merits are currently underway. For more information on these ----- proceedings, see “Business of the Group—Legal Proceedings—Civil and Commercial Disputes—Wholesale _Disputes—Orange v. SFR and Bouygues Telecom (Network Sharing Agreement)”. Contract relating to the GSM-R mobile telecommunications network_ The Group holds a 30% minority stake in the company Synérail, which has entered into an agreement for a joint agreement with Réseau Ferré de France (“RFF”) for the design, construction, deployment, operation, maintenance and financing of the GSM-R mobile telecommunications network. See _“Business of the Group—Material _Contracts—Wireless Network Agreements—Agreement Related to the GSM-R Wireless Telecommunications Network”. The GSM-R project aims to set up a private telecommunications network dedicated to the needs of_ professionals in rail transport. It enables a European network to be created having a single communications system that is compatible and harmonized among the rail networks, replacing the existing national radio systems. This contract, with a term of 15 years starting March 24, 2010 and for a total amount of €1 billion, provides for the gradual deployment of this network. The Group is also involved as service provider in the operating phase of the GSM-R network. Delays in deployment caused by the Group or an inability to achieve the targets provided for in the contract could put the Group at risk under its contractual obligations to its key partners which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position, results of operations or outlook.",,,,N/A
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",1.1.20,The Group is dependent on its national distribution network.,"The Group distribute our products and services meant for the general public and businesses directly or indirectly through our national distribution network. Within the framework of our B2C activity, such distribution occurs mainly through our spaces. For indirect distribution of our services, we rely on independent partners, in which we directly or indirectly hold minority stakes. In particular, the French telecommunications market is characterized by rapid change in the habits and needs of customers. Therefore, the Group is committed to adapting its distribution network accordingly in order to respond to new market characteristics. This evolution of the distribution network involves regular adaptation of indirect distribution and thus on the part of all of its independent partners. However, some of them might not have the ability or might not wish to implement the necessary adaptations. In addition, the Group is engaged in significant disputes with former or current partners, particularly demands to re-characterize agreements for joint arrangements as commercial agent agreements, to obtain compensation due to breakdowns in commercial relations, and to invoke the status of management employee, as well as demands from its own employees for recognition of the Group’s status as employer and for application of the employment status applicable inside of the “SFR Social and Economic Unit” (“UES”) convention. The Group has already implemented policies for adapting its contractual tools in order to prevent such risks and manage tailored protective policies, however it cannot guarantee that such claims will not increase or that the factual or legal arguments put forward by the Group to rebut these claims will be received favorably by the courts. In particular, the Group may be obligated to apply its employment status outside its current UES convention.

In this respect, the Group has generally obtained leases, rights and licenses from network operators, including incumbent operators, governmental authorities and individuals. For example, in January 2014, we entered into the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement to share a portion of our mobile networks. See “Business of the Group— _Material Contracts—Wireless Network Agreements—Bouygues Telecom Agreement”. The Group is dependent on_ Orange to access a portion of our network infrastructure, on Bouygues Telecom to access certain mobile networks and on Canal+ Group, with which we have entered into a number of contracts, for the supply of content. These contracts are generally subject to rights of termination upon sufficient notice, in the event of a material breach or upon the commencement of liquidation or insolvency proceedings. In the event that the Group is unable to reach agreements with third parties or favorably renegotiate or renew our existing roaming, network sharing agreements or other agreements on terms we believe are reasonable, our fixed-based and mobile services may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of ----- operations.

The Group also employ the services of subcontractors to maintain our network, manage our call centres, and supply, install, and maintain equipment set up at private households and at the premises of business services customers. The Group cannot guarantee the quality of such services or that these services will comply with the quality and safety standards we impose or require. If there are defects in the equipment or software or the services involving these products, or if the tasks of our subcontractors are not performed properly, it may be difficult or even impossible to make a claim against the suppliers or subcontractors, particularly if the warranties provided for in the contracts entered into with suppliers or subcontractors are not as extensive as those contained in the contracts entered into between us and our customers in certain specific cases or if these suppliers or subcontractors are insolvent or have suspended payments. These difficulties could undermine relations between us and our customers, as well as the reputation of our brand. Any delay or failure by our third parties suppliers in providing services or products, any increase in their prices, or any decision not to renew their contracts with us could lead to delays or interruptions in our activities. In addition, in many cases we make significant investments in the equipment or software of a particular supplier, which makes it more difficult to rapidly change our procurements or maintenance services if our original supplier refuses to offer us favorable prices or ceases to produce equipment or provide services that we require.

The Group remains attentive to_ environmental risks that might arise or be discovered in the future and it has adopted programs aimed at ensuring compliance with applicable environmental regulations. Environmental and health concerns are expressed in numerous countries and particularly arise in the context of the deployment of mobile technology regarding exposure to electromagnetic fields through telecommunications equipment, relay antennas and Wifi. A number of studies have been conducted to examine the health effects of mobile phone use and network sites, and some of these studies have been construed as indicating that radiation from mobile phone use causes adverse health effects. The World Health Organization has classified the radiofrequency of electromagnetic fields, linked particularly with the use of cordless phones, as “possibly carcinogenic to humans”, but, to date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use. Several lawsuits have been filed against mobile operators and other participants in the mobile industry alleging adverse health effects and other claims relating to radio frequency transmissions to and from sites, handsets and other mobile telecommunications devices. The perception of increased health risks related to mobile network sites may also cause the Group increased difficulty in obtaining leases for new mobile network site locations or renewing leases for existing locations or otherwise in installing mobile telecommunication devices. The fears generated by the potential health risks connected with electromagnetic waves could also lead third parties to act against the Group by, for example, bringing actions demanding the withdrawal of antennas or towers, which could ----- affect the Group’s conduct of operations and the deployment of our network, and could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position and results of operations. If it is ever determined that health risks existed or that there was a deviation from radiation standards which would result in a health risk from sites, other mobile technology or handsets, this would have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations, including through exposure to potential liability, a reduction in subscribers and reduced usage per subscriber.

The Group has developed the brands it uses through extensive marketing campaigns, website promotions, customer referrals, and the use of a dedicated sales force and dealer networks. For a description of the Group’s brands and offers, see “Business of _the Group—Suppliers”._ These brands have been developed through extensive marketing campaigns, website promotions and customer referrals, and the use of a dedicated sales force and dealer networks. The Group’s success depends on its ability to maintain and enhance the image and reputation of its existing products and services and to develop a favorable image and reputation for new products and services. The image and reputation of the Group’s products and services may be adversely affected by several factors, including if concerns arise about (i) the quality, reliability and benefit/cost balance of its products and services, (ii) the quality of its support centers or (iii) its ability to deliver the level of service advertised. An event or series of events that threatens the reputation of one or more of the Group’s brands, or one or more of the Group’s products could have an adverse effect on the value of that brand or product and subsequent revenues therefrom. Restoring the image and reputation of the Group’s products and services may be costly and not always possible. The Group relies upon copyright, trademark and patent laws to establish and protect its intellectual property rights, but no assurance can be given that the actions they have taken or will take in the future will be adequate to prevent violation of our intellectual property rights. Adverse publicity, legal action or other factors could lead to substantial erosion in the value of the Group’s brand, which could lead to decreased consumer demand and have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, results of operations or financial condition and prospects.

High levels of sovereign debt in the U.S. and certain European countries combined with weak growth and high unemployment could lead to fiscal reforms (including austerity measures), sovereign debt restructurings, currency instability, increased counterparty credit risk, high levels of volatility and, potentially, disruptions in the credit and equity markets as well as other outcomes that might adversely impact our business and financial operations. In Europe, future developments are dependent upon a number of political and economic factors, including the effectiveness of measures by the EU Commission to address debt burdens of certain countries in Europe and the overall stability of the Eurozone. The current macroeconomic environment is highly volatile, and continuing instability in global markets, including instability related to international trade, tariffs, sovereign debt issues, the risk of deflation and the stability of the euro, has contributed to a challenging global economic environment. As France seeks to recover from any natural disasters and pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or the French government seeks new sources of revenue due to high fiscal deficit, the government may impose new or increased taxes and levies. Accordingly, ----- our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected if the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain or declines further or the government increases taxes or levies as a result of fiscal deficits, pandemics or natural disasters. We are currently unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects. Furthermore, we rely on third-party vendors for the equipment (including customer premises equipment, telecommunications equipment, network infrastructure and mobile handsets), software and services that we require in order to provide services to our customers. Our suppliers often conduct business worldwide and their ability to meet our needs is subject to various risks, including political and economic instability, international regulations or sanctions, natural calamities, interruptions in transportation systems or power supplies, terrorism, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and labor issues. With regard to currency instability issues, concerns exist in the Eurozone with respect to individual macro fundamentals on a country-by-country basis, as well as with respect to the overall stability of the European monetary union and the suitability of a single currency to appropriately deal with specific fiscal management and sovereign debt issues in individual Eurozone countries. Following Brexit on January 31, 2020, the U.K. entered into a transition period set to terminate on December 31, 2020 during which it will continue to apply European Union law. Thereafter, the effects of Brexit will depend, in part, on agreements the U.K negotiates during the transitional period to retain access to markets in the European Union, including current trade and finance agreements. Brexit has created substantial political uncertainty within the European Union, uncertainty in international financial markets and reduced economic growth in certain jurisdictions. It is possible that other members of the European monetary union could hold similar referendums regarding their membership within the Eurozone in the future. The realization of these concerns could lead to the exit of one or more countries from the European monetary union and the re-introduction of individual currencies in these countries or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely, which could result in the redenomination of a portion or, in the extreme case, all of the Group’s euro-denominated assets, liabilities and cash flows to the new currency of the country in which they originated. This could result in a mismatch in the currencies of the Group’s assets, liabilities and cash flows. Any such mismatch, together with the capital market disruption that would likely accompany any such redenomination event, could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s liquidity and financial condition. Furthermore, any redenomination event would likely be accompanied by significant economic dislocation, particularly within the Eurozone countries, which in turn could have an adverse impact on demand for our products and, accordingly, on our revenue and cash flows. Moreover, any changes from euro to non-euro currencies in countries would require the Group to modify its billing and other financial systems. No assurance can be given that any required modifications could be made within a timeframe that would allow the Group to timely bill its customers or prepare and file required financial reports. In light of the significant exposure that the Group has to the euro through its euro-denominated borrowings, derivative instruments, cash balances and cash flows, a redenomination event could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business. On November 8, 2013, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services downgraded France’s sovereign debt rating by one notch to AA, where it currently stands. On December 13, 2014, France was downgraded by Fitch by one notch to AA, where it currently stands. On September 18, 2015, France was downgraded by Moody’s by one notch to Aa2, where it currently stands. There can be no guarantee that there will not be a downgrade of France’s sovereign debt rating in the future. Poor performance of the French economy, particularly due to a possible resurgence of the Eurozone debt crisis, could have a direct negative impact on consumer spending habits and on businesses in relation to products and their usage levels. Such poor performance could (i) make it more difficult for the Group to capture new subscribers and customers, (ii) increase the likelihood that some subscribers or customers of the Group might reduce the level of subscribed services or terminate their subscriptions and (iii) make it more difficult for the Group to keep its prices at current levels. Negative macroeconomic developments in France, in particular increasing levels of unemployment, may have a direct negative impact on the spending patterns of retail consumers, both in terms of the products they subscribe for and usage levels. Because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from residential subscribers who may be impacted by these conditions, it may be more difficult to attract new subscribers and more likely that certain of the Group’s subscribers will downgrade or disconnect their services. In addition, we can provide no assurances that a deterioration of any of these economies will not lead to a higher number of non-paying customers or generally result in service disconnections. Similarly, a deterioration in economic conditions would be likely to adversely affect the demand for, and pricing of, our business services as a result of businesses and governments reducing spending. Therefore, a weak economy and negative economic development in the French markets may jeopardize our growth targets and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and ----- results of operations. In addition, adverse economic conditions (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic) may lead to a rise in the number of our customers who are not able to pay for our services. Each of the above-mentioned risks has been heightened by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world economy.",,,,N/A

The severity and timing of the impact will depend on a number of factors, including the level and rapidity of infection, duration of the pandemic and related containment measures, changes in consumer spending patterns, measures imposed or taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, macroeconomic conditions in our markets, and negative effects on the financial condition of our customers, suppliers and vendors. Under difficult economic conditions, including prolonged unemployment and employment furloughs, demand for our products and services could decline and some customers may be unable or unwilling to pay for our products and services. Additionally, in order to prioritize the demands of the business and/or depending on any restrictions that may be imposed by the French government on deployment of new infrastructure, we may, or may be required to, delay certain capital investments, such as FTTH or in other new initiatives, products or services, which may adversely affect our business in the future. If these events occur and were to continue, our revenue may be reduced materially which could result in reduced operating margins and a reduction in cash flows. Governmental and non-governmental initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of restrictions on work and public gatherings and the promotion of social distancing, along with certain temporary regulations concerning collections, or changes in consumer behaviour, have impacted and could continue to impact our operations and financial results. Even though the strict lockdown in France was lifted on May 11, 2020, significant restrictions and social distancing measures remain in place, which continue to adversely affect the overall French economy and, in turn, our operations. If a significant portion of our workforce is unable to work effectively due to prolonged illness, quarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements, government actions, facility closures or other reasons in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations could be further materially impacted. Our suppliers and vendors also may be affected by such measures in their ability to provide products and services to us and these measures could also make it more difficult for us to serve our customers. It is unclear whether measures taken by the French government to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in France are adequate and will be effective in achieving their goals. It is unclear when, if at all, the COVID-19 pandemic will be contained. We have implemented enhanced health and safety measures in our operations in line with public health rules and guidelines and industry practices to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the increase in costs associated with the implementation of such measures, we are also exposed to the risk of an increase in the number of workplace and third-party claims arising from actual or alleged failures to implement such measures adequately, or at all, and a potential increase in legal, advisory and other costs as a result of any COVID-19 pandemic related claims from workers or third party customers and suppliers that may come into contact with our operations. Financial markets have been experiencing extreme fluctuations that may cause a contraction in available liquidity globally as important segments of the markets react to the development. The pandemic may lead to a decline in business and consumer confidence and presents the risk of an economic recession in France and around the globe, which could adversely impact our results. Further, political repercussions of responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by European Union institutions as well as by other countries in the European Union could have complex and hard-to-predict consequences for the future, including a destabilization of the European Union or its institutions or a slow-down or reversal of European integration. In addition, the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, financial condition and results of operations could exacerbate the other risks identified in this Offering Memorandum. -----",,,,N/A

These estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are considered by our management to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time. These estimates and assumptions form the basis of judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Areas requiring more complex judgments may shift over time based on changes business mix and industry practice which could affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. In addition, management’s judgments, estimates and assumptions and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses may be affected by changes in accounting policy. In January 2016, the IASB issued a new standard coming into effect on January 1, 2019, IFRS 16 (Leases), which has superseded the current standard (IAS 17) and its current interpretations. IFRS 16 specifies how to recognize, measure, present and disclose leases. The standard provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a sufficiently low value. IFRS 16 applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. The Group has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective method, with the date of initial application of January 1, 2019. Under this method, the standard is applied retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of the initial application. IFRS 16 had a significant impact on our consolidated statement of financial position from periods beginning on January 1, 2019, due to the recognition of rights-of-use related to leased assets and corresponding lease liabilities. Moreover, our consolidated statement of profit or loss was impacted as operating lease expenses no longer comprise a part of operating expenses, but instead fall under depreciation and interest expenses. The Group’s consolidated statement of cash flows was also impacted given that payment for lease liabilities is now presented within financing activities. The principal effects of the application of IFRS 16 on our consolidated statement of financial position and results of operations as of January 1, 2019, were a recognition of right-of-use (“ROU”) assets of €3,233 million which include the lease assets in the amount of €121 million previously recognized under finance leases and reclassified from the property, plant and equipment and intangible assets line items, and an increase in lease liabilities by €3,214 million, of which the current and non-current liabilities increased by €663 million and €2,551 million, respectively. The Group has completed its assessment of IFRS 16 with respect to subsurfacing rights and has concluded that in its relevant contracts, the suppliers have a substantive right to substitute the asset throughout the period of use and therefore, such contracts do not constitute a lease. For further details on new accounting standards that may have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements, see note 1.2 to the 2019 Financial Statements and note 1.2 to the Unaudited Financial Statements, in each case, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The Group is closely monitoring the work of IASB and the IFRS Interpretation Committee, aiming to clarify interpretation of IFRS 16, which could lead to a revision of the accounting policies applied by the Group.",,,,N/A

As of June 30, 2020, after giving effect to the Transactions, the Group had total third party debt (excluding other long term and short term liabilities, other than finance lease liabilities prior to giving effect to IFRS 16) of €18,636 million (comprising of the Notes offered hereby, the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Term Loans, the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities, the 2019 Hivory Senior Revolving Facilities and finance leases and other liabilities (prior to giving effect to IFRS 16). See “Capitalization.” For a description of such changes to our financial profile and our third party indebtedness, see “Description of Other Indebtedness”. The Group’s significant level of debt could have important consequences, including, but not limited to, the following: - requiring the Group to devote a significant portion of its cash flow deriving from its operations to the repayment of its debt, thus reducing the availability of the Group’s cash flows for financing internal growth using working capital and investments and for other general business requirements; - impeding the Group’s ability to compete with other providers of pay-TV, broadband internet services, fixed line telephony services, mobile services and business services in the regions in which it operates; - restricting the Group from exploiting business opportunities or making acquisitions or investments; - increasing the vulnerability of the Group to a business slowdown or to economic or industrial circumstances; - limiting the Group’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its business and its sector; - adversely affecting public perception of the Group and its brands; - limiting the ability of the Group to make investments in its growth, especially those aimed at modernizing its network; and - in particular, limiting the Group’s ability to borrow additional funds in the future and to increase the costs of such additional financing, especially due to restrictive clauses in our current debt agreements.

If the Group is not able to meet its debt service obligations, it might have to sell off assets, attempt to restructure or refinance its existing debt or seek additional financing in the form of debt or equity. The Group may not be able to do so in a satisfactory manner, or at all.",,,,N/A

These covenants restrict the Group’s ability, and the ability of its subsidiaries, to, among other things: - pay dividends or make other distributions; - make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures; - make capital expenditures; - engage in transactions with affiliates and other related parties; - dispose of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; - merge with other companies; - incur additional debt and grant guarantees; - repurchase or redeem equity interests and subordinated debt or issue shares of subsidiaries; and ----- - grant liens and pledge assets. All of these limitations are subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, including the ability to pay dividends, make investments or to make significant prepayments of shareholder debt. However, these covenants could limit the Group’s ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and the Group’s ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. In addition, the Group’s ability to comply with these restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the Group is also subject to the affirmative covenants contained in certain of the debt agreements it is a party to, which requires us to maintain specified leverage ratios, see “Description of Other Indebtedness”. The Group’s ability to meet these leverage ratios may be affected by events beyond its control and, as a result, the Group cannot assure you that it will be able to meet these ratios. In addition to limiting our flexibility in operating our business, the breach of any covenants or obligations under the agreements and instruments governing the Group’s debt may result in a default under the applicable debt agreement or instrument and could trigger the acceleration of related debt, which in turn could trigger defaults under agreements governing our other debt. A default under any of the agreements governing our other debt could materially adversely affect our growth, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A

16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.2,Risks Relating to the Group’s Financial Profile,1.2.5,The Group is exposed to interest rate risks. Shifts in such rates may adversely affect its debt service obligations.,"The Group is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates, primarily under the Existing Term Loans. In addition, any amounts the Group borrows under the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities will bear interest at a floating rate. See “Description of Other Indebtedness”. An increase in the interest rates on the Group’s debt will reduce the funds available to repay its debt and to finance its operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities. The Group enters into various derivative transactions to manage exposure to movements in interest rates; however, there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost. There can be no guarantee that the Group’s hedging strategies will adequately protect the Group from the effects of interest rate fluctuation, or that these hedges will not limit any benefit that we might otherwise receive from favorable movements in interest rates. Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. The ----- potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including, but not limited to, the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities and/or the Existing Term Loans having interest rates that are linked to LIBOR or EURIBOR, as applicable). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the Group’s ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest.",,,,N/A
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.2,Risks Relating to the Group’s Financial Profile,1.2.6,Changes or uncertainty in respect of LIBOR may affect the Group’s sources of funding.,"Some of the Group’s sources of funding are linked to LIBOR. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Term _Loans” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Revolving Credit Facilities”. Various interest rate benchmarks_ (including LIBOR) are the subject of recent regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented, including the EU Benchmark Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011). In addition, the sustainability of LIBOR has been questioned by the FCA as a result of the absence of relevant active underlying markets and possible disincentives (including possibly as a result of regulatory reforms) for market participants to continue contributing to such benchmarks. On November 29, 2017, the Bank of England and the FCA announced that the market Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Rates would have an extended mandate to catalyze a broad transition to the Sterling Over Night Index Average rate (“SONIA”) across sterling bond, loan and derivatives markets so that SONIA is established as the primary sterling interest rate benchmark by the end of 2021. The Bank of England and FCA have stated that a key near-term priority for the Working Group will be to make recommendations relating to the potential development of term SONIA reference rates. These reforms and other pressures may cause such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Based on the foregoing, investors should in particular be aware that: - any of the reforms or pressures described above or any other changes to a relevant interest rate benchmark (including LIBOR) could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause it to be lower and/or more volatile than it would otherwise be; and - if LIBOR is discontinued, then the rate of interest applicable to the Group’s sources of funding may be determined for a period by applicable fall-back provisions, although such provisions, often being dependent in part upon the provision by reference banks of offered quotations for the LIBOR rate, may not operate as intended (depending on market circumstances and the availability of rates information at the relevant time) and may in certain circumstances result in the effective application of a fixed rate based on the rate which applied in the previous period when LIBOR was available. More generally, any of the above matters or any other significant change to the setting or existence of LIBOR could affect the Group’s ability to meet our obligations under the Group’s sources of funding and/or could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of, and the amount payable under, the Group’s sources of funding. See also “—The Group is exposed to interest rate risks.

The primary transactional currency of the Group is euro and most of the Group’s revenues and operating cash flows are in euro. The Group conducts, and will continue to conduct, transactions in currencies other than such primary transactional currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar. A significant portion of the Group’s existing debt is denominated in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro has fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. The Group has historically covered a portion of our U.S. dollar cash outflows arising on anticipated and committed obligations through the use of foreign exchange derivative instruments. Further, while we manage the risk of certain currency fluctuations in respect of a portion of our existing debt and to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes in respect of indebtedness linked to interest rates, these arrangements may be costly and may not insulate us completely from such exposure.

The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed herein and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of such Notes. A downgrade in our credit rating may negatively affect the Group’s ability to obtain future financing to fund our operations and capital needs, which may affect our liquidity. It may also increase our financing costs by increasing the interest rates of our outstanding debt or the interest rates at which it is able to refinance existing debt or incur additional debt. There can be no assurance that the Group’s corporate rating, or the instrument rating with respect to the Notes, will be maintained at existing levels. See “—Risks Relating to the Notes—Credit ratings may not _reflect all risks”._ Because the financial condition, revenues and profitability of our operating subsidiaries are closely linked to the economies of their countries of operations, we expect that the Group as a whole will also be impacted by any downgrading in the sovereign debt rating of such countries.

Such regulation and supervision, as well as future changes in laws or regulations or in their interpretation or enforcement that affect us, our competitors or our industry, strongly influence how we operate our business. Complying with existing and future law and regulations may increase our operational and administrative expenses, restrict the Group’s ability or make it more difficult to implement price increases, affect the Group’s ability to introduce new services, force us to change our marketing and other business practices, and/or otherwise limit our revenues. In particular, our business could be materially and adversely affected by any changes in relevant laws or regulations (or in their interpretation) regarding, for example, licensing requirements, access and price regulation, interconnection arrangements or the imposition of universal service obligations, or any change in policy allowing more favorable conditions for other operators or increasing competition. There can be no assurance to you that the provision of our services will not be subject to greater regulation in the future. Furthermore, a failure to comply with the applicable rules and regulations could result in penalties, restrictions on our business or loss of required licenses or other adverse consequences. Although the regulations applicable to our business vary, such regulations may include, amongst other things: - price regulation for certain of the services we offer, exit fees and cancellation charges; - rules governing the interconnection between different telephone networks and the interconnection rates that we can charge and that we pay; - requirements that, under specified circumstances, a cable system carry certain broadcast stations or obtain consent to carry a broadcast station; - rules for authorizations, licensing, acquisitions, renewals and transfers of licenses and franchises; - requirements that we provide or contribute to the provision of certain universal services; - rules and regulations relating to subscriber privacy and data protection; ----- - rules and regulations relating to our networks, including universal access obligations imposed on us, coinstallation and co-location obligations (including our submarine cable landing stations), right of way and ownership considerations; - rules governing the copyright royalties; requirements on portability; and - other requirements covering a variety of operational areas such as equal employment opportunity, emergency alert systems, disability access, technical standards, environmental standards, city planning rules and customer service and consumer protection requirements. The regulations applicable to our operations within the EU often derive from EU Directives. The various Directives require EU Member States to harmonize their laws on communications and cover such issues as access, user rights, privacy and competition. These Directives are reviewed by the EU from time to time and any changes to them could lead to substantial changes in the way in which our business is regulated and to which we would have to adapt. In addition, the Group is subject to antitrust rules and regulations and are, from time to time, subject to review by authorities concerning whether we exhibit monopoly power in any of the market in which we operate. To the extent that the Group is deemed by relevant authorities to exhibit significant market power, we can be subject to various regulatory obligations adversely affecting our results of operations and profitability. Regulatory authorities may also require the Group to grant third parties access to our bandwidth, frequency capacity, facilities or services to distribute their own services or resell our services to end customers. Currently, the Group is considered to have significant market power in France. No assurance can be given that we will not be identified as having significant market power in the future and we will not be subject to additional regulatory requirements.",,,,N/A
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.3,Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters,1.3.2,Future regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business.,"The Group is subject to the provisions of the French Postal and Electronic Communications Code (“CPCE”), which imposes certain general obligations on all operators and certain specific obligations on mobile operators. The French regulatory framework applicable to operators is also subject to the analysis of the relevant markets carried out by the French telecom regulator (“ARCEP”) which is charged with (i) defining the relevant markets in France, (ii) analyzing the markets or identifying the companies reputed for exercising significant influence on these markets and (iii) deciding whether or not to impose on these companies regulatory obligations to remedy the effects of such influence. The Group is not considered by ARCEP to be an operator deemed to have significant influence over a relevant market, except over the markets for voice-call termination on its fixed and mobile networks. Nevertheless, it cannot be guaranteed that the Group, in the future, will not be identified by ARCEP as an operator deemed to exercise significant power in one or more relevant markets, and that ARCEP will not therefore impose additional regulatory obligations in this regard. For example, the possibility cannot be excluded that, in the future, particularly in the context of a growth in FTTH networks, the Group may be required to grant competitors some access to its fiber optic network, under conditions to be determined. At the request of the French Competition Authority, ARCEP has recently issued an opinion addressing the issues raised by the digital revolution currently affecting the audiovisual sector (ARCEP opinion dated October 11, 2018). In this document, ARCEP provided an overview of audiovisual content broadcasting techniques (DTT, copper and fiber networks, satellite, OTT and cable networks) before detailing the sector’s recent evolutions at both the operator and consumer ends, emphasizing the necessity to determine a common technical framework for these new services. ARCEP has not provided a timeline for the determination of such framework and has recommended the implementation of a horizontal regulation for all devices allowing access to audiovisual content. As the technical framework develops, the Group may be subject to ongoing obligations. The Group is also subject to other individual obligations resulting from the approvals to use frequencies. See “— _The Group can only operate its business for as long as it has licenses from the relevant authorities and it may not be able to obtain, retain or review the licenses and authorizations necessary for conducting its activities.”_ In September 2017, the French government asked ARCEP to begin work on the binding commitments that mobile operators were likely to make, above and beyond their existing rollout plans. Based on ARCEP’s proposals, and as part of a dialogue with mobile network operators, the French Government reached an agreement that aims to ----- ensure the availability of a high standard of mobile coverage for every person in France. With respect to these elements, mobile operators have committed to: - improving reception quality across the entire country, and particularly in rural areas. The new baseline quality standard applied to operators’ obligations will be that of “good coverage”; - increasing the pace of targeted programmes for improving coverage, with each operator deploying at least 5,000 new cell sites across the country to this end, some of which will be shared, which will henceforth go beyond so-called “white areas” and for which operators will now be fully responsible. Over the next three years, we will bring coverage to as many areas as the total number covered by government programmes over the past fifteen years. Government authorities will work closely with local authorities to identify the areas that need to be covered; - achieving ubiquitous 4G coverage, which will mean bringing it to more than a million additional people in 10,000 municipalities in France, by making every cell site 4G-capable; - accelerating the coverage of transportation routes, so that all of the major roads and railways have 4G coverage. The agreement also provides for coverage on regional railway lines; and - achieving ubiquitous indoor telephone coverage, notably by using voice over Wi-Fi. Facilitated by an increase of network sharing which ensures more efficient rollouts, along with a planned simplification of the measures contained in the new housing bill, stepping up the pace of deployment for new mobile phone equipment will significantly improve the user experience of mobile coverage in every part of the country. On July 3, 2018, ARCEP handed down a decision (decision no. 2018-0684) setting out the conditions under which licenses for 900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2100 GHz-band frequencies may be granted in 2021, 2022 and 2024. One of these conditions is that operators are required to take actions to achieve the goals set out in Articles L. 32 et seq. of the CPCE (digital development of the French territory, fair and effective competition between operators on the mobile market and effective management and use of the frequency spectrum). Mobile operator frequency licences granted in July 2018 are now binding and a failure to meet these new obligations will result in sanctions from ARCEP. On June 4, 2019, ARCEP updated its mobile new deal roadmap underlining the priority of deploying and/or enhancing the quality of mobile coverage on highways and other strategic transport networks. On July 12, 2019, a new decree regarding network coverage obligations was passed. This decree identifies specific interests locations (strategic sites) that must be covered by mobile networks or in which the quality of the services provided must be improved by the operators. The decree no. 2019-1592 of December 31, 2019, initiated the 5G public tender and the ministerial decree of December 30, 2019 determined modalities and conditions for the tender. 31 frequencies in the 10 MHz band will be allocated as follows: - Four blocks of 50 MHz are expected to be allocated at a set price provided the operators agree on several commitments detailed in the tender specifications; and - The remaining frequencies will be allocated through an auction process, per blocks of 10 MHz. SFR, Orange, Free Mobile and Bouygues Telecom have agreed to obtain one of the four blocks of 50 MHz (comprising five blocks of 10 MHz each). On April 2, 2020, ARCEP announced that: - the four candidates were qualified; ----- - the four candidates had made the commitments set out in the specifications, and each will be able to obtain a block of 50 MHz at the end of this procedure, for the sum of €350 million. The four candidates are now authorised to participate in the auction stage, during which the 11 blocks of 10 MHz that remain available in the 3.4 – 3.8 GHz band will be awarded. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the main auction to award the remaining 11 blocks of 10 MHz have been postponed. Their allocation is scheduled to be launched on September 29, 2020. The Group monitors the regulations to which it is subject; however, the weight of the regulatory burden on “electronic” telecommunications operators, including the Group, may change and may lead to the application of different obligations in their regard depending on the level of ownership of direct access networks and the level of market power that may be more or less significant to or constrictive upon certain operators by virtue of changes in the technology used for providing services. If the Group becomes subject to regulations relatively more constrictive than its competitors, this could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial position. Furthermore, as an “electronic” telecommunications operator and a distributor of television services, the Group is subject to special taxes. The burden of such taxes could increase in the future due to changes in legislation. In addition, the Group cannot guarantee that additional taxes will not be instituted in the telecommunications industry. Any future restrictions on the Group’s ability to market its products or services in the way it wishes could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial position.",,,,N/A
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.3,Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters,1.3.3,The European Commission’s “Digital Single Market” legislation could adversely affect the Group’s businesses.,"The EU Regulation 531/2012, which initially set a rate for roaming, was further amended through the regulation 2015/2120 of 25/11/2015 to establish the conditions and the viability of a removal of retail roaming charges from June 15, 2017 (“roam like at home” subject to fair-usage). Moreover, the regulation introduces measures relating to “net neutrality”. Furthermore, the roaming regulation was completed by other pieces of legislation: - Implementing regulation EU 2016/2286 of 15/12/2016 laying down detailed rules on the application of fair use policy and on the methodology for assessing the sustainability of the abolition of retail roaming surcharges and on the application to be submitted by a roaming provider for the purposes of that assessment; and - Regulation UE 2017/920 of 17/05/2017 amending Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 with respect to rules for wholesale roaming markets. The Commission’s proposals on telecommunications markets presented in September 2016 intends to fix rules to support the creation of Gigabit Society. The electronic communications code proposal aims to make investment in very high capacity networks a binding objective and it also aims to promote sustainable long term competition. It was adopted through Directive 2018/1972 of December 11, 2018 establishing the European Electronic Communications Code (the “EECC”), which entered into force on December 20, 2018. This legislation is expected to have both a positive and adverse effect on revenue generated from the Group’s operations due to anticipated price decreases, higher operational costs and increased competition. All of these factors may adversely affect the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The EECC brings together the rules on electronic communications networks and services and aligns them with the latest technological developments. The EECC regulates (i) electronic communications networks and services (“ECN” and “ECS”), (ii) associated facilities and services, (iii) the authorisation of networks and services, (iv) radio spectrum use and numbering resources, (v) access to and interconnection of electronic communications networks and associated facilities and (vi) the protection of end-users. It aims to: - Promote connectivity, access to and take-up of very high capacity networks by all citizens and businesses of the EU; - Promote competition in the provision of electronic communication networks and services; ----- - Contribute to the development of the internal market in the field of electronic communications networks and services, radio spectrum, and connectivity; and - Promote the interests of European citizens. The EECC has singled out citizen connectivity as a key objective for the EU, since it is instrumental in guaranteeing freedom of expression, pluralism, democracy, culture, social cohesion, and even safety. The EECC also adopts a broader definition of ECS to regulate services delivered via internet (known as “over-the-top” or “OTT” services). ECS now includes internet access services, interpersonal communications services (“ICS”), and services consisting wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals. The EECC also provides for strategic planning and coordination of a radio spectrum policy, as well as for effective management of radio spectrum by Member States. Finally, national regulation authorities are responsible for ensuring access, interconnection, and the interoperability of services. Consequently, and under certain circumstances, they can impose on undertakings obligations such as interconnecting networks, ensuring the interoperability of their services and granting physical access to their infrastructure. A public concertation was initiated on December 2019 with regard to the transposition into French national law of the EECC. The concertation covers the following topics: - the maximum duration of the contracts between customers and service providers, - framing the conditions under which bundled offers (mobile phone and plan) can be offered to the customers, - the regulation of added value services, - the termination conditions (to ensure that termination provisions do not carry any deterrent effect), and - the conditions under which service providers who refuse to respect the provisions of the EECC (number portability, change of operator, etc.) can be sanctioned. Member States must enact the EECC into their national laws by December 21, 2020. As of the date hereof, France has not yet enacted EECC into its national laws.",,,,N/A
16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.3,Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters,1.3.4,The legal status of the Group’s network is complex and in certain cases subject to challenges or renewals.,"The legal status of the Group’s network is complex and the network is mainly governed by public law, which could affect the predictability of the Group’s rights over its network. For a description of the legal status of the Group’s cable network see “Regulation—Legal Status of Networks”. The Group’s telecommunications network is essentially composed of the physical infrastructure (conduits, network head-ends, switches and radio frequency stations) in which telecommunications (mainly cable) equipment is installed. These components of the Group’s network are subject to different legal regimes. As the Group does not own certain land where such physical infrastructures are located and infrastructure is established on public or private property, it has entered into concessions, rights-of-way, leases or even IRUs with the owners of the land. In order to establish a substantial part of its telecommunications network and of its wireless network, the Group has thus entered into public and private property occupancy agreements with public and private entities or holds public property occupancy permits. Under these agreements or permits, the Group may install its network equipment along roads, highways, railways or canals, for example. No transfer of ownership takes place within this framework. Such agreements are entered into for terms that vary greatly, from 3 to 25 years. The Group does not have any right to renewal of such agreements, although the agreements with the shortest terms generally provide for tacit renewal. The Group’s occupancy of public property, as is the case for all occupants of public property, is always precarious and subject to considerations beyond the Group’s control. The public entities with which the Group has entered into these agreements or that have issued permits to it can thus at any time terminate these public property occupancy agreements for misconduct or for reasons of public interest and some of the agreements even exclude any compensation in such case. ----- If the Group fails to obtain such renewal, the company involved would be obliged, upon expiration of these agreements, (i) to return the site to its original condition upon the demand of the manager or owner of the public property involved and/or (ii) to transfer to the latter, in certain cases for the payment of compensation and in certain cases free of charge, ownership of the facilities established on the property involved.

These authorizations generally require that we comply with applicable laws and regulations, meet certain solvency requirements and maintain minimum levels of service. Should the Group fail to comply with these, it may be subject to financial penalties from the relevant authorities and there may also be a risk that licenses could be partially or totally withdrawn. The imposition of fines and/or the withdrawal of licenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and prevent us from conducting the Group’s business. In addition, such authorizations are generally granted for fixed terms and must be periodically renewed. The procedure for obtaining or renewing these licenses can be long and costly and authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition for renewal. In addition, these licenses may not be obtainable or renewable in a timely manner or at all. In some instances, such authorizations have not been renewed at expiration, and we have operated and are operating under either temporary operating agreements or without an authorization while negotiating renewal terms with the local franchising authorities. Should we not be able to obtain or renew the licenses needed to operate or develop our business in a timely fashion, the Group’s ability to realize our strategic objectives may be compromised. In certain cases the Group’s mobile licenses require it to comply with certain obligations (population coverage, sharing in certain areas, national roaming) and the Group may suffer adverse consequences if is not able to comply with these obligations. In certain countries, we have provided significant bank guarantees to guarantee our performance under our licenses. If the Group is found to be in material breach of our licenses, the guarantees may be forfeited and our licenses may be revoked. Some of the Group’s activities depend on obtaining or renewing licences issued by regulatory authorities, particularly ARCEP in the telecommunications field and CSA in the audiovisual field. Under the licences allocated to the Group’s subsidiaries, the latter have committed themselves to complying with certain obligations (population coverage, sharing in some areas, roaming allowance). The Group is required to deploy a 3G and 4G generation radio network adhering to certain rates of coverage for the metropolitan population according to a given timetable. Within the framework of its 4G licences, if certain conditions are met, the Group will eventually have to allow Free Mobile roaming on a portion of its 4G network. The Group will also have to provide coverage, in conjunction with other 800 MHz band holders and under its 2G licence, for the city centers identified under the “white zones” plan, and accede to reasonable requests for network sharing in a priority deployment zone. The Group will also have to accede to reasonable requests to allow MVNOs throughout its very-high-speed mobile network open to the public in Metropolitan France. A failure to adhere to any one of these commitments could put the Group at risk under its regulatory obligations and possibly expose it to penalties (fines, total or partial suspension or withdrawal of licence). This could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position, results of operations or outlook of the Group. To provide the Group’s various stakeholders with certainty over the future of some spectrum resources and with a view to issuing a call for applications that will enable a reallocation of longstanding 2G and 3G frequency bands for a period of 10 years (the licences relating to which will begin to expire in 2021), ARCEP has laid the ground rules for public consultation on the terms and conditions for such reallocation in its decision no. 2018-0684. The frequencies concerned are the frequencies in the 900 and 1800 MHz bands that were allocated to Orange, the Group and Bouygues Telecom in 2006 and 2009 for 15 years, and the 2.1 GHz band frequencies allocated to these same three operators in 2001 and 2002 for 20 years. Some of the existing 900, 1800 and 2100 MHz frequency licences for Metropolitan France are set to expire in 2021, 2022 and 2024. The terms for allocating frequencies seek to satisfy two main goals: digital regional development and achieving fair and effective competition between operators. The call for applications procedures for the allocation of 900, 1800 and 2100 MHz band frequencies took into account the goal of ensuring fair and effective competition in the mobile market by implementing the conditions needed to ensure that all mobile operators have fair and equal access to spectrum. It has been approved by the Minister responsible for electronic communications who launched the allocation procedure in early August 2018. The licences were awarded by ARCEP on November 15, 2018, and the frequencies will be made available starting in 2021. ----- The acquisition of licences also represents a high cost, the timing of which varies depending on when the frequencies involved are auctioned. Furthermore, this cost could rise due to strong competitive pressure in the telecommunications field. If we fail to obtain or retain, in a timely manner, the licences necessary for performing, continuing or developing our activities, the Group’s ability to achieve our strategic objectives could be subjected to alteration. In addition, the Group may fail to be awarded the desired licences, which could have an adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position, results of operations or outlook.

16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.3,Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters,1.3.6,There are uncertainties about the legal framework under which we own and operate certain of our networks.,"The Group’s systems depend on extensive physical facilities (lines, network, headends, switches and radio stations) in which telecommunication equipment (mainly cables) is installed. Significant portions of those physical facilities occupy public rights of way and are subject to governmental regulations. Other portions occupy private property under express or implied easements or pursuant to leases, and many miles of the cable are attached to utility poles governed by pole attachment agreements or other commercial arrangements. No assurances can be given that we will be able to maintain and use our facilities in their current locations and at their current costs. Changes in governmental regulations or changes in these relationships could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business and results of operations. In particular, the legal status of the Group’s network is complex, mainly governed by public and in certain cases subject to challenges or renewals. The Group’s telecommunications network is essentially composed of the physical infrastructure (conduits, network head-ends, switches and radio frequency stations) in which telecommunications (mainly cable) equipment is installed. These components of the Group’s network are subject to different legal regimes. As the Group does not own certain land where such physical infrastructures are located and infrastructure is established on public or private property, it has entered into concessions, rights-of-way, leases or even IRUs with the owners of the land. In order to establish a substantial part of its telecommunications network and of its wireless network, the Group has thus entered into public and private property occupancy agreements with public and private entities or holds public property occupancy permits. Under these agreements or permits, the Group may install its network equipment along roads, highways, railways or canals, for example. No transfer of ownership takes place within this framework. Such agreements are entered into for terms that vary greatly in duration from three to 25 years. The Group does not have any right to renewal of such agreements, although the agreements with the shortest terms generally provide for tacit renewal. The Group’s occupancy of public property, as is the case for all occupants of public property, is always precarious and subject to considerations beyond the Group’s control. The public entities with which the Group has entered into these agreements or that have issued permits to it can thus at any time terminate these public property occupancy agreements for misconduct or for reasons of public interest and some of the agreements even exclude any compensation in such case. If the Group fails to obtain such renewal, the company involved would be obliged, upon expiration of these agreements, (i) to return the site to its original condition upon the demand of the manager or owner of the public property involved and/or (ii) to transfer to the latter, in certain cases for the payment of compensation and in certain cases free of charge, ownership of the facilities established on the property involved.

16,Final Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.3,Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters,1.3.7,The Group is subject to requirements in terms of protection of personal data and data security.,"Within the context of our business activities, we must collect and process personal data. In the EU, the European Parliament and the European Council adopted the regulation on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation, the “GDPR”) on April 27, 2016. The GDPR has been directly applicable in all EU member states since May 25, 2018, replacing Directive 95/46/EC and current national data protection legislation in member states, and was implemented in the EEA countries with effect from the same date. The GDPR significantly changes the EU/EEA data protection landscape, including strengthening of individuals’ rights, stricter requirements on companies processing personal data and stricter sanctions with substantial administrative fines. The GDPR also offers data subjects the option to let a privacy organization litigate on their behalf, including collecting the potential damages. After an initial transition period, data protection authorities across the EU have now begun using their new sanctioning powers (in 2019, Google was fined ----- €50 million by the French authority (CNIL), British Airways and Marriott were provisionally fined £183 million and £99 million, respectively by the UK authority (ICO), and many cases are currently under investigation). The Group does business in the hosting of data relating to the health of individuals, which subjects us to the specific obligations provided for by the Public Health Code such as obtaining and maintaining authorization or certification for the hosting of such data. If we breach our obligations or fail to adhere to the requirements applicable to sensitive data processing, the Group may be subjected to criminal and financial penalties likely to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations. In its judgment on October 6, 2015 (known as the “Schrems Judgment”), the European Court of Justice overturned the decision by the European Commission that the transfer of European personal data to the United States under the “Safe Harbor” framework provides an adequate level of protection. The successor “Privacy Shield” agreement negotiated by representatives of the EU and the United States have been overturned by a judgment of the European Court of Justice of July 16, 2020 (case C-311/18, known as “Schrems II”) which could impact our business and results. In 2016, the CJEU further clarified what safeguards are required for data retention to be lawful. In the case of Tele2 Sverige and Home Secretary v. Watson, the court concluded that Member States cannot impose a general obligation on providers of electronic telecommunications services to retain data, but did not ban data retention altogether. Such retention is compatible with EU law if deployed against specific targets to fight serious crime. Retention measures must be necessary and proportionate regarding the categories of data to be retained, the means of communication affected, the persons concerned and the chosen duration of retention. Furthermore, national authorities’ access to the retained data must be conditional and meet certain data protection safeguards. New data retention rules are currently being discussed at an EU level in response to this decision. In the case of Breyer, the CJEU concluded that Internet Protocol addresses may constitute personal data where the individual concerned can be identified, even where a third party must obtain additional data for the identification to take place. The CJEU also held that website operators may rely on a legitimate interest as a legal basis when retaining and using their visitors’ personal data. This is of major importance for data retention rules; it follows that online media service providers can lawfully store their visitors’ personal data to pursue a legitimate interest, rather than just for the purposes previously outlined in the invalidated Data Retention Directive. Thus, the grounds justifying data retention have become broader. The French legal framework for data protection has been gradually brought in line with the GDPR and the Police and Justice Directive. The French Data Protection Law of January 6, 1978 (Law no. 78-17), was amended by Law no. 2018-493 of June 20, 2018 and its implementing decree, and by decree no. 2018-687 of August 1, 2018. Such Law was rewritten and made consistent with GDPR by Order no. 2018-1225 of December 12, 2018. Finally, a new decree implementing the Law, no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019 came into force on June 1, 2019. The French legal framework for data protection has now been stabilised. It imposes obligations on companies processing personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment in France concerning the conditions in which such a company may process personal data of individuals, the obtaining of their consent with respect to such processing (especially for the use of cookies) and carrying out the necessary measures for disclosure and transfer of data outside of the EU. Any breach of these obligations may lead to criminal and administrative financial penalties against us and damage to our reputation. On June 28, 2019, the French data protection authority (CNIL) announced new guidelines on the use of cookies for direct marketing purposes (online targeted advertisement), ruling out the use of implied or “soft” consent to place cookies on users’ devices. To assist companies in complying with these new rules, the CNIL published a draft recommendation on cookies on January 14, 2020 and the new legal regime applicable in France regarding cookies should be stabilised by the end of 2020. Regardless of the measures we adopt to protect the confidentiality, security of data and respect the rights of the people whose data we process, there remains the risk of possible attacks or breaches of data processing systems, which could give rise to penalties and damage our reputation. The Group could be compelled to incur additional costs in order to protect against these risks or to mitigate the consequences thereof, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations or outlook. Furthermore, any loss of confidence on the part of our customers as a result of such events could lead to a significant decline in sales and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations. -----",,,,N/A

However, our intellectual property rights or those of our licensors could be challenged or invalidated, we could have difficulty protecting or obtaining such rights or the rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of business opportunities, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product and service offerings or other competitive harm. The Group has received, and may receive in the future, claims of infringement or misappropriation of other parties’ proprietary rights, particularly creative rights with respect to broadcasted programs. In addition to claims relating to broadcasts on channels which the Group owns, it may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims with respect to programs broadcast on the other channels, including foreign channels that it carries. Moreover, the telecommunications industry is characterized by a high concentration of intellectual property rights, which increases the risk of litigation resulting from our activities upon the grounds of prior rights of third parties. Therefore, the Group is particularly exposed to the risk of proceedings initiated by patent trolls. See “—The Group _may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims by “patent trolls”.”_ Any such claims may require the Group to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation, regardless of the merits of these claims. Successful challenges to our rights to intellectual property or claims of infringement of a third party’s intellectual property could require the Group to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be temporarily or permanently prohibited from further use of the intellectual property in question. This could require the Group to change our business practices and limit the Group’s ability to provide our customers with the content that they expect. Even if we believe that the claims of intellectual property infringement are without merit, defending against the claims can be time consuming and costly and may divert management’s attention and resources away from our business. An inability on our part to effectively protect certain important elements of our intellectual property rights and of our technology could have a material adverse effect on our activities, financial position, results of operations or outlook.",,,,N/A

Some of the proceedings against us may involve claims for considerable amounts and may require that our general management devote time to addressing such issues, to the detriment of managing the business. In addition, such proceedings may result in substantial damages and/or may impair our reputation, which may result in a decline in the demand for our services which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The outcome of these proceedings and claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, our results of operations or our cash flows during the years when such disputes are decided or the sums potentially involved in them are paid. The Group may also be exposed to proceedings that could involve our independent distributor partners, as well as other telecommunications operators which are so exposed.

Such broad rights (such as in the GNU General Public Licence) are usually subject to the requirement that users not place any additional restrictions on access to the source code in any onward distribution of the software, and that such onward licensing be on the original licence terms. OSS is commonly viewed as having two major risks. First, the OSS licence usually also covers onward distributions of derivative works (based on the original OSS), with the result that proprietary software integrated with the OSS becomes “infected” and the entire integrated software program (OSS and proprietary software components) is covered by the OSS licence. One notable result of this is that the publisher or distributor of the derivative work would have to make available the source code of the entire work, including the proprietary software portions. The second commonly viewed risk is that OSS software is usually licenced “as is” without any contractual warranties. As a result, the Group would bear the risks in the event of defects with any OSS that the Group utilizes in its products and services without necessarily having any contractual recourse. Further, if the Group integrates OSS into any of the software that it publishes or distributes, then the use by the Group of OSS could have an impact on the ownership of the intellectual property in such software, particularly in terms of exclusivity, as the refusal to disclose any modifications made could be characterized as an infringement of the OSS licence. Moreover, the Group cannot rule out any risk of a request for disclosure or the request by a third party to access the modifications of the source code performed on such software.

As a result, the Group may face increases in taxes payable if tax rates increase, or if tax laws and regulations are modified by the competent authorities in an adverse manner. In addition, the tax authorities in France periodically examine our activities. Any change in local or international tax rules, for example prompted by the implementation of the OECD’s recommendations on Base Erosion and Profits Shifting (a global initiative to improve the fairness and integrity of tax systems), or new challenges by tax authorities, may have an adverse effect on the Group’s tax positions and its financial results. Any changes may also affect the return on an investors’ investment in the Group and result in changes in personal tax rates and tax relief. The Group has structured its commercial and financial activities in compliance with various regulatory obligations to which it is subject, as well as in line with our commercial and financial objectives. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax positions, including, amongst others, corporate income tax and value added tax (“VAT”). In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. To the extent that the laws and regulations of the various countries in which our companies are located or operate do not establish clear or definitive provisions, the tax treatment applied to our activities or our intra ----- group reorganizations is sometimes based on interpretations of the applicable tax regulations. The Group cannot guarantee that such interpretations will not be called into question by the competent tax administrations, which could have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of our operations More generally, any breach of the tax regulations and laws of the countries in which our companies are located or operate could result in adjustments or the payment of late fees, fines or penalties. The French tax authorities have reassessed the application of VAT rates on certain multi-play offerings for fiscal years 2011 to 2016. The Group is disputing all of the proposed reassessments and has initiated appeals and dispute proceedings, which are at different stages for each of the years subject to reassessments. For more details, see “Business of the Group—Legal Proceedings— _Tax Audits”._ In addition, tax laws and regulations could change and could be subject to changes in their interpretation and in the application thereof. In particular, in the current macroeconomic environment, governmental authorities could decide to increase tax rates, to eliminate existing tax exemptions, to expand tax bases, or to introduce new taxes. As a result, we could undergo an increase in our tax burden if tax rates rise or if legislation or the interpretation thereof by the administration changes. In particular, the Group is exposed to the risk of a further increase in the VAT (and / or sectorial taxes such as turnover taxes on electronic communications operators) and might not be able to pass along such increase, in full or in part, through subscription prices, and this would then have a negative impact on overall revenue.

In this respect, French case law has developed the concept of “abnormal act of management”, according to which the expenses incurred by a French company in relation with transactions that are not aligned with its direct corporate interest are not tax deductible. Given the complex intragroup transactions within the Group, the risk that the French Tax Authorities might try to challenge the deductibility of interest expenses resulting from intragroup financings (e.g., interest expenses on an intragroup loan), considering that such transactions (i) are not performed in the direct corporate interest of the French company of the Group at the level of which these interest expenses are incurred or (ii) have not been set at arm’s length conditions, cannot be excluded. Under Article 39.1.3° of the FTC, the deduction of interest paid by a French company to lenders who are direct shareholders of such company but are not related parties to such company within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC, is subject to the conditions that (i) the share capital of the borrowing company is fully paid-in and (ii) the interest rate on the corresponding loans does not exceed a rate equal to the annual average rate of floating rate loans granted by financial establishments for a minimum term of two years (1.32% with respect to fiscal years closed on December 31, 2019). By exception, pursuant to Article 212, I-(a) of the FTC, the deductibility of interest ----- paid on loans granted by a related party within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC is deductible within the limit of the interest that would have resulted from the application of the maximum tax rate computed as per Article 39, 1-3° of the FTC, or, if higher, from the rate that the borrower could have obtained from independent financial establishments in similar conditions. Pursuant to Article 39.12 of the FTC, two entities will be regarded as related if (i) one of the entities holds directly or indirectly the majority of the other entity’s share capital or actually exercises the power of decision in that entity or (ii) both entities are placed under the conditions defined in (i) to the control of a same third entity. In both of the above mentioned cases of interest and deductibility limitation, non-deductible expenses might be recharacterized as constructive dividends pursuant to Article 109 et seq. of the FTC, which may be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis, 2 of the FTC, at a rate of (i) 28% (such rate will be lowered to 26,5% for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2021 and to 25% for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2022 in order to be aligned on the French standard corporate income tax rate) for payments benefiting legal persons who are not French tax residents or (ii) 75% for payments made in non-cooperative jurisdictions within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the FTC other than those mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of the same Article 238-0 A, subject in any case to the more favorable provisions of an applicable double tax treaty. The French Finance Law for 2020 introduced new Articles 205 B, 205 C and 205 D in the FTC in order to implement under French tax law the provisions of the Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 of May 29, 2017 (the “ATAD 2”) on hybrid mismatches. These new rules aim at challenging hybrid and residency mismatches (the “Hybrid Mismatch Rules”) and replace the former anti-hybrid limitation that was set out by Article 212 I, b) of the FTC (pursuant to which the deductibility of interest paid on loans granted by a related party – within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC – was subject to the requirement that the lender was, for the current year and with respect to concerned interest, subject to an income tax in an amount which was at least equal to 25% of the corporate income tax determined under standard French tax rules). Most of the Hybrid Mismatch Rules apply as from fiscal years starting on or after January 1, 2020 (consequently, Article 212 I-b of the FTC has been repealed from January 1, 2020). In substance, hybrid mismatches may result from the difference in the CIT tax treatment of (i) financial instruments, (ii) entities or (iii) payment attribution rules between two countries. Such differences may result in either: i A deduction for tax purposes in one country (the payer’s jurisdiction) without corresponding inclusion in the other (the payee’s jurisdiction); or ii A deduction in both countries (i.e., in the jurisdiction in which the payment has its source and in the investor’s jurisdiction). The new Hybrid Mismatch Rules provide for neutralization mechanisms of these mismatches which broadly lead to either (i) a non-deduction of payments or (ii) an inclusion in the taxable income of these payments. In practice, the Hybrid Mismatch Rules may concern any type of expenditure (including financial expenses) but shall only apply if a mismatch outcome arises either (i) between associated enterprises or (ii) under a structured arrangement (i.e., an arrangement involving a hybrid mismatch where the mismatch outcome is priced into the terms of the arrangement or an arrangement that has been designed to produce a hybrid mismatch outcome). For the purposes of these rules, an associated enterprise is different from a related party within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC and means: - an entity in which the taxpayer (i) holds directly or indirectly a participation in terms of voting rights or capital ownership of 50% or more or (ii) is entitled to receive 50% or more of the profits of that entity; - a person which (i) holds directly or indirectly a participation in terms of voting rights or capital ownership in a taxpayer of 50% or more or (ii) is entitled to receive 50% or more of the profits of the taxpayer; - a taxpayer in which a person, who holds directly or indirectly a participation of 50% or more of the taxpayer’s voting rights or capital, also holds an interest of 50% or more of the voting rights or capital; ----- - an entity that is part of the same consolidated group for financial accounting purposes as the taxpayer; An enterprise in which the taxpayer has a significant influence in the management or an enterprise that has a significant influence in the management of the taxpayer. Pursuant to Article 212 bis of the FTC, subject to certain exceptions and safeharbour clauses, net financial charges, which are defined as the portion of financial charges exceeding financial income, accrued by companies that are subject to French corporate income tax, without distinction between third-party debts and related-party debts are deductible from their taxable result only up to a maximum amount equal to the higher of: (i) €3 million (to be adjusted on a _prorata temporis basis for fiscal years which do no last twelve months) and (ii) 30% of the company’s result before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization adjusted for tax purposes (“Tax EBITDA”) generated in the same fiscal year (the “30% EBITDA Limitation”). By exception, subject to certain exceptions and safeharbour clauses, where the average amount of the relatedparty debts of a company within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC during a fiscal year exceeds in respect of that fiscal year one and a half times the amount of its equity (fonds propres), net financial expenses borne by such company are deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 30% of its Tax EBITDA and (ii) €3 million multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of non-related party debts increased by 1.5x the company’s equity (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) divided by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said year. The balance of net financial expenses is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the highest of (i) 10% of its Tax EBITDA and (ii) €1 million multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of related-party debt exceeding 1.5x the company’s equity (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) divided by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said fiscal year Under Article 223 B bis of the FTC, the above mentioned limitations apply, mutatis mutandis, to companies that belong to French tax-consolidated groups with respect to amounts made available by lenders outside such group. Finally, pursuant to Article 223 B of the FTC (generally referred to as the “Amendement Charasse”), when the shares of a target company are purchased from a seller by a company controlled directly or indirectly by such seller (or placed under common control with the seller), and the target company and the acquiring company become members of the same French tax-consolidated group, a portion of the interest incurred by the French taxconsolidated group in respect of a fiscal year is considered as non-deductible and is therefore added back to the tax-consolidated income. This add-back of financial costs is applicable over a maximum period of nine fiscal years (including the acquisition’s fiscal year) unless the target company leaves the French tax consolidated group (other than as a result of a merger with a company of the tax group to which the acquiring company belongs). If the limitation applies, the amount to be added back for each fiscal year is computed as follows: Purchase price of the shares Non-deductible interest Interest expenses deducted from the tax = x expenses group’s taxable income Average amount of the tax group’s debts The above mentioned tax rules may limit the Group’s ability to deduct interest accrued on the Group’s indebtedness incurred in France and, as a consequence, may increase the Group’s tax burden, which could adversely affect the Group’s business, results of operations and financial condition and reduce the cash flow available to service the Group’s indebtedness.",,,,N/A

This leads to regular changes in the Group’s organizational structure and operations, which requires the Group’s employees to be flexible in responding to such changes. This process requires mobilization and motivation of teams with the Group’s objectives. As a result, the Group’s business could be affected by deterioration in labor relations with its employees, staff representative bodies or unions. The Group’s ability to maintain good relations with our employees, staff representative bodies and unions is crucial to the success of our various projects. Therefore, we must continuously consult with staff representatives in order to ensure the success of our current and future projects, which may delay the completion of certain projects. Furthermore, projects may be poorly received by employees and lead to a deterioration in labor relations, which could, in turn, lead to declines in productivity and possible labor disputes (e.g., strikes, disruptions), which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, planned decisions may not be well received by employees and may lead to a deterioration of the social climate, causing decreases in productivity and potential social conflicts (work interruptions, disruptions, etc.).

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, Next Alt is the controlling ----- shareholder of Altice Europe, and Altice Europe (through its indirect subsidiaries) owns 100% share capital and voting rights in the Issuer. In the event of consummation of the Take-Private Transaction, Next Alt will be the sole shareholder of Altice Europe and consequently Altice Europe would no longer have public investors as minority shareholders. When business opportunities, or risks and risk allocation arise, the interests of Altice Europe (or its affiliates) or Next Alt may be different from, or in conflict with, the Group’s interests on a standalone basis. Altice Europe and Next Alt may allocate certain of their risks to the Issuer or the Group and the Issuer cannot assure you that Altice Europe or Next Alt will permit the Group to pursue certain business opportunities.

A change of strategy or management adversely affecting the Group’s operations could indirectly have an adverse effect on the Issuer’s abilities to meet its obligations under the Notes. In addition, Altice Europe or Next Alt has, directly or indirectly, the power to control the Group’s ability to enter into any corporate transaction and prevent any transaction that requires the approval of shareholders, regardless of whether holders of the Notes believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests. For example, Altice Europe or Next Alt could exercise such power to cause us to incur additional indebtedness or sell certain material assets, in each case, so long as the Group’s debt instruments and the Intercreditor Agreement permit. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase the Group’s debt service obligations and the sale of certain assets could reduce the Group’s ability to generate revenues, each of which could adversely affect the holders of the Notes.

The Group may have to negotiate at length with unions and works councils, and may suffer strikes, labor conflicts, work stoppages and other labor action, and it may also encounter difficulties in attracting and keeping staff due to local or general strikes. Strikes and other labor action, as well as the negotiating of new collective bargaining agreements or wage negotiations, could disrupt our activities and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. The Group is active in very competitive markets that are constantly evolving, thus requiring its constant adaptation to, anticipation and adoption of new operational practices and technologies to preserve its competitiveness and our efficiency. This entails regular changes in organizations, which requires adaptation on the part of the human resources involved. In particular, this process demands an ability to mobilize skills and motivate and orient teams toward our objectives. As a result, the Group’s activities may sometimes be affected by a deterioration of the labor relations with our employees, staff representative bodies or labor unions. In such instances, certain of the Group’s entities would have to consult their staff representative bodies, or will have to do so, in order to successfully execute the Group’s current and future projects, which is likely to slow down the performance of certain operations.

The only significant assets of the Issuer on the Issue Date will consist of cash in its bank accounts and its shares in its direct subsidiaries and various intercompany loans to its subsidiaries. As such, the Issuer will be wholly dependent upon payments under such loans and other payments from members of the Group in order to service its debt obligations under the Notes to the extent it does not have cash to meet those obligations. The ability of members of the Group to make such payments will depend upon their cash flows and earnings which, in turn, will be affected by all of the factors discussed in these “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Furthermore, the payment of dividends and the making, or repayment, of loans and advances to the Issuer by the Issuer’s subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions. The ability of any of the Issuer’s direct or indirect subsidiaries to make certain distributions may be limited by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the subsidiaries are organized or located, including financial assistance rules, corporate benefit laws, requirements that dividends must be paid out of reserves available for distribution and other legal restrictions which, if violated, might require the recipient to refund unlawful payments. In some cases, receipt of such payments or advances may be subject to onerous tax consequences. Although the Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Indentures, the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and the Existing Term Loans Agreement limit the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to enter into future consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends and make other payments to the Issuer or the Guarantors, there are significant qualifications and exceptions to these limitations.

The value of the Notes Collateral and the amount that may be received upon a sale of Notes Collateral will depend upon many factors including, among others, the condition of the Notes Collateral, the ability to sell the Notes ----- Collateral in an orderly sale, industry, market and economic conditions, whether the business is sold as a going concern, the availability of buyers and other factors. With respect to any shares of the Group’s subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, such shares may also have limited value in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, winding up or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, courts could limit recoverability with respect to the Notes Collateral if they deem a portion of the interest claim usurious in violation of applicable public policy. As a result, liquidating the Notes Collateral may not produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due on the Notes. If the proceeds of Notes Collateral were not sufficient to repay amounts outstanding under the Notes, then holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Notes Collateral) would only have an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s and Guarantors’ remaining assets. See “—It may be difficult to realize the value of the Notes Collateral securing the Notes.” No appraisal of the fair market value of the Notes Collateral has been made in connection with this offering of Notes. The book value of the Notes Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. The value of the Notes Collateral could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic and market conditions, the Group’s failure to successfully implement the Group’s business strategy, competition and other factors. The Notes Collateral may include intangible or other illiquid assets that by their nature may not have a readily ascertainable market value, whose value to other parties may be less than its value to the Group, or may not be readily saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in their liquidation. In addition, the value of the Notes Collateral may decrease because of obsolescence, impairment or certain casualty events. The Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Indentures, the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and the Existing Term Loans Agreement permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes on the Notes Collateral securing the Notes. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy such liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Indentures, the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and the Existing Term Loans Agreement or the Notes Collateral Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Notes Collateral that, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Notes Guarantees, to the extent such Notes and Notes Guarantees are secured by such Notes Collateral. Moreover, if the Issuer issues additional Notes under the Indenture, holders of such additional Notes would benefit from the same Notes Collateral as the holders of the Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting holders of Notes’ ability to benefit from the liens on the Notes Collateral securing their Notes. The Intercreditor Agreement provides for detailed enforcement mechanisms with respect to the Notes Collateral and any enforcement of the Notes Collateral will be subject in many cases to significant limitations under local law.

The Initial Purchasers have neither analyzed the effect of, nor participated in any negotiations relating to, such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens, loss of legal perfection and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Notes Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Notes Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests over real or personal property such as the Notes Collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party, including that of competent regulatory authorities or courts, to enforce a security interest. The Group cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. The Group also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Notes Collateral may significantly decrease. ----- Furthermore, enforcement procedures and timing for obtaining judicial decisions in Luxembourg may be materially more complex and time consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which investors may be more familiar. In addition, the Group’s business requires a variety of national and local permits and licenses. The continued operation of properties that comprise part of the Notes Collateral and that depend on the maintenance of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or restricted. The Group’s business is subject to regulations and permitting requirements and may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with existing regulations or requirements or if changes in applicable regulations or requirements occur. In the event of foreclosure, the grant of permits and licenses may be revoked and the transfer of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or may require us to incur significant cost and expense. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that the applicable governmental authorities will consent to the transfer of all such permits. If the regulatory approvals required for such transfers are not obtained, are delayed or are economically prevented, the foreclosure may be delayed, a temporary or lasting shutdown of operations may result, and the value of the Notes Collateral may be significantly decreased.",,,,N/A

The liens on the Notes Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, as the case may be, if the Security Agent is not able to or does not take the actions necessary to perfect or maintain the perfection of any such liens. Such failure may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest in the Notes Collateral securing the Notes or the Notes Guarantees, as applicable, or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of such debt against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Notes Collateral. In addition, applicable law may require that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. There can be no assurance that the Security Agent will monitor, or that we will inform the Security Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Notes Collateral, and that all necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after acquired collateral. Neither the Security Agent nor the Trustee has any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that should constitute Notes Collateral or the perfection of, or to take steps to perfect, any security interest therein. Such failure may result in the loss of the security interest in the Notes Collateral or adversely affect the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes and the Notes Guarantees against third parties including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who may claim a secured interest in any part of the Notes Collateral. Additionally, the Indenture and the Notes Collateral Documents may require the Group to take a number of actions that might improve the perfection or priority of the liens of the Security Agent in the Notes Collateral.

As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Notes, except through the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Notes Collateral. The ability of the Trustee to control enforcement of any such collateral is subject to significant limitations. See “Description of Other _Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”._ ----- The appointment of a foreign security agent will be recognized under Luxembourg law, (i) to the extent that the designation is valid under the law governing such appointment and (ii) subject to possible restrictions, depending on the type of the security interests. Generally, according to article 2(4) of the Luxembourg Act dated August 5, 2005 concerning financial collateral arrangements, as amended, a security (financial collateral) may be provided in favor of a person acting on behalf of the collateral taker, a fiduciary or a trustee in order to secure the claims of third party beneficiaries, whether present or future, provided that these third party beneficiaries are determined or may be determined. Without prejudice to their obligations vis à vis third party beneficiaries of the security, persons acting on behalf of beneficiaries of the security, the fiduciary or the trustee benefit from the same rights as those of the direct beneficiaries of the security aimed at by such law. The respective security documents governing the Notes Collateral will be governed by the laws of a number of jurisdictions. Bankruptcy laws could prevent the Security Agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes from repossessing and disposing of the Notes Collateral upon the occurrence of an event of default if a bankruptcy proceeding is commenced by or against the relevant grantor, before the Security Agent repossesses and disposes of such Notes Collateral to the extent applicable.

The granting of shared security interests to secure future permitted debt may restart or reopen such hardening or voidance periods in particular, because the Indenture will permit the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future debt. The applicable hardening or voidance period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected.

The Notes will be guaranteed as from the Issue Date by the Guarantors, which are incorporated under the laws of France, Luxembourg and the United States. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any, all or any combination of the above jurisdictions. Such jurisdictions may not be as favorable to investors as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar, and proceedings in these jurisdictions are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. Your rights under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Notes Collateral will be subject to such bankruptcy, insolvency and administrative laws and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. See “—Each Notes Guarantee will be subject to certain limitations _on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability”._ In particular, French bankruptcy laws and regulations are unfavorable to creditors in many respects. Applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in France could limit the enforceability of the Notes, of the Notes Guarantees or of the security interests over the Notes Collateral. The insolvency court may also in certain circumstances void the security interests if insolvency proceedings have been commenced against a company incorporated in France. For a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency laws in France, see “Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes _Guarantees and the Security Interests and Insolvency Laws of Certain Jurisdictions—France—French insolvency laws”._ In addition, in the event that the Issuer, the Guarantors and any future guarantor, if any, or any of the Group’s other subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of ----- the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ jurisdictions of organization and location of assets may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other and those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether the law of any particular jurisdiction should apply, and may adversely affect the ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Notes Collateral in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

However, the Indenture will provide that such Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that may be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without, among other things, rendering the relevant Notes Guarantee, as it relates to that Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law or causing the officers of the Guarantors to incur personal civil or criminal liability, and enforcement of each such Notes Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses. See “Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of the _Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and Insolvency Laws of Certain Jurisdictions”._ Enforcement of any of the Notes Guarantees against any Guarantor, or of the security interests in respect thereof will be subject to certain defenses available to Guarantors (including the Issuer) in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a court could (i) void or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Notes Guarantee or the security interests in respect thereof, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Notes Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that: - the relevant Notes Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the relevant Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the Notes Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware that the relevant Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Notes Guarantee; - the relevant Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for the relevant Notes Guarantee and such Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Notes Guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Notes Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; - the relevant Notes Guarantee was held to exceed or breach financial assistance rules or the corporate objects of the Guarantors or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantors; or - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Notes Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of the Group’s subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes Guarantee against the Guarantor. We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Notes Guarantee was issued, that payments for the benefit of holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: ----- - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than the fair value of all its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become due; or - it cannot pay with its available assets its debts as they become due. The liability of each Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee will be contractually limited to the amount that will result in such Notes Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire Notes Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. If a court decided that a Notes Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and voided such Notes Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you or the Security Agent for your benefit may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Notes Guarantee that has not been declared void. In the event that any Notes Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Guarantee obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if the Issuer cannot satisfy its obligations under the Notes or any Notes Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, you may not be repaid in full amounts outstanding under the Notes.

If a change of control triggering event were to occur, there can be no assurances that the Issuer would have sufficient funds available at such time to pay such purchase price or that the restrictions in agreements and instruments governing the Group’s debt would allow such Issuer to make such required repurchases. Additionally, under the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities a change of control triggering event (as defined therein) constitutes a mandatory prepayment event and an automatic cancellation of the facilities thereunder and under the Existing Term Loans a change of control triggering event (as defined therein) constitutes an event of default permitting the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings under the Existing Term Loans Agreement and the commitments thereunder to lend would terminate. The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders of the Notes, and its other indebtedness following the occurrence of a change of control triggering event may be limited by the Group’s then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. Furthermore, the Issuer’s ability to repurchase the Notes may be limited by law. If an event constituting a change of control triggering event occurs at a time when any of the Issuer is prohibited from repurchasing the Notes, under the agreements and instruments governing the Group’s debt, the Issuer may be required to seek the consent of the creditors under such indebtedness to purchase the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If we do not obtain such consent or refinance such borrowings, we will remain prohibited from any such repurchases. In addition, we expect that we would require third party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control triggering event, as set forth in the Indenture. The Group cannot assure you that it would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which could, in turn, constitute a default under other agreements governing the Group’s debt. See “Description of Notes—Change of Control”. The change of control triggering event provisions contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers, recapitalizations or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “change of control triggering event” as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of _Notes—Change of Control”, the Indenture will not contain provisions requiring the Group to offer to make_ ----- repurchases or redemptions, in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. The definition of “change of control” to be contained in the Indenture includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer, and its restricted subsidiaries taken as whole to any person other than certain permitted holders. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. In addition, holders of the Notes may not be entitled to require the Issuer to purchase its Notes in certain circumstances involving a significant change in the composition of Altice Europe’s board of directors, including in connection with a proxy contest, where Altice Europe’s board of directors initially publicly opposes the election of a dissident slate of directors, but subsequently approves such directors for the purposes of the Indenture. This may result in a change in the composition of the board of directors that, but for such subsequent approval, would have otherwise constituted a change of control requiring a repurchase offer under the terms of the Indenture. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase its Notes.",,,,N/A

The overall impact on our business, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition could be material.","In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease was reported and in January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. On February 28, 2020, the WHO raised its assessment of the COVID-19 threat from high to very high at a global level due to the continued increase in the number of cases and affected countries, and on March 11, 2020, the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected global economies, financial markets and the overall environment in which we do business, and the extent to which it may impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain. For a discussion of the impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on our business, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Quarterly Reports, which are incorporated by reference herein. In addition, the scale and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic may heighten the potential adverse effects on our business, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition described in the risk factors contained in our Annual Report, including the impact of: - Significant interruptions in the operations of our manufacturing or distribution centers and logistics providers for the reasons described below; - Global and regional economic and political conditions on our production, supply chain, the overall demand for our products and the ability of our customers to purchase and/or pay for our products as a result of the pandemic’s impact on them; Our ability to develop and produce new products and services in an effort to address medical and other requirements as a result of the pandemic; - Changes in laws, regulations and regulatory requirements; - Limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies with third parties or partners outside the United States; - The risk of regulatory enforcement actions, product defects or claims thereof; - Our ability to pursue our growth strategies; - Our ability to pursue strategic acquisitions; - Changes within the industries that we serve; ----- - Our ability to access raw materials for use in the products we manufacture; and - The potential loss of customers or a reduction in orders from a significant number of customers. In addition, COVID-19 is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, certain elements of our business (including certain elements of our operations, supply chains and distribution systems) as a result of impacts associated with preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses, our communities and governments are taking. In an effort to halt the outbreak of COVID-19, countries throughout the world, including the United States, most European Union member states, the United Kingdom, India and China, have placed significant restrictions on travel and many businesses have announced extended closures. These restrictions extend to a number of locations where we have significant operations and include shelter in place or stay-at-home orders that require our employees in that area to work from home and avoid unnecessary travel. In addition to existing travel restrictions, jurisdictions may continue to close borders, impose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel and business activity, which could significantly impact our ability to support our operations and customers, the ability of our employees to get to their workplaces to produce products and provide services and the availability of raw materials for production of our products, as well as significantly hamper our products from moving through the supply chain. Further, in connection with the global outbreak and spread of COVID-19 and in an effort to increase the wider availability of needed medical and other supplies and products, we may elect to, or governments may require us to, allocate our products (for example pursuant to the U.S. Defense Production Act) in a way that adversely affects our regular operations and financial results, results in differential treatment of customers and/or adversely affects our reputation and customer relationships. In addition, unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products could exceed our capacity to meet such demand, which could adversely affect our financial results and customer relationships and result in negative publicity. The duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, suppliers and partners. Such impact on our business, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition could be material.",,,,N/A
25_1,Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes,1.1.2,"The Issuer has a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect the Issuer’s financial condition, and prevent the Issuer from fulfilling its obligations under the notes. In addition, the value of the rights of holders of the notes to the Collateral (as defined herein) may be reduced by any increase in the indebtedness secured by the Collateral.","After completion of this offering, the Issuer will have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which requires us to make significant interest and principal payments. On an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to the Refinancing Transactions, the Issuer and the Issuer’s subsidiaries would have had approximately $5,108.4 million of indebtedness as of September 30, 2020, including the notes offered hereby, and estimated cash interest for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 would have been approximately $182.4 million. On an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to the Refinancing Transactions, the Issuer would also have had an additional $515.0 million available for borrowing under the Revolver (excluding issued but undrawn letters of credit) and an additional $260.0 million would have been available for borrowing under the A/R Facility. The Issuer’s substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to us and to the holders of the notes, including the following: - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes and or other debt; - exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, are at variable rates of interest, which could further adversely impact our cash flows; ----- - restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures; - requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, future business opportunities and the industry in which we operate; - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our less leveraged competitors; - increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business and both general and industry-specific adverse economic conditions; and - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing at a favorable cost of borrowing, or at all, or to dispose of assets to raise funds, to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements. The Issuer and the Issuer’s subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the indenture that governs the Existing Unsecured Notes and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby. To the extent the Issuer and the Issuer’s subsidiaries incur further indebtedness, the substantial risks related to the Issuer’s level of indebtedness would increase. If the Issuer incurs any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the notes, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably with such holders in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of the company, subject to any collateral arrangements. This may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to you. To the extent the Issuer and the Issuer’s subsidiaries incur further indebtedness, the substantial risks related to the Issuer’s level of indebtedness would increase. See “Description of Notes.” The Issuer’s ability to meet expenses, to remain in compliance with its covenants under such debt instruments and to make future principal and interest payments in respect of the Issuer’s debt depends on, among other things, the Issuer’s operating performance, competitive developments and financial market conditions, all of which are significantly affected by financial, business, economic and other factors. The Issuer is not able to control many of these factors. Given current industry and economic conditions, the Issuer’s cash flow may not be sufficient to allow the Issuer to pay principal and interest on its debt, including the notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and the Existing Unsecured Notes, and meet its other obligations.",,,,N/A
25_1,Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes,1.1.3,"Due to many factors beyond the Issuer’s control, including as a result of the impact of COVID-19, the Issuer may not have sufficient cash flows from operating activities to service all of the Issuer’s indebtedness, including the notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing Unsecured Notes, and meet the Issuer’s other ongoing liquidity needs, and it may be forced to take other actions to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations under its debt agreements, which may not be successful.","The Issuer’s ability to make payments on and to refinance its indebtedness, including the notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing Unsecured Notes, will depend on its ability to generate cash in the future. The Issuer’s ability to generate cash will be subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond the Issuer’s control, such as the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Issuer’s future cash flow, cash on hand or available borrowings may not be sufficient to meet such obligations and commitments. If the Issuer is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its indebtedness and to meet its other commitments, the Issuer will be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as refinancing or restructuring the Issuer’s indebtedness (including the notes), selling material assets or operations or seeking to raise additional debt or equity capital. These actions may not be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms or at all, or these actions may not enable us to continue to satisfy the Issuer’s capital requirements. In addition, the Issuer’s existing or future debt agreements contain and will contain restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. The Issuer’s failure to comply ----- with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all its debts. See “Description of Notes.” In addition, the Issuer conducts substantially all of its operations through its subsidiaries, certain of which will not be issuers or guarantors of the notes or its other indebtedness. Accordingly, repayment of such indebtedness, including the notes, will be dependent in part on the generation of cash flow by its subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of the notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Existing Unsecured Notes or such other indebtedness, the subsidiaries will not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Existing Unsecured Notes or such other indebtedness, as applicable, or to make funds available for that purpose. The Issuer’s subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of the Issuer’s indebtedness, including the notes. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit the Issuer’s ability to obtain cash from the Issuer’s subsidiaries. While the indenture that governs the Existing Unsecured Notes, the credit agreement that governs the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the agreements governing certain of our other indebtedness limit, and the indenture that will govern the notes will limit, the ability of certain of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to the Issuer, these limitations are, in the case of our existing debt, and will be, in the case of the notes offered hereby, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In the event that the Issuer does not receive distributions from its subsidiaries, the Issuer may be unable to make the required principal and interest payments on the Issuer’s indebtedness, including the notes. If the Issuer cannot make scheduled payments on its debt, the Issuer will be in default, and as a result, holders of the notes and certain of its other indebtedness could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities could foreclose against the assets securing the borrowings under such agreements and the Issuer could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, which, in each case, could result in your losing all or a portion of your investment in the notes.",,,,N/A
25_1,Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes,1.1.4,A significant portion of our net sales and assets are derived from entities that will not be guarantors of the notes. The notes and the guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of the Issuer’s non-guarantor subsidiaries.,"From and after the consummation of this offering, the notes offered hereby will be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Holdings and all of Holdings’ existing and future domestic subsidiaries to the extent each such subsidiary guarantees the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. However, the guarantee of the notes by a subsidiary will be automatically released under certain circumstances. See “Description of Notes—Guarantees.” In addition, the indenture that governs the Existing Unsecured Notes permits, and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will permit, the Issuer’s subsidiaries, including the Issuer’s non-guarantor subsidiaries, to incur certain additional indebtedness, and will not limit their ability to incur trade payables and similar liabilities that are not considered indebtedness thereunder. You will not have any claim as a creditor against any of the Issuer’s non-guarantor subsidiaries. Furthermore, in the event that any non-guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent or is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved, the assets of such non-guarantor subsidiary will be used first to satisfy the claims of its creditors, including trade creditors, banks and other lenders, followed by claims of any holders of preferred stock of such nonguarantor subsidiary. Only the residual equity value will be available to us and the Issuer’s guarantors, and only to the extent the Issuer or any guarantor is a parent company of such non-guarantor subsidiary. Consequently, each guarantee of the notes will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of non-guarantor subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution of any non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their debt, including their trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding indebtedness or guarantees issued by those subsidiaries, are generally entitled to payment on their claims from assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to us. Excluding the effect of intercompany balances as well as intercompany transactions, after giving effect to the Refinancing Transactions, the non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer accounted for approximately $2,719.6 ----- million, or 44%, of its net sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, and approximately $5,691.7 million, or 57%, of its total assets as of September 30, 2020, and would have accounted for approximately $57.4 million, or 1.1%, of its total gross indebtedness including capital lease obligations as of September 30, 2020.",,,,N/A
25_1,Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes,1.1.5,"There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the notes under which the guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the trustee.","Under various circumstances, the guarantees of the notes will be released automatically. The guarantee of a guarantor of the notes will be automatically released to the extent such guarantor is released in connection with a sale or other disposition of the equity interests of such guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the indenture that will govern the notes. The indenture also will permit us to designate one or more of the Issuer’s restricted subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the notes as an unrestricted subsidiary, which will result in the guarantee of such guarantor being automatically released. If a guarantor is released from its guarantee of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and certain other indebtedness of the Issuer or any other guarantor, other than in connection with a refinancing of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and such other indebtedness or a payment under such guarantee, or a guarantor ceases to be a subsidiary as a result of any foreclosure of any pledge or security interest securing the secured indebtedness, such subsidiary’s guarantee of the notes will be automatically released as well, in which case any liens on the assets of such subsidiary in favor of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the notes offered hereby will also be released. If the guarantee of any guarantor is released, no holder of the notes will have a claim as a creditor against that subsidiary, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables and preferred stock, if any, whether secured or unsecured, of that subsidiary will be structurally senior to the claim of any holders of the notes. For a description of all circumstances in which a guarantor’s subsidiary guarantee will be automatically released, see “Description of Notes—Guarantees.”",,,,N/A

See “Description of Notes—Release of Collateral”; - with respect to Collateral held by a guarantor of the notes, upon the release of such guarantor from its guarantees; and - if the Issuer or the notes are rated investment grade by any two of the three rating agencies. See “Description of Notes—Covenant Suspension.” The indenture that will govern the notes will also permit us to designate one or more of the Issuer’s restricted subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the notes as an unrestricted subsidiary. If the Issuer designates a subsidiary guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the indenture that will govern the notes, all of the liens on any Collateral owned by that subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries and any guarantees of the notes by that subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries will be released under the indenture that will govern the notes. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary will reduce the aggregate value of the Collateral securing the notes to the extent that liens on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries are released. In addition, the creditors of any such unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have a claim on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries senior to the claim of the holders of the notes.",,,,N/A

Any pledge of collateral in favor of the collateral agent for the notes and the other security documents delivered after the Reversion Date, could be avoidable in bankruptcy and if this were to occur, you could lose the benefit of such security interest.

See “Description of Notes—Guarantees.” The lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will have the discretion to release the guarantees under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities in a variety of circumstances. You will not have a claim as a creditor against any entity that is no longer a guarantor of the notes, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those non-guarantor subsidiaries will effectively be senior to claims of noteholders.",,,,N/A

The agreements governing the Issuer’s indebtedness restrict or will restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer’s ability and the ability of the Issuer’s restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: - incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; - pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, capital stock; - prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt; - make loans and investments; - sell or otherwise dispose of assets; - sell stock of the Issuer’s subsidiaries; - create or incur liens; - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; - enter into agreements restricting the Issuer’s and the Issuer’s subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or to incur liens on assets; ----- - enter into amendments to certain subordinated indebtedness in a manner materially adverse to the lenders; and - consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of the Issuer’s assets. In addition, any future financing arrangements entered into by us may contain similar restrictions. As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the Issuer is and will be limited in how the Issuer conducts its business, and the Issuer may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. In addition, the Issuer will be required to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. The terms of any future indebtedness the Issuer may incur could include more restrictive covenants. The Issuer cannot assure you that it will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if the Issuer fails to do so, that the Issuer will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants. Events beyond our control, including the impact of COVID-19, may affect our ability to comply with our covenants. The Issuer’s failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as others contained in the Issuer’s future debt instruments from time to time could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the Issuer being required to repay these borrowings before their maturity. If the Issuer is forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these borrowings, the Issuer’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.",,,,N/A
25_1,Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes,1.1.10,"Federal and state statutes may allow courts, under specific circumstances, to avoid the notes, the guarantees relating to the notes, and the liens securing the notes and related guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes, the guarantees and the liens securing the notes and related guarantees and/or require holders of the notes to return payments received from us in respect of the guarantees and the liens.","The incurrence of indebtedness evidenced by the notes, the guarantees and the grant of liens by the guarantors (including any future guarantees and future liens) may be subject to review and challenge under relevant state and federal fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer statutes in a bankruptcy or reorganization case or a lawsuit by or on behalf of the Issuer’s creditors outside of bankruptcy. Under these statutes, the notes, the guarantees and the grant of liens, could be avoided, or claims in respect of the notes, the guarantees and the liens could be subordinated to all of the Issuer’s other indebtedness, if a court were to find at the time the Issuer or such guarantor issued the notes, incurred a guarantee of the notes or granted the lien, as applicable, that the Issuer or the applicable guarantor received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for issuing the note, incurring the guarantee or granting the lien, and: - intended to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditor; - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the incurrence of such indebtedness; - was engaged in, or about to engage in, a business or transaction for which the Issuer’s or the guarantor’s remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or - intended to incur, or believed that the Issuer or guarantor would incur, indebtedness beyond the Issuer’s or such guarantor’s ability to repay such debts as they mature. A court might also avoid the issuance of the notes, a guarantee or a lien, without regard to the above factors, if the court found that the Issuer issued the notes or the guarantors entered into the applicable guarantee or granted the liens with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud the Issuer’s or the guarantors’ respective creditors. If a court were to avoid (x) the issuance of the notes or the guarantees, you would no longer have a claim against us or the guarantors or (y) in the case of the liens granted to secure the notes, you would no longer have a secured claim against us or the guarantors, as applicable. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining guarantors, if any. If a note, guarantee or a lien is avoided as a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or found to be unenforceable for any reason, you will not have a claim against that ----- obligor and will only be a creditor of the Issuer or any guarantor to the extent the Issuer’s or such guarantor’s obligation is not set aside or found to be unenforceable. You may also be required to return payments you have received, as the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from us or the guarantors with respect to such note, guarantees and liens. In addition, any payment by us pursuant to the notes or by a guarantor made at a time when the Issuer or such guarantor is subsequently found to be insolvent could be avoided and required to be returned to us or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Issuer’s or the guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days to any non-insider party and such payment would give the holders of notes more than such holders of notes would have received in a liquidation under Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended, or the “Bankruptcy Code.” As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for such guarantee and/or lien if such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes and/or such guarantee and/or lien. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent conveyance or transfer and preferences laws will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding. Generally, however, the Issuer would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of the Issuer’s indebtedness, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all the Issuer’s assets; - the present fair saleable value of the Issuer’s assets were less than the amount that would be required to pay the Issuer’s probable liability on existing indebtedness, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - the Issuer could not pay the Issuer’s debts as they become due. The Issuer cannot assure you as to the standard a court would apply in making such determinations or that a court would agree with the Issuer’s conclusions in this regard that the Issuer and the guarantors will not be insolvent or rendered insolvent by the issuance of the notes and the guarantees. Regardless of the actual standard applied by the court, we cannot be certain that the issuance of the notes, a guarantee, or the granting of liens would not be avoided as a preference, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance, or otherwise, or that the issuance of the notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to the Issuer’s or any guarantor’s other debt. The indentures that will govern the notes offered hereby will contain a “savings clause,” which limits the liability of each guarantor on its guarantee to the maximum amount that such guarantor can incur without risk that its guarantee will be subject to avoidance as a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer. The Issuer cannot assure you such a savings clause limitation, as a legal matter will protect such guarantees from fraudulent conveyance or transfer challenges or, if it does, that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would suffice, if necessary, to pay the notes in full. Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the notes to other claims against us under the principle of “equitable subordination”, if the court determines that: (1) the holders of the notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (2) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to the Issuer’s other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holder of the notes; and (3) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.",,,,N/A
25_1,Offerings 2020.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes,1.1.11,The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a Change of Control required by the indenture that will govern the notes.,"Upon a Change of Control, as defined under the indenture that will govern the notes, you will have the right to require the Issuer to offer to purchase the notes then outstanding at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount ----- of such notes, plus accrued interest. In order to obtain sufficient funds to pay the purchase price of the outstanding notes, the Issuer may need to refinance the notes and/or the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. However, it is possible that the Issuer will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the notes. If the Issuer is required to repurchase the notes, the Issuer could require third-party financing. The Issuer cannot be sure that it would be able to obtain third-party financing on acceptable terms, or at all. The Issuer’s failure to offer to purchase all outstanding notes or to purchase all validly tendered notes would be an event of default under the indenture that will govern the notes. Such an event of default may cause the acceleration of the Issuer’s other debt, including debt under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The Issuer’s future debt also may contain restrictions on repayment requirements with respect to specified events or transactions that constitute a change of control under the indenture that will govern the notes. The indenture governing the Existing Unsecured Notes also contains similar change of control offer provisions. The credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities also provide that a change of control is an event of default that permits lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Any of our future debt arrangements may contain similar provisions. If the Issuer is required to repurchase the notes pursuant to a change of control offer and repay certain amounts outstanding under such other indebtedness, the Issuer would probably require third-party financing. The Issuer cannot be sure that it would be able to obtain third-party financing on acceptable terms, or at all. If the indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities is not paid, the lenders thereunder may seek to enforce security interests in the collateral, thereby limiting the Issuer’s ability to raise cash to purchase the notes, and reducing the practical benefit of the offer to purchase provisions to the holders of the notes.",,,,N/A

However, the phrase “all or substantially all” will likely be interpreted under applicable state law and will be dependent upon particular facts and circumstances.

The Issuer expects the notes to be eligible for trading by “qualified institutional buyers,” as defined under and pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act or pursuant to Regulation S. The Issuer intends to apply to list the notes on the Official List of the Exchange. This listing application for the notes will be subject to approval by the Authority. There are no assurances that the notes will be listed and admitted to trade on the Official List of the Exchange. The initial purchasers have advised the Issuer that they intend to make a market in the notes, as permitted by applicable laws and regulations; however, the initial purchasers are not obligated to make a market in the notes and, if commenced, they may discontinue their market-making activities at any time without notice. Therefore, an active market for the notes may not develop or be maintained, which would adversely affect the market price and liquidity of the notes. In such case, the holders of the notes may not be able to sell their notes at a particular time or at a favorable price. If a trading market were to develop, future trading prices of the notes may be volatile and will depend on many factors, some of which are beyond the Issuer’s control, including: - the number of holders of notes; - the Issuer’s operating performance and financial condition; - the market for similar securities; - the interest of securities dealers in making a market for the notes; - prevailing interest rates; and - the aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding. Even if an active trading market for the notes does develop, there is no guarantee that it will continue. Historically, the market for non-investment grade indebtedness has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. The market, if any, for the notes may experience similar disruptions and any such disruptions may adversely affect the liquidity in that market or the prices at which you may sell your notes.

No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this offering of the notes, and the fair market value of the Collateral will be subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, changing economic conditions, competition and other future trends. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the holders of the notes will be entitled to be repaid in full from the proceeds of the Collateral before any payment is made in respect of any other indebtedness secured by a junior lien on such Collateral or unsecured (including, without limitation, the Existing Unsecured Notes). Moreover, the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the holders of any other additional indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral will share the proceeds of such Collateral ratably with the holders of the notes, thereby diluting the Collateral coverage available to holders of the notes. In particular, the fair market value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to repay the holders of the notes upon any foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding and after the repayment of indebtedness with prior security interests in the Collateral, if any. There also can be no assurance that the Collateral will be saleable, and even if saleable, the timing of its liquidation would be uncertain. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient Collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the notes. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the notes from the sale of the Collateral securing the notes and the obligations under the notes will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness (including, without limitation, the Existing Unsecured Notes) and other obligations, including trade payables. In addition, as discussed further below, the holders of the notes would not be entitled to receive post-petition interest or applicable fees, costs, expenses, or charges to the extent the amount of the obligations due under the notes exceeded the value of the Collateral (after taking into account all other first-priority debt that was also secured by the Collateral), or any “adequate protection” on account of any undersecured portion of the notes. See “—In the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuer or any of the guarantors, holders of the notes may be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that the Issuer’s obligations in respect of the notes exceed the fair market value of the Collateral securing the notes and the related guarantees.” With respect to some of the Collateral, the security interest of the Notes Collateral Agent for the notes and its ability to foreclose will also be limited by the need to meet certain requirements, such as obtaining third-party consents and making additional filings. If the Issuer is unable to obtain these consents or make these filings, the security interests may be invalid and the holders will not be entitled to the Collateral or any recovery with respect thereto. We cannot assure you that any such required consents will be obtained on a timely basis or at all. These requirements may limit the number of potential bidders for certain Collateral in any foreclosure or other auction and may delay any sale, either of which events may have an adverse effect on the sale price of the Collateral. Therefore, the practical value of realizing on the Collateral may, without the appropriate consents and filings, be limited. Under the terms of the indenture that will govern the notes, the Issuer will be permitted to incur indebtedness in amounts in excess of the current commitments under Senior Secured Credit Facilities. All of the commitments under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are secured by the Collateral on a first-priority lien basis and will be entitled to payment out of the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the holders of the notes. The indenture that will govern the notes will also permit the Issuer and the guarantors to create additional liens on the Collateral under specified circumstances, some of which liens may be pari passu with or senior to the liens securing the notes. Any obligations secured by such liens may further dilute the collateral coverage and limit the recovery from the realization of the collateral available to satisfy holders of the notes.

Under that first lien intercreditor agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to such Collateral, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against such Collateral and to control such proceedings, will be at the exclusive direction of the collateral agent under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities until the earlier of (1) the date on which the Issuer’s obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are discharged (which discharge does not include certain refinancings of the senior secured credit facilities) or (2) 90 days after the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture that will govern the notes and acceleration of the obligations thereunder, if the notes represent the largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral (including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) and the collateral agent for the notes has complied with the applicable notice provisions so long as the agent under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities has not commenced the exercise of remedies with respect to Collateral or the Issuer or any guarantor is not then a debtor in any bankruptcy or similar insolvency or liquidation proceeding. After the discharge of the obligations with respect to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the right to direct the actions with respect to the Collateral securing the notes will pass to the authorized representative of holders of the then largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first lien on the Collateral. If the Issuer issues additional indebtedness that is equal in priority to the lien securing the Issuer’s notes in the future in a greater principal amount than the notes, then the authorized representative for such additional indebtedness would be next in line to exercise rights under the first lien intercreditor agreement, rather than the trustee as the collateral agent for the notes. Accordingly, the trustee under the indenture that will govern the notes may never have the right to control remedies and take other actions with respect to the Collateral. In addition, under the terms of the first lien intercreditor agreement, if at any time the controlling collateral agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Collateral resulting in a sale thereof, the lien securing the notes on such Collateral will be automatically released and discharged (provided that any proceeds from such sale are applied ratably among all the then outstanding first-priority obligations). The Collateral so released will no longer secure the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ obligations under the notes and the related guarantees. The first lien intercreditor agreement will also prohibit the trustee and the collateral agent for the notes from objecting following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to a proposed debtor-in-possession financing to be provided to us that is secured by the Collateral or to the use of cash collateral that has not been opposed to or objected to by the controlling collateral agent or the other controlling secured parties, subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions. After such a filing, the value of the Collateral could materially deteriorate, and holders of the notes would be unable to raise an objection. Also, under the first lien intercreditor agreement, in the event that the holders of the notes obtain possession of any Collateral or realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such Collateral at any time prior to the discharge of each of the other first-priority obligations, then such holders will be obligated to hold such collateral, proceeds, or payment in trust for the other holders of first-priority obligations and, subject to the first lien intercreditor agreement, promptly transfer such collateral, proceeds, or payment, as the case may be, to the controlling collateral agent, to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the first lien intercreditor agreement among all the holders of first-priority obligations. Thus, there can be no assurances that under the first lien intercreditor agreement, the holders of the notes would not be obligated to turn over to the other holders of the first-priority obligations any Collateral, proceeds or payments they may receive.

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as the collateral agent for the notes, is prohibited from foreclosing upon or repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security repossessed from a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). Moreover, bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and use Collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of the Collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to the circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the Collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the Collateral as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the Collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for a diminution in the value of its Collateral if the value of the Collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of both the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict how, whether or when payments under the notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case, the length of the delay in making any such payments or whether any such payment will be made at all or in what form, whether or when the collateral agent could or would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, or whether or to what extent or in what form holders of the notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of the value of the Collateral through the requirements of “adequate protection.” Furthermore, any disposition of the Collateral during a bankruptcy case outside of the ordinary course of business would also require approval from the bankruptcy court (which may not be given under the circumstances). Also, in the event the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the notes and all of our other outstanding First Lien Obligations, as defined under the heading “Description of Notes,” the holders of the notes would be “undersecured.” U.S. bankruptcy laws do not provide for the payment or accrual of interest, costs and attorneys’ fees on the “undersecured” portion of a creditor claims during a debtor’s bankruptcy case nor is a creditor entitled to adequate protection on account of any undersecured portion of its claims. ----- In addition, as noted above, the first lien intercreditor agreement will prohibit the trustee and the collateral agent for the notes from objecting following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to a proposed debtor-in-possession financing to be provided to us that is secured by the Collateral or to the use of cash collateral that has not been opposed to or objected to by the controlling collateral agent or the other controlling secured parties, subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions.

Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. The liens on the Collateral securing the notes may not be perfected if the Issuer is not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens on or prior to the date of the issuance of the notes or thereafter. We will have limited obligations to perfect the security interest of the holders of the notes in specified collateral other than the filing of financing statements. To the extent a security interest in certain collateral is not perfected on the date of the issuance of the notes, such security interest might be avoidable in bankruptcy, which could impact the value of the Collateral. See “—Any future pledge of Collateral or issuance of a guarantee might be avoidable by a trustee in bankruptcy.” If additional material wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries are formed or acquired and become guarantors under the indentures that will govern notes, additional financing statements would be required to be filed to perfect the security interest in the assets of such guarantors. Depending on the type of the assets constituting afteracquired collateral, additional action may be required to be taken by the Issuer for the notes or the collateral agent for the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, to perfect the security interest in such assets, such as the delivery of physical collateral, the execution of account control agreements or the execution and recordation of mortgages or deeds of trust. Applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can be perfected only at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. Neither the trustee nor the collateral agent for the notes will be responsible to monitor, and there can be no assurance that the Issuer will inform the trustee or the collateral agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. The collateral agent for the notes and the collateral agent for the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will have no obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute Collateral or the perfection of any security interests therein. Such inaction may result in the loss of the security interest in such Collateral or the priority of the ----- security interest in favor of the notes and the guarantees against third parties.

These risks include the risk that exchange rates may significantly change (including changes due to devaluation of the euro or revaluation of the holder’s currency) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the holder’s currency may impose or modify exchange controls. An investment in the notes by a purchaser whose home currency is not euro entails significant risks. These risks generally depend on factors over which we have no control, such as economic, financial and political events and the supply of and demand for the relevant currencies. In the past, rates of exchange between euro and certain currencies have been highly volatile, and each holder should be aware that volatility may occur in the future. Fluctuations in any particular exchange rate that have occurred in the past, however, are not necessarily indicative of fluctuations in the rate that may occur during the term of the notes. An appreciation in the value of the holder’s currency relative to the euro would decrease the holder’s currency-equivalent yield on the notes, the holder’s currency-equivalent value of the principal payable on the notes and the holder’s currency-equivalent market value of the notes, and, in certain circumstances, could result in a loss to the holder. See “Currency Presentation and Exchange Rate Data.” Governments and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate.

Under New York law, a New York state court rendering a judgment on the notes would be required to render the judgment in euros. However, in such a situation, the judgment would then be converted into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of entry of such judgment by the New York State court. Consequently, in a lawsuit for payment on the notes, investors of such notes would bear currency exchange risk until a New York state court judgment is entered, which could be a long time. In addition, a federal court in New York presiding over a dispute arising in connection with the notes may apply the foregoing New York law or in certain circumstances may render the judgment in U.S. dollars. In courts outside of New York, investors of such notes may not be able to obtain a judgment in a currency other than U.S. dollars. For example, a judgment for money in an action based on the notes in many other U.S. federal or state courts ordinarily would be enforced in the United States only in U.S. dollars. The date used to determine the rate of conversion of euros into U.S. dollars would depend upon various factors, including which court renders the judgment and when the judgment is rendered.

This COVID 19 outbreak has since spread and grown globally, including in each of the countries in which we operate, and was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Although the ultimate severity and impact of the COVID 19 pandemic remains uncertain, the COVID 19 pandemic and measures taken to combat it have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant negative impact on the economy in the countries in which we operate and the automotive industry as a whole. The measures taken to combat COVID 19 include restrictions on public life, curfews, forced temporary business closures (including the closure of significant elements of our business) and lockdowns as well as social distancing protocols and the general advice to stay at home given the health risks associated with COVID 19. As a result, all aspects of our business have been, and we expect will continue to be, materially negatively impacted. In the used vehicle market, car registration agencies and car dealerships were temporarily closed, car dealers sought to reduce their inventory and some consumers chose to delay or abandon car purchases. Due to the unprecedented level of disruption to society and the automotive industry, including to car dealers, leasing companies, fleet providers, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), wholesale traders and private consumers, as well as our employees and the way we operate our business, interactions at the Marketplace, particularly at physical auction and logistics sites were significantly impacted during the fiscal year 2021 with average weekly trading volume dipping to 4,000 at the start of the first quarter of the fiscal year 2021, compared to 29,000 at the start of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2020. In a number of countries our physical auctions and other operating sites have been required to close as a result of government legislation, as have many WeBuyAnyCar sites for periods of varying length. Interruptions to the businesses of our customers (including OEMs, leasing companies, dealers and fleet providers) resulted in unpredictable and reduced volumes of vehicles being handled by our Automotive Services division and a negative impact on trading performance. A significant proportion of our workforce (such as those involved in the physical movement of vehicles) cannot work remotely and potentially face additional risks as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic. In addition, some of our sites are visited by customers as part of their normal operations. We cannot guarantee that measures we take in order to limit the risks posed to such individuals will be sufficient and we may be subject to potential litigation or enforcement action as result of staff or customers alleging that our working practices are unsafe in this regard. Such litigation or enforcement action could result in material financial cost and damage to our reputation and brands. On July 10, 2020, out of an abundance of caution, we proactively and successfully negotiated certain covenant waivers with respect to certain of our existing debt facilities in order to mitigate the anticipated effects of the COVID 19 pandemic. These waivers were extended on January 22, 2021. However, a prolonged negative impact due to the COVID 19 pandemic or other factors may adversely affect our ability to comply with the financial covenants included in the Senior Facilities Agreement or any other similar agreement, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully negotiate the covenant waivers with our lenders in such an event. The breach of a financial or other covenant or the failure to meet any of the obligations under our ----- financing agreements governing our debt may result in a default or event of default under such agreements, which in turn could result in a number of adverse consequences, including cross-defaults, the acceleration of the outstanding amounts requiring immediate repayment of the related debt in part or in whole, significant increases in interest rates and other financing and reputational costs. There is also no guarantee that debt financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or that they will be available on terms consistent with our expectations. The COVID 19 pandemic has caused, and is likely to continue to cause, severe economic, market and other disruptions worldwide. It cannot be assured that conditions in the credit lending, capital and other financial markets will not deteriorate as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, or that our access to capital and other sources of funding will not become constrained or expensive, or that the credit or capital markets will be available in the future to fund our obligations. In addition, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants or require incremental collateral, which may restrict our business operations or make such debt unavailable due to our covenant restrictions then in effect. If we are unable to access the credit or capital markets in the longer term, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our ability to carry out growth and business development initiatives would be limited, thereby potentially limiting our future growth opportunities. We also carry significant intangible assets on our balance sheet. As of March 28, 2021, the intangible assets on our balance sheet totaled £1,937.9 million, including £938.5 million in goodwill relating to the CA Acquisition. Pursuant to current accounting rules, we are required to assess goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. Impairment indicators include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results and negative industry or economic trends. If such events were to occur, the carrying amount of our goodwill and other intangible assets may no longer be recoverable and we would be required to record an impairment charge. The COVID 19 pandemic and its impact on our business initially constituted an impairment indicator that we assessed and, accordingly, we recognized an exceptional goodwill impairment of £266.4 million in the 42-week period ended March 29, 2020. The impairment charge represented a change in the timing of vehicle volumes and associated discounted cash flows, which were expected through the Marketplace over the short term as economic activity recovers. See “Summary—Recent _Developments—Impact of COVID 19—Impairment Review” and “Operating and Financial Review—Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—COVID 19—Impairment Review.”_ As a matter of ordinary business operations, we are subject to potential credit risk related to our buyer finance services, BCA Partner Finance. The negative economic impact of the COVID 19 pandemic may increase such risk. While we maintain a well-established credit scoring matrix it cannot be assured that buyers repay their debt owed to us on a widespread and systemic basis over an extended period of time. We have participated in available government schemes designed to support businesses negatively impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic. These schemes include mechanisms to allow companies to place employees on paid leave or on reduced working hours, with the difference to an employee’s ordinary salary being partially reimbursed by the respective government. In the UK, we have furloughed as much as 80% of our staff at the peak of the COVID 19 pandemic in April 2020, such number subsequently dropping below 60% by June 2020, and as of March 28, 2021, approximately 4% of our employees remained on short-term work. In addition, we have also applied for and made use of employee salary support schemes introduced by certain governments in the UK and continental Europe. While we are carefully tailoring our use of these COVID 19 prompted measures to ensure retention of the necessary knowledge and expertise to support the business going forward, as a result of these measures, there could be a loss of institutional knowledge, experience, and/or expertise which could limit our ability to manage the business effectively, react to external developments, retain vendors and make necessary technological developments. Similarly, these measures may negatively impact the morale of our workforce, leading to voluntary departures of additional employees. In addition, there can be no guarantee that similar schemes will be available in the future in the event of further COVID 19 or similar public health related disruption. In the event of future disruption and in the absence of similar support schemes, related costs may be significantly higher than experienced during the previous periods of COVID 19 restrictions with a negative impact on our ability to operate. The overall impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on our business remains uncertain and will ultimately depend on a number of factors that cannot be accurately predicted at this time. These factors include, but are not limited to, the duration (including the extent of any resurgence in the future) and the ultimate severity of the COVID 19 pandemic, the timing of and manner in which containment efforts are reduced or lifted and the ----- length of time it takes for normal economic and operating conditions to resume, which are all beyond our knowledge and control. Moreover, there are no comparable recent events that provide us with guidance. For these reasons, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on our business with any certainty nor can we provide any assurance that the COVID 19 pandemic will not continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. To the extent the COVID 19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks described in this section of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Risk Factors,” including those relating to our high level of indebtedness, our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness, and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness, including the indenture governing the Notes. In addition, as a consequence of the significantly increased volatility and instability experienced during periods of challenging macroeconomic conditions, it is difficult for us to forecast demand trends. We may be unable to accurately predict the extent or duration of cycles or their effect on our financial condition or result of operations and can give no assurance as to the timing, extent or duration of the current or future macroeconomic cycles. A decline in demand due to adverse macroeconomic conditions may also have an adverse impact on the business of the automotive industry and require us to substantially increase the amounts of financial assistance, to carry on our operations.",,,,N/A
31,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,1.1.2,"We are exposed to general economic, political and regulatory conditions and risks in the countries in which we have operations and customers.","We operate in the UK and in a number of continental European countries while selling vehicles to buyers in a wider geographic area. Consequently, our business and financial results are affected, directly and indirectly, by global economic conditions, such as instability in credit markets, declining consumer and business confidence, interest rates, volatile exchange rates, and other challenges such as uncertain or changing political or regulatory environments. A potential prolonged economic slowdown in the UK and continental Europe resulting from the COVID 19 pandemic poses a risk to our customers, our suppliers, our employees and the communities in which they and we operate. The current status of the COVID 19 pandemic around the world remains serious, and while there is cause for optimism (with the continuing progress on vaccinations across European countries and the UK in particular), there can be no assurance that vaccinations are effective and reopening will not be reversed in response to a resurgence in COVID 19 outbreaks. Negative economic developments, including due to global or local recessions, higher unemployment rates, diminished levels of consumer confidence, declines in income levels and the loss of wealth, have resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in decreased demand in the automotive industry. The ongoing COVID 19 pandemic may be associated with further or continued decline in economic activity and increase in unemployment levels which may negatively impact the demand for vehicles from consumers and business users. Since we rely on strong demand for the used vehicle market, we are particularly dependent on consumer confidence and spending power, two factors that are strongly influenced by overall economic conditions. Moreover, national and local governments may impose limitations and restrictions on the operation of our business in response to any future COVID 19 resurgence, and the impact of those restrictions may have a detrimental effect on our ability to operate (including but not limited to social distancing and other health and safety related measures, and possibly preventing or restricting some elements of our business from trading at all). Compliance with such regulations requires the application of financial and human resources and increases costs to the potential detriment of our business. Failure by us to comply, or the perception of non-compliance, with any such regulations may lead to enforcement action against us with possible financial costs and could also damage our brands and reputation. Although the used vehicle market has some countercyclical characteristics, adverse economic conditions in the countries where we have operations may negatively impact our financial results, and that of our vendors and buyers. Activity levels in the automotive industry can be affected by such factors as the availability of consumer credit, the growth of average wages and the level of unemployment, among others, which in turn could impact the volume of vehicles we handle. In addition, if OEMs in the UK were to experience declining new vehicles sales, the used vehicle market could in turn be negatively impacted, which would affect our Vehicle Buying division and Vehicle Remarketing division. Due to the relative size of our UK operations, compared to our operations in continental Europe, we are more exposed to changes in the UK economic environment. ----- The wider geopolitical environment in the UK and continental Europe is also beyond our control. Our business and operations are adversely affected by unstable or deteriorating international trade conditions. For example, the withdrawal of the UK from the EU effective December 31, 2020 (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) have resulted in substantial regulatory uncertainty regarding international trade and trade policy. Moreover, our international operations are subject to risks associated with the prevailing local political, economic and regulatory climate. For instance, it may be more difficult in certain jurisdictions for us to enforce contracts, collect receivables, terminate labor contracts, receive dividends and transfer funds. In addition, we may face risks associated with unexpected changes in the regulatory environment, particularly in relation to complexity of domestic and international customs and tariffs, potentially adverse tax consequences, restrictions on foreign trade or investment, currency exchange and capital controls, nationalization and expropriation and cancelation of our contractual relationships without full compensation for loss. Any of the aforementioned changes to general economic, political and regulatory conditions, and in particular any changes in the regulatory environment and potentially adverse tax consequences as a result thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A
31,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,1.1.3,We are dependent on the supply of vehicles to the Marketplace.,"Our business is vulnerable to fluctuations in the supply of vehicles to our sales platforms, including our digital and physical auction sites (together, the “Marketplace”), which in turn depends on a variety of factors. For example, declines in demand in the automotive industry resulting from adverse macroeconomic conditions have historically adversely impacted used vehicle trade-ins to dealers, which has in turn reduced our auction volumes, as dealers represent a large proportion of our vendors. In addition, the supply of vehicles from corporate vendors, including contract hire, leasing and finance companies, can also be affected by adverse economic conditions if corporate vendors reduce the size of, or delay the renewal of, their fleets during an economic downturn. OEMs have also in the past reduced the number of vehicles manufactured during periods of macroeconomic decline, which, over time, can adversely affect the number of used vehicles in the market and thus the supply of vehicles to the Marketplace. Additionally, legislative and regulatory changes could adversely affect the supply of vehicles to the Marketplace. Furthermore, the supply of vehicles could also decrease if our vendors elect to sell their vehicles directly to our buyers, including private consumers. If, as a result of the foregoing factors or for any other reason, the supply of vehicles to the Marketplace declines, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, our ability to provide a large, attractive offering of used vehicles within our Vehicle Remarketing division depends on the number and quality of used vehicles we are able to purchase through WeBuyAnyCar, and the public’s willingness to tender their vehicles to our Vehicle Buying division. There can be no assurance that the supply of suitable vehicles at competitive prices will be sufficient to meet our needs and to continue to grow our offering. In addition, difficulties in sourcing a suitable inventory of used vehicles may arise, among others, due to errors from the proprietary pricing model we use to calculate purchase prices within WeBuyAnyCar, or a failure to adjust our pricing model in order to meet the most recent market trends. If we are unable to source a suitable inventory at competitive prices as a result of any of these factors, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.",,,,N/A

The majority of sales arrangements with our vendors do not guarantee the provision of a minimum number of vehicles to us. Accordingly, we cannot give any assurance that our largest vendors will continue to provide us with a supply of vehicles, or that we would be able to replace the volumes of vehicles provided by these vendors were they to materially decrease. In addition, if one or more of our vendors’ financial condition deteriorates, or if a vendor were to restructure its operations, our loss of access to the vendor’s vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A

Although the used vehicle market has some countercyclical characteristics, no assurance can be given that ----- such market remains stable in times of economic downturn. A decline in demand from our buyers could be caused by a variety of factors, including adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions, such as stagnant growth, a decline in disposable income or consumer confidence and restricted access to consumer financing. High fuel prices may also disproportionately affect demand for vehicles with poor fuel-efficiency and lead to a reduction in the miles driven per vehicle, which could affect the number of vehicles sold through the Marketplace. Additionally, rising interest rates may depress sales of new or used vehicles because many purchasers finance their purchases. Furthermore, adverse changes in the credit quality of our buyers, arising from macroeconomic conditions or otherwise, could also lead to lower sales, as well as increase our counterparty risk. Any reduction in demand for used vehicles caused by these or any other reason could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A
31,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,1.1.6,We may be adversely affected by a general decline in vehicle ownership or sudden changes in demand for certain types of used vehicles.,"Demand for our used vehicles may be adversely affected by trends that lead to an overall decline in demand for vehicles. For example, environmental concerns surrounding certain types of vehicle (older diesel vehicles, for example) or a growing share of younger people choosing not to purchase or lease their own vehicles, opting for ride-hailing services, ride-sharing services, car rental services and public transportation instead. These trends may continue or even intensify, in particular as urbanization continues and a growing share of the population migrates to major cities. As a result, overall demand for vehicles, including for used vehicles, may decline, which could adversely affect our business prospects. Furthermore, demand for certain types of used vehicles may suddenly decline due to the introduction of innovative technologies for new vehicles (e.g., autonomous driving systems). There is no guarantee that we will be able to quickly source more innovative vehicles as it may take several years before they become available in the used vehicle market. Consequently, sourcing and selling such vehicles may be more complex. Likewise, actions by OEMs or car dealers may have a significant impact on demand in the used vehicle market. If these parties decide to offer greater incentives for the sale of new vehicles (e.g., discounts or attractive financing), or generally lower prices for new vehicles, this could make buying a new vehicle more attractive. As a result, prices for used vehicles and our associated fees may decline. Prices may also decline due to insolvencies of rental car companies or other companies with large fleets or an increased number of returns of leased vehicles, which could result in oversupply. Conversely, any significant increase in market prices due to a scarcity of used vehicles could impact our ability to source desirable inventory at acceptable prices and our volume turnaround, which could have a material adverse effect on our continued growth and margins.",,,,N/A

The Vehicle Buying division and the Vehicle Remarketing division face competition from other vehicle buying and remarketing companies both in the UK and continental Europe. In the Automotive Services division, we face competition from a broad range of competitors. Due to the increasing use of the Internet and other technology as remarketing and distribution channels, we also face increasing competition from online wholesale and retail vehicle selling platforms as well as from our own vendors when they sell directly to end consumers rather than remarket vehicles through the Marketplace. Increased competition could result in reduced profitability and/or loss of market share. Our future success may be impacted by our ability to respond to evolving industry trends, changes in buyer and vendor requirements and new technologies. Furthermore, some of our competitors may have greater financial and marketing resources, may be able to respond more quickly to evolving industry dynamics and changes in vendor or buyer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of new or emerging services and technologies.

31,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,1.1.8,A disruption in supply chains may adversely affect our Vehicle Remarketing division and Automotive Services division.,"Our Vehicle Remarketing division and Automotive Services division offer a wide range of non-auction services, such as inspection, appraisal, repair and refurbishment, storage and handling. These services expose us to supply chain risks, as we are dependent on the availability of certain automotive parts and skilled labor ----- to ensure that vehicles can move seamlessly along the automotive value chain, from collection through inspection, repairs and onwards sale. Any reduction, or any delays or disruptions, in the supply chains of the materials and components used by our Vehicle Remarketing division or Automotive Services division could result in a significant disruption to our operations and affect our ability to meet our commitments. Similarly, the lack of skilled labor to undertake inspection, appraisal, repair and refurbishment, storage as well as handling services could result in a significant disruption to our operations. These disruptions may result from many reasons, including increasing demands for certain automotive parts, closures of suppliers’ plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes, mechanical failures or breakdowns, electrical outages, fire, explosions, political upheaval, competition for skilled labor as well as logistical complications resulting from severe weather or other natural disasters and delayed customs processing. Financial difficulties of our major suppliers may also lead to delays in the delivery of materials and components. The unavailability of any automotive parts or skilled labor required to deliver our inspection, appraisal, repair and refurbishment, storage and handling services could cause our Vehicle Remarketing division and Automotive Services division to incur significant delays. The risk of disruptions in the supply of materials and components that we use is heightened due to the greater political, economic and social instability created by Brexit, which may lead to further complications with respect to customs processing and/or may lead to limited transportation infrastructure and difficulties in finding alternative reliable, costefficient and qualified suppliers that can freely move between the UK and continental Europe. Brexit and the related restrictions on free movement of labor across the English Channel has also heightened the risk that skilled labor may be unavailable.

31,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,1.1.9,"Our business is dependent on certain information and technology systems, and the failure to effectively maintain, protect, develop or update these systems or cyber security attacks could have a negative impact on our business.","Our business and financial performance depend on the effective operation of our information and technology systems, increasingly including our cloud-hosted and digital selling platforms. It is therefore essential that key systems, software and hardware are operational at all times. Substantially all of our remarketing buyers access our systems via websites and/or mobile applications to view vehicles coming to auction prior to participating in our auctions, and to participate in the various types of auctions and Bid Now/Buy Now sales themselves. In addition, our customers also use WeBuyAnyCar’s online vehicle pricing quotation system to obtain a valuation of their vehicle. We are therefore reliant on the operation of WeBuyAnyCar’s online platform, as well as a number of mobile applications, which offer vehicle search functions, bidding features and access to live information such as pricing, vehicle condition, and individual lot/auction timings. Our digital services are accessed by a large number of users, often at the same time, and if user traffic increases, we may not be able to scale our technology to accommodate increased capacity requirements, which may result in interruptions or delays in service. The business is also reliant on the systems that power the Automotive Services division’s remote operations, such as transporters, inspect and collect operatives, appraisers and imaging. We rely on a large range of computer and other information systems which are essential to our operations and which became even more important during the COVID 19 pandemic, when our operating model shifted towards an online business. Accordingly, the continued and uninterrupted performance of those systems, along with their development and implementation, are vital factors in the operation of our business. We depend on our technical infrastructure for all aspects of the day-to-day management of our business and the delivery of our services. Any material disruption to the operation of such infrastructure, including as a result of legislative and regulatory changes regarding online sales and e-commerce, may materially and negatively affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Interruptions in these systems, whether due to system failures, computer viruses, software errors or physical or electronic break-ins, or other factors could affect the security or availability of our products and services on our websites or mobile applications and prevent or inhibit the ability of vendors and buyers to access our services. Electronic break-ins and cyber security attacks continue to increase in both prevalence and sophistication throughout the digital world with the potential to corrupt, affect or destroy key systems and data, including the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our data and systems. Given that techniques used in these break-ins and attacks change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, it may be impossible to properly secure our systems. In addition, technical advances or a continued expansion and increased complexity of our digital offering could increase the likelihood of security breaches. The risk of electronic break-ins and cyber security attacks includes breaches and attempted breaches not only of our own products, services and systems, but also of those of our customers, employees, contractors, business partners, and other third parties as well as of third-party systems on which we rely to operate our digital platforms. ----- Successful breaches, employee malfeasance, or human or technological error could result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of our data or systems or those of our customers or other third parties, theft of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property, loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware, destructive attacks or other means, and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service. In addition, the fast-paced, evolving, pervasive and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the scale and complexity of the business and infrastructure, make it possible that certain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack on one of our customers and its customers. Furthermore, these risks will increase as we continue to shift of our operating model towards an online business in response to the COVID 19 pandemic. Problems with the reliability, availability or security of our systems and digital service offerings could harm our reputation, result in a loss of vendors or buyers or necessitate additional costs, fines or penalties, any of which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Certain vendors, as a condition of operating through us, audit our information and technology systems. These audits may require significant management time to address and could result in costly changes to information and technology systems as a condition of continued operation. The loss of the supply of vehicles from a vendor or the cost of changes to our information and technology systems following an audit could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Robust back office systems, including auction information systems, are also critical to our ability to attract visitors to our websites. These systems are also imperative for the operation of our website and mobile applications, pricing, third-party data feeds, customer service, internal and external communications, procurement, logistics, administration and financial reporting. In addition, we are dependent on certain third-party information and technology systems, particularly with respect to payment processing, vehicle licensing checks and fraud detection. In particular, we face liability risks in connection with online credit card fraud and problems adequately securing our payment systems, despite using market-standard protocols designed to ensure enhanced security and strong identification for our customers when they use their debit or credit cards for vehicle purchases. The failure or unavailability of any of our information and technology systems to detect such type of fraud or other errors with respect to payment processing or vehicle licensing checks could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Much of our physical information and technology infrastructure (including servers, website hosting, database storage and wide area networks) is supplied by service providers via managed services contracts. Technical or other service problems faced by our managed service providers could adversely affect the experience of our vendors and buyers. Any financial or operational difficulties faced by our managed service providers or any of the third-party service providers with whom they contract may have adverse effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict. Furthermore, any disruption of the distribution channels or networks used by our mobile applications could adversely affect the ability to access or update our mobile applications, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Our success also depends on our continued innovation and ability to provide features that make our websites and mobile applications user-friendly, particularly through the development of specific software and applications under a variety of new platforms and operating systems, which are generally expected by users to offer the same features or flexibility and to be as easily and intuitively operated as desktop interfaces. As technology improves and as our operations grow in size, scope and complexity, we will need to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure, which may require substantial financial, operational and technical resources. Delays or difficulties in implementing new or enhanced systems may impair our ability to provide digital services to our vendors and buyers or may reduce the effectiveness of digital auctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A
31,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,1.1.10,Acceptance of our digital platforms and mobile applications as suitable platforms for the sale and purchase of used vehicles may decrease or fail to improve.,"The restrictions on physical sales activity (including physical auctions) due to the COVID 19 pandemic has significantly increased the volume of vehicles traded digitally across the used vehicle market and via the Marketplace. While the acceptance of our digital platforms has been strong by both buyers and vendors, there is no guarantee that overall online acceptance in the used vehicle market will be maintained or increased. If the acceptance of our digital offering decreases or fails to grow, we may not be able to achieve the future growth we target. -----",,,,N/A

We are liable for the vehicles we own (the majority of which are purchased through the Vehicle Buying division) and, in many cases, we are liable for the vehicles supplied by vendors for auction through the Vehicle Remarketing division, as well as when we collect and deliver vehicles through our logistics services. Extreme weather, such as hail storms, fire and flooding, which has in the past damaged vehicles in our possession, natural disasters (such as extreme precipitation or extreme temperature) or other catastrophic events (such as terrorism and large-scale accidents) may adversely affect our physical facilities or damage vehicles awaiting sale or vehicles generally stored by us. Such risks are particularly prevalent in respect of our open air facilities. In addition, there is no assurance that used vehicles in our inventory will be properly protected (e.g., against theft or vandalism). This may result in an increase in costs, delay or cancelation of auction sales, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability. Our failure to meet vendors’ or buyers’ demands in such situations could further adversely affect our reputation, reduce customer satisfaction, damage relationships with both vendors and buyers and result in a loss of future business. We maintain insurance cover for risks including property damage, business interruption, employers and public liability, as well as for certain other claims consistent with customary practice in the industry in which we operate. However, claims not covered by our insurance or in excess of our insurance coverage may arise, such as from a natural disaster, theft or other causes outside our control. Moreover, we may be unable in future periods to obtain insurance coverage on acceptable terms, without substantial premiums increase or at all, particularly if there is deterioration in our claim experience history. A successful claim against us, which is not covered by or in excess of our coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A
31,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,1.1.12,"We are subject to complex taxation in multiple jurisdictions, in particular relating to valued-added taxes.","We are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions, including in the UK and continental Europe. Because of the complex interplay between our business and the various taxation regimes to which we are subject, the provision made for taxes in the accounts involves a significant amount of judgement and uncertainty regarding the interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes to existing tax laws or tax reporting obligations, or the introduction of new tax laws or obligations (for instance with regards to online sales), in any of these jurisdictions could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The risks associated to unforeseen changes to existing tax laws or tax reporting obligations are compounded by the uncertainty created by Brexit and legislatives changes in connection thereto (see “—We are exposed to general economic, political and regulatory conditions and risks in _the countries in which we have operations and customers”) and the shift of our operating model towards an_ online business in response to the COVID 19 pandemic (see “—The COVID 19 pandemic has had, and will _continue to have, a significant adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, operating results and liquidity, and the ultimate outcome of the COVID 19 pandemic is uncertain”)._ Additionally, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in many countries involving VAT and other indirect taxes. In the jurisdictions in which we operate, we are responsible for collecting any VAT amounts due on the vehicles we sell, and we rely on our vendors to provide accurate and complete information relating to the VAT status of each vehicle to enable us to calculate the amount of any VAT due. We also rely on purchasers of our vehicles at auction to provide accurate information regarding their residency in order to assess appropriate treatment of VAT for sales invoices. If a vendor or buyer provides incorrect or incomplete VATrelated information, or if we fail to implement or fully comply with local VAT rules and regulations, we may be exposed to VAT claims and fines from relevant authorities. In the ordinary course of our business, we are frequently subject to VAT and other tax audits by relevant authorities throughout Europe, and these audits can relate to matters that arose many years in the past. The outcome of these audits could result in additional VAT claims and/or regulatory actions against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A
31,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,1.1.13,We may not successfully implement our strategic initiatives.,"Our future operating results are dependent, in part, on our success in implementing our strategic and tactical initiatives. These initiatives are focused on enhancing our competitive advantage as an integrated end-to-end ----- service provider, further expanding internationally, strengthening our infrastructure and logistics network, capitalizing on favorable industry trends, continuing to enhance our data capabilities and improving our operational efficiencies, cash flow and leverage. These initiatives will require extensive planning and management attention and entail substantial execution risk. Notably, our strategy is focused on meaningful growth of vehicle volumes transaction through our marketplaces. Such volume growth requires simultaneous success in several different domains including: (i) commercial success with vendors, so they supply higher volume to our marketplaces; (ii) maintained data leadership in order for the marketplaces to provide efficient liquidity to all participants; (iii) digital product leadership to make our integrated services offering the most relevant in the market; and (iv) best-in-class logistics and services footprint to deliver an integrated end-to-end digital and physical service. Failure to maintain our competitive advantages in any of these dimension could have a material could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, new digital platforms will also require substantial IT support and infrastructure and, as we grow, we will need to ensure our back-office IT systems are integrated across our operations. With respect to the Vehicle Buying division, our strategy places particular importance on expanding WeBuyAnyCar’s operations. However, there can be no assurance that WeBuyAnyCar will continue to grow in the UK. As we seek to expand car buying into new markets, we may also need to comply with unfamiliar regulatory regimes. In addition, because car buying involves purchasing vehicles and holding them as inventory until their sale (in contrast to our UK Vehicle Remarketing division and our International Vehicle Remarketing division, which do not include WeBuyAnyCar’s operations, and do not take title to the majority of vehicles that they sell), the expansion of such operations may increase our cash requirements and inventory risk, thereby increasing our depreciation and impairment charges. Similarly, recalls by OEMs are a common occurrence and have accelerated in frequency and scope in recent years. In case of such recalls, we may have to temporarily remove the affected used vehicles from our inventory and may be unable to liquidate such inventory in a timely manner or at all. The same may occur if regulatory changes (e.g., the introduction of stricter emission standards) prevent consumers from driving certain used vehicles in cities or at all, consequently reducing demand for the affected vehicles. If we are unable to sell the vehicles purchased at an appropriate price, or at all, we may incur write-downs or our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, the implementation of our strategic initiatives in certain international markets may not produce the benefits achieved in markets where we already have established operations. Each new market that we enter will require us to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with that new market, which may entail finding new partners, hiring and training new staff with local language skills and an understanding of the local market, and learning the customs and cultures of the new country. These processes can be difficult, costly and divert management and personnel resources. Additionally, our business strategies may change from time to time, which could delay our ability to implement initiatives that we believe are important to our business. Our inability to successfully implement our strategic initiatives could result in, among others, the loss of clients and personnel, the loss of market share, the impairment of assets and inefficiencies from operating in new markets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A

The success of our acquisition strategy will depend on our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, to assess the value, strengths, weaknesses, contingent or other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates, to negotiate acceptable purchase terms, to obtain any necessary permits or approvals and to integrate the operations of such businesses, once acquired. Successful integration of future acquisitions will depend on our ability to effect any necessary changes in operations or personnel resulting from the acquisition. Acquisitions may also expose us to new risks, including difficulties in integrating and operating businesses in countries that are new to us, difficulties integrating acquired businesses in a cost-effective manner, unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual, employment or other issues or expenses arising out of an acquisition, potential disruptions to our ongoing business caused by acquisitions, including pressure on management’s time and resources, or an acquired business’ failure to meet our expectations or business plans.

To this end, we have entered into a £220 million non-recourse receivables facility (the “Receivables Facility”) with a syndicate of banks, who provide the liquidity to support our BCA Partner Finance business, of which £148.3 million was drawn as of March 28, 2021. If these banks are no longer willing to provide financing to us or only grant such financing on disadvantageous terms, we may not be able to offer attractive financing options to registered dealers. As a result, demand for our used vehicles may suffer and we may not be able to grow our business as envisaged. In addition, we use our sold vehicles as security when offering stock funding (trade finance) and cooperate with third-party collection agents to repossess such vehicles, should registered dealers default on their obligations. We may, however, not be able to locate the relevant vehicles and successfully repossess them (e.g., if they are transported outside the UK). Furthermore, the residual value of the repossessed vehicles may be lower than anticipated (e.g., if they are involved in accidents), and we may not be able to take recourse against the relevant car dealer. As a result, we may incur significant losses even where we use sold vehicles as security for BCA Partner Finance. See “Business—Operations—Value-Added Services—Post-auction Services.”",,,,N/A
31,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,1.1.16,We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights.,"Our intellectual property rights include proprietary technology and software relating to digital auction systems as well as trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property. Our increased reliance in recent years on proprietary Internet-based programs and technology have increased the relative importance of intellectual property assets to our business. Our business and IT systems and other key proprietary intellectual property generally are not protected by patents or registered design rights. As a result, we are particularly reliant on trademarks, copyright, database rights, registered domain names and the law protecting confidential information to protect our brands, technologies, software and databases. Although we have taken steps to reduce these risks, these steps may be inadequate. Effective intellectual property protection also may not be available in every country in which our services are offered, deployed or made available. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights or any inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we may be required to spend significant funds on monitoring and protecting our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to discover all infringements, misappropriations or other violations of our intellectual property. If we initiate litigation against infringements of our intellectual property, such litigation may prove costly and there is no guarantee that it will ultimately be successful and that the rulings we obtain will adequately remedy the damage we have suffered. In addition, we provide certain information to third-party service providers who help us assess the performance of our business (e.g., Google Analytics). Consequently, we only have limited control to ensure that such information is not misused by such service providers or passed on to third parties, including our competitors.",,,,N/A

Even unfounded allegations of infringement may adversely affect our reputation and business and may require significant resources to defend against. If we try to obtain licenses from such third parties to settle these disputes, there is no guarantee that such licenses will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, in which case we may be required to alter our brands and change the way we operate. Furthermore, some of the agreements we enter into with third parties may contain clauses regarding the protection of their intellectual property licensed to us. A violation of these clauses (e.g., the unauthorized sub-licensing or disclosure of a confidential source code) may require us to pay significant penalties, prevent us from utilizing such intellectual property in the future and result in litigation against us. In addition, some of our proprietary technology was developed on the basis of proprietary and non-proprietary software licensed from third parties. If these licenses were to be challenged or found invalid through litigation or other ----- proceedings, we may not be able to continue to utilize such proprietary technology.

We may face risks associated with unexpected changes in the regulatory environment, particularly in relation to complexity of domestic and international customs and tariffs, potentially adverse tax consequences, restrictions on foreign trade or investment, currency exchange and capital controls, nationalization and expropriation and cancelation of our contractual relationships without full compensation for loss. Any changes in the laws and regulations, applicable to our business and operations, including used vehicles in our inventory, as well as the Marketplace, or changes to the application and interpretation of such laws and regulations by authorities and courts, may adversely affect our operations (such as the supply of vehicles) or may give rise to substantial compliance costs, adjustment expenses and other costs as well as fines in connection with our business activities, or prevent us from executing our strategy as planned.

31,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,1.1.19,"Our failure to prevent unauthorized access to personal data or otherwise process personal data in accordance with applicable data protection laws could result in legal liability for, and reputational harm.","We process and store personal data as part of our business, including in relation to our employees, vendors and buyers. Strict data protection laws exist in both the UK and throughout continental Europe. These data protection laws require us to ensure an appropriate level of security of personal data, having regard to the possibility of damage to and the nature of the data. Failure to take appropriate information security measures could result in personal data being processed in an unauthorized or potentially unlawful manner. The General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (the “GDPR”) and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 significantly change the data protection landscape in the EU and the UK. Such laws and regulations strengthen the rights of individuals (data subjects), impose stricter controls over the processing of personal data by both controllers and processors of personal data and impose stricter sanctions with substantial administrative fines and potential claims for damages from data subjects for breach of their rights. The GDPR also offers data subjects the option to allow privacy organizations to litigate on their behalf, including collecting potential damages, which may result in a substantial increase in claims being brought. Should a serious data breach occur, the GDPR provides for increased obligations to notify regulators and data subjects whose personal data has been compromised and may result in the imposition of significant sanctions and penalties, which will require heightened escalation and notification processes with associated response plans. Complying with all relevant data protection laws and regulation is relatively complex. We, or the entities or businesses acquired by us, may have entered in the past or may enter in the future into employment agreements or other types of material contracts that may not be compliant with applicable data protection laws and regulations. Moreover, our customers frequently require that we demonstrate our compliance with data protection laws as they deem appropriate with respect to any personal data we may process on their behalf. Failure to demonstrate such compliance to their satisfaction may result in action including, but not limited to, the loss of contracts with such customers. The failure to comply with our obligations under applicable data protection laws could potentially result in us being issued with undertakings, enforcement notices (the failure with which to comply would be a criminal offence) and fines, as well as suffer damage to our brand and reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A

A failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions, liability to third parties, license revocation and reputational damage, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business as well as our profitability. Furthermore, if laws and regulations are not enforced equally against our competitors in a particular market, our compliance with laws and regulations may put us at a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis non-complying competitors. Changes in laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations applicable to us may also increase the costs of providing services or limit our ability to expand our service offerings, any of which could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. More stringent laws or regulations may impose additional burdens on us, and it is difficult to predict the impact of new or amended laws or regulations to which we may become subject. There is, and will likely continue to be, an increasing number of laws, regulations and court decisions pertaining to the Internet and online commerce, which may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the Internet. For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, local regulations impose restrictions on or prohibit credit and debit card operations in order to protect the privacy and security of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction. The growth and development of online commerce has also prompted calls for more stringent consumer protection laws and more aggressive enforcement efforts by regulatory authorities that may impose additional burdens on online businesses generally. Because of our relatively large physical property portfolio, we are also subject to the risk that we could be compelled by government authorities to sell or vacate the property on which we operate or to make significant changes to the operations and activities we undertake to comply with changes to planning regulations. Furthermore, because of our international operations, the various regulatory regimes to which we are subject may conflict so that compliance with the regulatory requirements in one jurisdiction may create regulatory issues in another, thereby making compliance more difficult and increasing the costs of conducting our business. In addition, if we were to expand into new countries, we could face legal, regulatory or tax requirements with which we are not familiar. Compliance with current or future laws and regulations to which we are subject could place significant demands on our resources, as well as subject us to unforeseen and potentially adverse legal, regulatory or tax consequences, which could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A

If relationships with our employees were to deteriorate, we could experience strikes, unionization efforts or other types of conflicts, which could lead to interruption to our operations and increased costs. In addition, payroll costs could increase because we compete with other service providers to recruit and retain skilled employees, which has become more challenging as a result of Brexit and the related restrictions on free movement of labor across the English Channel. High employment levels can lead to scarcity of staff and a corresponding increase in the wages and salaries necessary to attract and retain suitable employees may be indispensable in the future. In addition, future legislative changes relating to the minimum wage could necessitate an increase in payroll costs. We also undertake significant marketing activities, in particular for our Vehicle Buying division, and any increase in television, radio and Internet advertising rates could increase our operating expenses. Moreover, we incur significant fuel, power and other consumable supply costs across our operations that may escalate and there can be no assurance that our costs will not grow at a faster rate than our revenue. If we are unable to pass on future cost increases to our vendors or buyers, our operating profit margin could be adversely affected, which could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A
31,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,1.1.22,"We rely on the strength of our brands, and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness may increase.","Our brands, corporate image and reputation constitute a significant part of our value proposition. Our success over the years has largely depended on our ability to develop our brands and corporate image as a leading vehicle auction company in the UK and continental Europe. In addition, the WeBuyAnyCar consumer brand in the UK is particularly important to the Vehicle Buying division, and the development of the WeBuyAnyCar brand historically has required significant financial expenditure, particularly on marketing and advertising. ----- In order to maintain WeBuyAnyCar’s reputation, we have to be able to respond to changes in marketing and advertising rules, consumer sentiment and consumer preferences, all of which may change rapidly and as a result of factors outside of our control. Our brands could be adversely affected by the actions of other companies that damage the reputation of our industry as a whole, in particular in relation to the Vehicle Buying division, as several companies operate under names similar to WeBuyAnyCar’s name. As we seek to expand our operations, maintaining and increasing the awareness and perceived quality of our brands and corporate image will be important to attract and expand our vendor and buyer base. We use Internet search engines, in particular Google, to generate traffic to our websites. The purchase of keywords consists of anticipating words and terms consumers will use to search on Internet search engines and then bidding on those words and terms in the applicable search engine’s auction system. Search engines, including Google, frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a search, such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our websites can be adversely affected. Our positioning on a search engine’s search results depends on algorithms designed by the search engine provider and are based on various criteria including, in particular, the historical level of traffic on our websites. As a result, if search engine providers change their search algorithms in a manner that is competitively disadvantageous to us, our ability to generate traffic to our websites would be harmed. Furthermore, our mobile applications rely on app stores operated by third parties, in particular Apple, which make mobile applications available for download. The structure of these app stores may change and third-party operators may decide to exclude our mobile applications from their offering (e.g., if we do not agree to changes in terms and conditions), which may adversely affect the availability of our mobile applications. These operators may also charge us fees to list our mobile applications for download, which could adversely affect our margins or result in us discontinuing to offer our mobile applications through third-party app stores. We will continue to invest in, and devote resources to, advertising and marketing, as well as other efforts to preserve and enhance customer awareness of our brands. In particular, we expect to spend significant amounts on television, radio and Internet advertising to support WeBuyAnyCar, which is a purely customer brand. There can be no assurance, however, that our advertising campaigns will successfully maintain or enhance customer awareness of our brands. Advertising campaigns may be ineffective and may even have adverse effects on website traffic and brand perception as a result of factors potentially out of our control, such as changes in consumer preferences and regulatory reforms impacting advertising and marketing rules. Even if we are successful in our branding efforts, significant costs are incurred in order to develop, deploy and update our advertising campaigns, and as a result our efforts may not be cost-effective because, among others, assumptions regarding required customer acquisition costs and resulting revenue prove to be incorrect. In addition, we cannot guarantee that our current marketing channels will continue to be effective, permissible and generally available to us in the future. For television marketing, the program during which we broadcast our commercials may not achieve the anticipated number of viewers. For our online marketing, the relevant partners may be unable to deliver the anticipated traffic to our website and mobile applications. In particular, the popularity of social media channels tends to fluctuate, making it difficult to predict which channels are best suited to reach a mass audience. Moreover, any negative publicity may be accelerated through social media (e.g., Facebook, Instagram and Twitter) due to its immediacy and accessibility as a means of communication. Social media and websites immediately publish posts from users, often without filters or checks on the accuracy of the content posted. New and existing customers value readily available information concerning digital offerings and often act on such posts without further investigation or authentication. Allegations against us may be posted on social media, in Internet chat rooms or on blogs or websites by anyone on an anonymous basis. Any negative publicity, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents, or the failure to maintain or enhance customer awareness of our brands and generate demand in a cost-effective manner could damage our reputation, diminish the strength of our brands, undermine the trust and credibility we have established, have a negative impact on our ability to attract new or retain existing customers and require us to spend significant time and money to address such negative publicity.",,,,N/A
31,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,1.1.23,We may not be able to effectively communicate with our customers through email and other messages.,"We use newsletters (e.g., emails) as a free marketing tool to promote our digital and physical offering, website and mobile applications. Our emails may, however, be shown as “spam”or given a lower priority, which could reduce the likelihood of addresses opening or responding positively to them. Actions by third parties to block, impose restrictions on, or charge for the delivery of, emails and other messages, as well as legal or regulatory changes limiting our right to send such messages or imposing additional requirements, could impair our ability to communicate with customers. If we are not able to use unpaid marketing tools in the form of emails or other messages efficiently, this could impair our marketing efforts or make them more expensive if we have to increase spending on paid marketing channels. ----- Furthermore, malfunctions of our email and messaging services could result in erroneous messages being sent and customers no longer wanting to receive any messages from us. Furthermore, our process to obtain consent from visitors to our website and users of our mobile applications to receive newsletters and other messages from us and to allow us to use their data may be insufficient or invalid or become so as result of regulatory or legislative changes. As a result, such individuals or third parties may accuse us of sending unsolicited advertisements and other messages, which could result in claims or regulatory action being brought against us.",,,,N/A

The satisfaction of our customers depends in particular on the effectiveness of our customer service, in particular our ability to deal with complaints (e.g., with respect to the quality of used vehicles, technical problems, payment and shipping, defects and invoicing) in a timely and satisfying manner. Any unsatisfactory response or lack of responsiveness (e.g., due to interruptions of our hotlines) could reduce customer satisfaction and loyalty and therefore adversely affect our revenue and profitability.",,,,N/A
31,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,1.1.25,We are exposed to risks associated with currency fluctuations.,"We report our results in pound sterling, and pound sterling is also our functional currency. However, we conduct operations in the UK and continental Europe, as a result of which approximately 11% of our revenue in the fiscal year 2021 was denominated in currencies other than pound sterling, with the significant majority of this denominated in euro. Our results of operations may therefore be affected by both the transaction and translation effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when we incur costs or earn revenue in a currency other than the pound sterling. For example, because we report in pound sterling, our consolidated results would be adversely affected by the depreciation of the euro relative to the pound sterling, as this would result in reduced euro-denominated earnings, an effect which could increase were our European operations to expand, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to additional taxation as a result of any foreign exchange gain arising in respect of the interest on our euro-denominated indebtedness, which could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A
31,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,1.1.26,"Environmental, health and safety risks could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.","We operate from multiple locations across the UK and continental Europe. Large numbers of vehicles are stored and prepared for sale at these sites, and during that time releases of fuel, motor oil and other materials may occur. In addition, members of the public and our employees come into close contact with vehicles moving on or around our sites. Furthermore, our employed and contracted drivers collect and deliver large numbers of vehicles across both the UK and continental Europe and our fleet of vehicle transporters carries large numbers of vehicles annually. Consequently, our operations are subject to various environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the generation, treatment, storage and release of hazardous materials and wastes and the investigation and remediation of contamination, as well as regulations requiring adequate precautions to prevent injuries arising from collisions and impacts with vehicles moving within our locations and on public roads. For example, governments increasingly introduce low emission zones in certain geographical areas, where the most polluting vehicles are regulated and vehicles with higher emissions, including vehicles in support of the Automotive Services division, cannot enter, thereby limiting our operations. We may incur expenditures relating to accidents causing injury to individuals, releases of hazardous materials, investigative, remedial or corrective actions, claims by third parties and other environmental issues, and such expenditures, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Our failure to comply with current or future environmental, health or safety laws or to obtain and comply with permits required under such laws, could also subject us to significant liability or require costly investigative, remedial or corrective actions, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A
31,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,1.1.27,Failure to attract and retain skilled technical employees and management personnel could harm our business.,"Our success is in part driven by the skills, experience and efforts of our management team and by the efforts, ability and experience of key members of our management staff. The members of our senior management team have extensive experience in the industry in which we operate and have skills that are critical to the ----- operation of our business, including their relationships with, and understanding of the requirements of, the relevant regulatory authorities in the industry in which we operate. We have implemented policies and remuneration designed to retain and properly incentivize management; however, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to attract and retain qualified candidates to replace or succeed members of senior management, should the need arise. The loss of services of any of our management staff could significantly weaken our management expertise and our ability to deliver our services efficiently and effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Because we operate in a rapidly changing and increasingly digitalized market, our success also depends to a significant extent upon our ability to identify, attract, retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified technical personnel. Our employees have specialized knowledge that is in high demand, and competition for suitably qualified individuals with the relevant technical expertise in our industry and in the locations in which we operate is intense and may further increase as more vehicle auction companies in the UK and continental Europe shift their operating model towards an online business in response to the COVID 19 pandemic. We have a dedicated team of data scientists and have been able to utilize our data pool to develop highly accurate pricing capabilities based on age, mileage and condition, which permit us to maximize margins in real time. If we are unable to identify, attract, develop, motivate, adequately compensate and retain well-qualified and engaged personnel, or if existing highly skilled and specialized personnel leave us and successors or adequate replacements are not readily available, we may not be able to manage our operations effectively, which could cause us to suffer delays in new service offerings, experience difficulty complying with applicable requirements or otherwise fail to satisfy our customers’ demands, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The difficulties in identifying, attracting and retaining suitable management personnel and employees are exacerbated as a result of Brexit and free movement complications in relation thereto, which make travel between the UK and continental Europe more difficult. In addition, we bear the risk that our key management and key personnel becomes infected with COVID 19, and the measures adopted in response to the COVID 19 pandemic could make the integration of newly hired personnel more challenging.

31,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,1.1.28,We are subject to a substantial number of non-terminable long-term leases.,"We lease the majority of our properties, primarily comprising properties in the UK, pursuant to long-term leases. These leases do not include break clauses. As a result, if we ceased operations at properties which we could not subsequently sublet, we would continue to incur significant lease payments on these properties. In addition, as we continue to shift our operations towards a fully digital business model, we may be required to adapt the use of some or all of our properties. We may also decide to dispose of certain of our properties or may seek to terminate certain of our leases. Similarly, if and when business operations resume and return to pre-pandemic levels (see “—The COVID 19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a significant adverse _effect on our business, operations, financial condition, operating results and liquidity, and the ultimate outcome of the COVID 19 pandemic is uncertain”), we may also seek changes to our overall composition of portfolio of_ properties, or the related use thereof. Moreover, the current use of our properties may not necessarily be appropriate or cost efficient for future operations. However, there can be no guarantee that it will be legally permissible to change the use of our properties at such time or that we will be able to dispose of properties on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renegotiate long-term leases, especially if we were to seek the termination of a lease that does not include a break clause.",,,,N/A

Standardized terms and conditions have to comply with the statutory laws on general terms and conditions in the different jurisdictions in which we operate, which means that in many jurisdictions they are subject to intense scrutiny by the courts. The standard is even stricter if such terms and conditions are used vis-à-vis private consumers, such as in our WeBuyAnyCar business. If standardized documents, contracts, or terms and conditions we use contain provisions which are interpreted in a manner disadvantageous to us, or if any clauses are held to be invalid and thus replaced by statutory provisions which are disadvantageous to us, a large number of our contractual relationships could be affected. This could provide our counterparties with ----- unexpected legal rights and remedies (e.g., withdrawal rights), cause us to incur unexpected expenses and prevent us from operating our business as currently operated. In some cases, courts may even determine that our standardized terms and conditions are generally invalid, and as a result we may not have entered into a valid contractual relationship with the relevant counterparty.",,,,N/A
31,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,1.1.30,"We have several defined contribution pension schemes in certain continental European countries as well as two defined benefit pension plans in the UK, some of which are in deficit.","We participate in several defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and certain continental European countries as well as two defined benefit pension plans in the UK. Our cash funding obligations are set in accordance with applicable pension legislation, assessed on a triennial basis and required to be agreed between us and independent trustees. Our cash funding obligations are further subject to increases in life expectancy. Our total contribution to these defined contribution schemes in the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021 was £6.4 million. We cannot guarantee that our future cash contributions will not undermine our capacity to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes. In addition, the two defined benefit pension plans in the UK are in deficit. As of March 28, 2021, the two defined benefit pension plans in the UK had a deficit of £12.4 million (2020: £15.1 million). Plan liabilities, in respect of defined benefit obligations, are calculated on a discounted basis using a discount rate which is set with reference to corporate bond yields. If the plan assets underperform such yield, then this will create a deficit. The trustees of each plan, and their advisors, carry out regular reviews of asset allocations within each plan and consider the need to switch assets in line with the investment strategies. However, the plans hold only a portion of assets as defensive assets (government and corporate bonds) and we cannot guarantee that the level of investment risk is reduced appropriately as the maturity approaches for each plan. Moreover, while we have contractual caps on the level of inflationary increases to be applied to pension obligations in order to protect the plans from extreme inflation, our pension liabilities in deferment are linked and subject to inflation. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that an increase in inflation will not lead to an increase in our pension deficit. Furthermore, plan assets are likely to decrease following an increase in the interest rate. This is due to an increase in interest rates having the effect of a decrease in value of the defensive assets held by the plans. While such risk is partially mitigated by the measurement of plan liabilities being linked to bond yields, any decrease in interest rates has the effect of decreasing bond yields, which in turn increases plan liabilities. Accordingly, the materialization of any of these risks, if significant, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A

In addition, we have included certain non-IFRS measures, including Reported Adjusted EBITDA, IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA, IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA, IAS 17 Pro Forma Adjusted Run Rate EBITDA, Underlying Cash CAPEX, Adjusted Operating Cash Flow, Adjusted Cash Conversion, COVID Adjusted Operating Cash Flow and COVID Adjusted Cash Conversion. The non-IFRS measures and other information (including unaudited adjusted data) included in this Offering Memorandum have been prepared for information purposes only and have not ----- been prepared in accordance with IFRS, U.S. GAAP or any other internationally accepted accounting principles or audited or reviewed in accordance with any applicable auditing standards. These non-IFRS measures and other information are not identified as accounting measures under IFRS and therefore should not be considered as alternative measures to evaluate our performance. The non-IFRS measures and other information (including unaudited adjusted data) are based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable in the circumstances. However, these assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain, subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and other risks and may differ materially from our actual financial condition or results of operations. The non-IFRS measures and other information (including unaudited adjusted data) included in this Offering Memorandum are not intended to comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC and will not be subject to review by the SEC and certain measures would be prohibited from inclusion in documents furnished or filed with the SEC. Certain of these amounts have not been, and, in certain cases cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. We have also included certain unaudited financial information prepared in accordance with IAS 17 (Leases), which is an accounting standard that was superseded by IFRS 16. Such unaudited financial information has important limitations; in particular, it is prepared in accordance with a historic accounting standard, IAS 17 (Leases), and has not been audited. As such, it is not comparable to the audited results due to adjustments and should not be regarded as a substitute for the Consolidated Financial Statements or financial data prepared in accordance with IFRS. Moreover, some of the financial information included in this Offering Memorandum is adjusted for the estimated impact of COVID 19 and/or for certain run rate adjustments based on our most recent three months of trading. In particular, IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA and ratios derived therefrom seek to adjust IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA for the impact of COVID 19. The adjustments made to calculate IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA are based upon available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in the circumstances but are included for illustrative purposes only and have not been audited. IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA is not comparable to the audited results and should not be regarded as a substitute for the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are prepared in accordance with IFRS. The adjustments relating to COVID 19 are calculated by replacing the results of operations for COVID-impacted periods with prior non-COVID impacted periods, thereby presenting the results of operations during a more normalized period of trading. For the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021, the adjustments relating to COVID 19 are calculated by replacing the results of operations for January 2021 (£4.5 million) and February 2021 (£13.2 million) with the results of operations for January 2020 (£15.9 million) and February 2020 (£21.1 million), respectively, thereby presenting the results of operations during a more normalized period of trading. For the 52-week period ended March 28, 2021, the adjustments relating to COVID 19 are calculated by replacing the results of operations for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2021 (£2.0 million) and the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2021 (£43.9 million) with the results of operations for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2020 (£44.5 million) and the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2020 (£66.2 million), respectively, thereby presenting the results of operations during a more normalized period of trading. For the unaudited aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020, the adjustments relating to COVID 19 are calculated by adding back an amount of £11.3 million (based on management forecasts using operating results for March 2020 immediately prior to lockdowns, reflecting restrictions on operating activities due to COVID 19) and an amount of £2.7 million (representing provisions relating to bad debt and inventory). Such information and adjustments are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to project our consolidated results of operations for any future period. Such information has not been audited, reviewed or verified and you should not place undue reliance thereon. Moreover, IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA is included for, among other periods, the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021. IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA for the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021 is calculated on the basis of IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA for the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021 and adding adjustments relating to COVID 19 which are calculated by replacing the results of operations for January 2021 (£4.5 million) and February 2021 (£13.2 million) with the results of operations for January 2020 (£15.9 million) and February 2020 (£21.1 million), respectively. Financial information for the 53-week period ended May 30, 2021 is based on management accounts and is included for illustrative purposes only, has not been reviewed or audited and may not be reflective of the actual results for such periods and should not be regarded as a substitute for the audited consolidated financial data of the Parent or financial data prepared in accordance with IFRS. We have also included 52-week IAS 17 Pro Forma Adjusted Run Rate EBITDA as of May 30, 2021. IAS 17 Pro Forma Adjusted Run Rate EBITDA is calculated on the basis of IAS 17 COVID Adjusted EBITDA for ----- the aggregated 52-week period ended March 29, 2020 and applying additional adjustments to give effect increases in profitability and volume in our UK Vehicle Remarketing division, the our International Vehicle Remarketing division and our Vehicle Buying division, as well as the decrease in IAS 17 Adjusted EBITDA for our Automotive Services division, in the period from February 22, 2021 to May 30, 2021. IAS 17 Pro Forma Adjusted Run Rate EBITDA is included for illustrative purposes only and, as a run rate calculation giving full year effect to the most recent three month period, is likely to differ from actual results for the period. In particular, this run rate calculation does not give effect to seasonal variances or any impact of changes in longer term demand dynamics. See “Summary Financial Information—Non-IFRS Measures,” “Operating and Financial Review—COVID 19” and “Operating and Financial Review—Seasonality.” In addition, we have included certain unaudited aggregated financial information for the 52-week period ended March 29, 2020. The unaudited aggregated financial information is derived by adding together the unaudited consolidated income statement information of BCA Marketplace for the 219-day period from and including April 1, 2019 to and including November 5, 2019 and the consolidated income statement information of the Parent for the 42-week period from and including June 10, 2019 to and including March 29, 2020 (which includes the 145-day post-CA Acquisition trading result from November 6, 2019 up to and including March 29, 2020). The financial information used in presenting such information includes information for the Parent from June 10, 2019 (the date of incorporation of the Parent), which overlaps with information of BCA Marketplace from April 1, 2019. However, the Parent was formed on June 10, 2019 for the purposes of facilitating the CA Acquisition, which was consummated on November 6, 2019 and the Parent did not trade prior to November 6, 2019. Moreover, while both the Fiscal Year 2020 Consolidated Financial Statements and the 2020 Predecessor Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, they relate to different entities that have not prepared their financial information on a consistent basis. Such unaudited aggregated financial information is included for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what our income statement would have been if the CA Acquisition had occurred on April 1, 2019 and is not intended to project our consolidated results of operations for any future period. The foregoing financial data has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act or any generally accepted accounting standards. None of the adjustments, estimates or run rate calculations have been audited by any independent auditors and should not be considered indicative of actual results that would have been achieved had the events for which we have made the adjustment, estimate or calculation been completed as the dates stated and do not purport to indicate our future consolidated results of operations or financial position.

Borrowings under the Second Lien Facility Agreement will bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to SONIA, subject to a zero floor, plus an agreed margin. SONIA, EURIBOR and LIBOR could rise significantly in the future. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these benchmark interest rates in the future, there can be no assurances that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense associated with the debt under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement, to the extent not fixed by means of hedging arrangements, would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. As a consequence of regulatory reforms, the common maturities of U.S. dollar LIBOR will cease to be published as panel bank rates after June 30, 2023 (and all other LIBOR settings for all currencies will cease as panel bank rates after December 31, 2021). It is not known if or when regulatory reform may, in the future, cause EURIBOR to cease or be replaced. The U.S. dollar floating rate market is currently expected to transition to use, in place of U.S. dollar LIBOR, a floating rate equal to compounding overnight Secured Overnight Financing Rate published by the Federal Reserve in the United States plus a spread adjustment, by not later than the time that the relevant U.S. dollar LIBOR setting is to cease as a panel bank rate, although other alternative rates may also be used. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our debt linked to such a benchmark. Regulatory requirements under the EU Benchmark Regulation (particularly in relation to EURIBOR) and under the UK Benchmark Regulation (particularly in relation to LIBOR) may: (i) discourage market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to a regulated benchmark (such as EURIBOR or LIBOR); (ii) trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used for the benchmark; or (iii) lead to the disappearance of the benchmark. The scheduled cessation of the LIBOR benchmark as a panel bank rate or any proposal to cease the determination or publication of any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which the relevant benchmark is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark. Any of the above changes or any other consequential changes as a result of international, national or other proposals for reform or other initiatives may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in any affected benchmark, which could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any floating rate debt linked to such benchmark and on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. -----",,,,N/A

Unless a company is a Guarantor, such company will not have any obligation to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Generally, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under our finance facilities and bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder. Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction: - the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and - creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary. As such, the Notes and each Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of non-Guarantor subsidiaries.",,,,N/A

Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control.,"Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, and to fund working capital and capital expenditures, will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends, to some extent, on the success of our business strategy and on general economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and other factors, as well as the other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are beyond our control. This also depends on our cash flow cycle. If our interest payment dates coincide with periods of significant cash outflow, we may have insufficient cash to pay our obligations as they come due. We also experience seasonal fluctuations in our cash flow. Due to seasonal trends influencing both vehicle supply and demand, our revenue and operating results have varied, and likely will continue to vary, from quarter to quarter. For example, used vehicle sales in the UK tend to increase during vehicle registration plate change periods in March and September of each year. In March, in particular, new vehicle sales traditionally peak in the UK, and as a result, dealer vendors of the Vehicle Remarketing division typically experience an increase in part-exchange volumes, which has a subsequent effect of increasing ----- sales through the Marketplace. Conversely, our revenue typically decreases during the summer and in December, a seasonality pattern that is followed by sales in both the Vehicle Buying division and the Automotive Services division. Seasonality can therefore have a negative effect on our cash flow, thereby impacting our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, including the Notes, and to fund working capital and capital expenditures. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities, that revenue growth and operating improvements will be realized or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. In particular, the continuing economic disruption caused by the COVID 19 pandemic, and the resulting restrictions and preventive measures, have adversely affected our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities. See “—Risks Relating to Our Business—The _COVID 19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a significant adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, operating results and liquidity, and the ultimate outcome of the COVID 19 pandemic is uncertain” and “Operating and Financial Review—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”_ If our future cash flows from operating activities and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures; - sell assets; - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Indenture and the terms governing the Senior Term Loan Facility, the Second Lien Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility, and any future debt, may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and could require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that any assets which we could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable.",,,,N/A

The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. All of these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. For the restrictions that are included in the Indenture, see “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants.”For the restrictions that are included in the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement, ----- see “Description of Other Financial Arrangements.” A breach of covenants, ratios, tests or restrictions contained in these agreements could result in an event of default under these agreements. In particular, upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement, subject to any applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the relevant facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the relevant facilities, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, any default under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or crossacceleration provisions, including the Indenture. If our creditors accelerate payment of amounts under the relevant facilities, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts. We are also subject to the affirmative covenants contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement. In particular, we are required to comply with a financial covenant to maintain our consolidated senior secured leverage ratio for each period of twelve months ending on any financial quarter date (the first such financial quarter ending April 3, 2022) if utilizations thereunder exceed a certain threshold. See “Description of Other Financial _Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement.” Our ability to meet these covenants and restrictions can be_ affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet them. In addition, we are subject to certain covenants contained in the Receivables Facility Agreement, including with respect to financial covenants requiring us to meet certain EBITDA (as such term is defined in the Receivables Facility Agreement) thresholds. Our ability to satisfy the financial condition in the Receivables Facility Agreement may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy such requirements. We are also subject to general undertakings contained in the Receivables Facility Agreement restricting our ability to, among others, merge with other business entities, enter into certain types of joint ventures, change our business focus, dispose of certain assets or pay dividends, in each case subject to exceptions and qualifications.",,,,N/A

As soon as reasonably practicable after the Issue Date and in any event within two business days from the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the operation of the Agreed Security Principles, certain perfection requirements, any Permitted Collateral Liens and certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws, by the Post-Closing Collateral. There can be no assurance that collateral in respect of the Existing Facilities will be released on the Issue Date and that we will be successful in procuring the Post-Closing Collateral within the time period specified, the failure of which would result in an event of default under the Indenture. In addition to the Notes, the Collateral will also secure borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility, the Second Lien Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of the Notes—Security.” Furthermore, the Additional Guarantors are only required to guarantee the Notes within two business days of the Issue Date. Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security, as applicable. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims under the Notes, if we fail or are unable to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens. We may not be able to perfect any such security interests. Any issues that we are unable to resolve in connection with the delivery and recordation of such security interests may negatively impact the value of the Collateral. Perfection of the security interests in the Collateral, especially the Post-Closing Collateral, after the Issue Date increases the risk that the liens granted by those security interests become avoided or subject to the liens of intervening creditors or intervening or existing liens. Any failure to perfect any security interest in the Collateral may also result in the invalidity or the lack of effectiveness of the relevant security interest or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties, including a ----- trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral.

See “Description of the Notes—Security—The Collateral.” There is no guarantee that the value of the Collateral will be sufficient to enable the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes. There is no requirement to provide funds to enhance the value of the Collateral if it is insufficient. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with respect to the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes. The amount of proceeds realized upon the enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral or in the event of liquidation will depend upon many factors, including, among others, general market and economic conditions, the condition of the market for the Collateral, the ability to sell Collateral in an orderly sale, the fair market value of the Collateral, the timing and manner of the sale, whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the jurisdiction in which the enforcement action or sale is completed, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral, the availability of buyers and the condition of the Collateral and exchange rates. Further, there may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy a significant portion of its assets in the event of an enforcement action. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. Portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may not have a readily ascertainable market value or may not be saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in its disposal. To the extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned by the Issuer or the Guarantors, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent, the Trustee or holders of the Notes to realize or enforce that Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the Intercreditor Agreement could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Collateral could be sold in a timely manner, or at all. Proceeds from enforcement sales of capital stock and assets that are part of the Collateral must be applied to repay on a pari passu basis the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantor under the Indenture and the Notes as well as borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility, the Second Lien Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations, if any, and any other indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors permitted to be incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, the Indenture allows incurrence of certain additional permitted debt in the future that is secured by the Collateral on a priority or pari passu basis. The incurrence of any additional debt secured by the Collateral would reduce amounts payable to you from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral. To the extent that other first-priority security interests, pre-existing liens, liens permitted under the Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement and other rights encumber the Collateral securing the Notes, the parties may have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral.",,,,N/A

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. In addition, the laws, regulations or other governmental measures introduced in response ----- to the COVID 19 pandemic may have the effect of imposing a moratorium on or otherwise delaying or limiting the ability to enforce or pursue certain remedies in respect of the Collateral. The security interests of the Security Agent are subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests such as the Collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. In addition, the Security Agent, on behalf of the holders of the Notes, may have difficulty enforcing or be entirely unable to enforce rights in the Collateral in competition with third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in, and/or priority with respect to, the same Collateral.

The applicable hardening periods for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or perfected were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and it may not be possible to enforce such security interest.

See “Certain Insolvency and Local Law _Limitations.”_ ----- Enforcement of any of the Guarantees against any Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, these laws and defenses generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its Guarantee depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of any Guarantee against any Guarantor. In addition, the laws, regulations or other governmental measures introduced in response to the COVID 19 pandemic may have the effect of imposing a moratorium on or otherwise delaying or limiting the ability to enforce or pursue certain remedies in respect of the Guarantees. Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that: - the relevant Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee; - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for the relevant Guarantee and the Guarantor was (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee, (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Guarantee or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; - the relevant Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor; or - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law.

The liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, improper corporate distribution on other grounds or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.

If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain third-party financing to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition or make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.” Further, if pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes, the Indenture will permit the Issuer, at its option, to redeem the remaining outstanding Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. As a consequence, holders of the Notes may be required to surrender the Notes against their will at a price equivalent to that paid to tendering holders and may not receive the return expected. The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a Change of Control (as defined under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control”). Additionally, there are certain exceptions to the definition of “Change of Control”which allow changes in the ownership of the Issuer if certain conditions are satisfied, including if a specified consolidated total net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such Change of Control on one occasion. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of _Control,” the Indenture does not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or_ redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. In the event the Parent is sold to a new investor, whether or not such sale constitutes a change of control under the Indenture, no assurance can be given that any such investor will continue to implement our current business and financial strategy. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the _Notes—Certain Definitions—Specified Change of Control Event.”_ The definition of “Change of Control”in the Indenture includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Parent and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of all or substantially all of the Parent’s and its restricted subsidiaries’ assets, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.",,,,N/A

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among others, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices.

36,Final Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to Our Business,1.1.1,"Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had, and any possible future outbreaks could have, an adverse effect on us. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the reactions of governmental and other authorities to contain, mitigate or combat the pandemic, have severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world, have impacted, and are expected to continue to impact, our operations, and the nature, extent and duration of the impact of COVID-19 or any future disease or adverse health condition is highly uncertain and beyond our control. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the governments of many countries have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing lockdowns, curtailing travel, closure of schools, prohibitions of mass gatherings, mandatory remote working, and in some countries, the ability to access manufacturing facilities and office buildings. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused significant economic dislocation in many of the countries in which we operate and sell our products, which has resulted in an unprecedented slow-down in economic activity and a related increase in unemployment. Were a recession to occur, we cannot predict the length of such recession or the short- and long-term impact it may have on the global economy or our business specifically. Resurgences or further outbreaks of COVID-19 are also likely to occur. We cannot predict when or where any further outbreaks may occur, their duration, how far into the future we may experience outbreaks nor can we predict with any certainty the impacts of such subsequent outbreaks, including the impacts of future national or local lockdowns or other measures implemented by national and/or local authorities. As of April 2021, COVID-19 outbreaks were significantly affecting many countries, including Germany and other countries in which we operate, with cases rising markedly and with new, more contagious strains of the virus emerging. Any or all such consequences may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a response to COVID-19, we initiated a shutdown of production at four of our production sites, Görlitz, Strödt, Bernstadt and Steinau-Ürzell beginning in April 2020. While production resumed at three of our sites in late May or early June of 2020, the downtime at the Steinau-Ürzell site continued until September 2020. The production shutdown resulted in unplanned idle costs of €16.7 million (excluding idle costs assumed in budget or outside the shutdown period). In the three months ended December 31, 2020, we significantly ramped up production to replenish depleted inventory levels. The average cost per unit increased significantly compared to normal levels in the period that our production sites were closed. We also incurred additional costs associated with stocking raw materials in March 2020 in anticipation of delays and supply chain disruptions. While we continue to monitor the situation, we do not currently envisage further disruption to our supply chain and distribution channels, and believe our inventory levels are sufficient; however, any future mandatory shutdowns, reductions in operations or other restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, all of our retail stores in Europe, America and Asia have been closed at times, resulting in a significant decrease in our revenues from our Retail channel. Due 31 ----- to local government mandated “stay-at-home” orders, on March 29, 2020, we shut our two retail locations in the United States and laid off the retail staff. We also laid off certain corporate staff. We received short-time working (Kurzarbeit) compensation from the German government’s employment agency (KUG) in the amount of €6.1 million for FY 2020. Such payments are subject to a final review (Vorbehalt der Nachprüfung) of the conditions for the payments by the Federal Labor Agency. While we believe we are in compliance with these requirements, this payroll relief could be clawed back by the government in the event that these eligibility criteria are not met. In addition, even though our locations in Europe were able to reopen, we have had to close again our retail stores in certain locations as governments reintroduced lockdown measures, and we cannot predict how long such lockdown measures will last or, if lifted, if they could be reintroduced in the future. Many of our wholesale customers have also closed at times, with some rescheduling orders, resulting in deferred wholesale revenues (including distributor revenue) and requiring a build-up of inventory in order to mitigate any disruptions in our distribution channels. Despite proactive measures by us to address COVID-19 and the significant increase in revenues from our e-commerce channels during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenues in our retail was adversely affected. In the three months ended December 31, 2020, our retail sales declined by 26.0% compared to the three months ended December 31, 2019, respectively. As a precautionary matter, we also collected deposits from certain wholesale partners for potential defaults due to the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily related to our U.S. operations. Any further outbreaks of COVID-19 and related measures to contain such outbreaks could impact existing orders from customers and our ability to fulfill such orders. Although we have implemented measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including disinfecting production sites and offices, purchasing face masks for our employees, actively tracking any confirmed cases of COVID-19 and performing root cause analysis, and inviting regulators to our sites to review safety protocol, these measures may not fully mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, or adequately protect against any outbreaks of COVID-19 at our production facilities. We have also incurred certain costs in connection with implementing these measures and with hiring replacement workers following the reopening of our production facilities. We have also taken steps to ensure that our manufacturing partners in Portugal are adequately protecting employees at their production sites and have performed COVID-19 audits on certain of our logistics partners, but may still be subject to business or reputation risks if such measures are inadequate. We cannot, however, predict the degree to, or the period over, which we will be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to continue implementing such measures. Given evolving government policies and the emergence of new variants of COVID-19 in several countries where we operate, and despite the development of a vaccine, there may be further impacts on the economies or the consumer purchasing power of the countries where we operate. Any of the foregoing including any resulting deterioration in general economic conditions or change in consumer behavior, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition results of operations and prospects. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk _Factors” section.

For example, our products can be actively or mistakenly presented in a specific context not related to our brand (e.g., ethically, religiously, politically); we could experience customer dissatisfaction through our customer services in the direct to consumer or business to business segment; we could have issues relating to not properly maintained and monitored relationships with suppliers with respect to quality of products or conditions of the business of our suppliers; and we could receive negative publicity, including inaccurate adverse information, from our business partners, competitors or employees. Our brand value also depends on our ability to maintain a positive consumer perception of our corporate integrity and culture, including with regard to the sustainability of our products. Negative claims or publicity 32 ----- involving us or our products, or the production methods of any of our suppliers or the materials we source, could seriously damage our reputation and brand image, regardless of whether such claims or publicity are accurate. In addition, we have been increasing our online presence through our expanding e-commerce channel. Our social media presence amplifies consumer engagement with the Birkenstock brand but comes with less control due to consumer comments and hashtags compared to more traditional public relations and marketing methods, which could associate the brand with content which is not aligned with our values. Social media influencers or other endorsers of our products could engage in behavior that reflects poorly on our brand and may be attributed to us or otherwise adversely affect us. Further, our brand reputation could be harmed if it became associated with negative media, for example, if we or our senior executives may from time to time take positions on social issues that may be unpopular with some customers or potential customers, which may impact our ability to attract or retain such customers. Our brand reputation could also be harmed if we experience a cyber-attack or loss of consumer data. Adverse publicity could undermine consumer confidence in the Birkenstock brand and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if such publicity is unfounded. Any failure to maintain favorable brand recognition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Therefore, we rely on our ability to work together with third parties in our wholesale sales channel, including wholesale customers and distributors, to ensure that our products are sold in environments and in a manner consistent with our brand image. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, sales through third-party channels accounted for 68.2% of our sales. Actions by these third-party distribution channels that vary from our policies, such as presenting our products in a manner inconsistent with our preferred positioning or offering our products alongside “lookalike” products, could damage our brand and reputation. If our third-party sales channels do not maintain the standards of quality, brand positioning and exclusivity we require, or if they otherwise misuse the Birkenstock brand, there is a risk that our reputation and the integrity of the brand may be damaged. This may in turn lead to a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",,,,N/A

For example, we are currently in the process of transforming our global distribution strategy, from cooperating with distributors to operating through owned individual offices and local entities, with a view to having further distribution control as well as driving revenue. The implementation of our transformation strategy presents a number of significant risks, including: - actual or perceived disruption of service or reduction in service levels to customers and consumers; - actual or perceived disruption to suppliers, distribution networks and other important operational relationships and the inability to resolve potential conflicts in a timely manner; - difficulty in obtaining timely delivery of products of acceptable quality from suppliers; - diversion of management attention from ongoing business activities and strategic objectives; - disruption to our culture; - failure to maintain employee morale and retain key employees; and - actual or threatened claims and law suits from current and/or former distributors. As our agreements with distributors are long term and typically require 18-24 months’ notice prior to termination, any changes to our distribution channels require advanced planning to implement and lead times 33 ----- may vary. Furthermore, if we experience adverse changes to our business, additional restructuring or reorganization activities may be required in the future. Due to these and other factors, we cannot predict whether we will fully realize the purpose and anticipated benefits or cost savings of any restructuring, productivity or efficiency initiatives and, if we do not, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",,,,N/A
36,Final Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to Our Business,1.1.5,Our business is influenced by economic conditions that impact consumer spending and our operations.,"Our business is influenced by economic conditions that impact consumer spending. Many factors affect the level of consumer spending on our products, including the state of the economy as a whole, stock market performance, interest rates, currency exchange rates, recession, inflation, deflation, political uncertainty, the availability of consumer credit, taxation, unemployment and other matters that influence consumer confidence. For example, discretionary spending generally declines during periods of economic uncertainty. In a prolonged economic downturn, we may experience declining sales as a result of general reduced consumer spending. These trends also affect the business of our wholesale customers, which in turn has an adverse impact on our revenues from these distribution channels. Since early 2020, the primary factor in increased uncertainty globally from an economic and social perspective has been the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted, and may continue to result, in materially increased volatility and declines in financial markets and weaker demand in the global economy. Measures implemented, or intended to be implemented, by governments or governmental bodies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on supply chains resulting, for instance, in plant closures or increases in the cost of raw materials, and generally impact business operations across the economy both as a result of weakened economic activity and the employees being affected. See “—Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely _affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.” Furthermore, global economic conditions have been, and are likely to_ continue to be, affected by concerns over increased geopolitical tensions as well as political developments, such as the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union (“Brexit”) on January 31, 2020, and the threat of escalated trade disputes on a global level. See also “—Uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom’s _withdrawal from the European Union could have a material adverse effect on our business.”_ It is difficult to predict how economic conditions will develop, as they are impacted by macro movements of the financial markets and many other factors, including the stock, bond and derivatives markets as well as measures taken by various governmental and regulatory authorities and central banks. Uncertainty remains in the global markets and the global economy could experience another recession, or a depression, which could be more prolonged or have a greater financial impact than the global recessions that began in 2008. Any downturns in general economic conditions that impact consumer spending, particularly in the countries where we sell a significant portion of our products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",,,,N/A

Competitive factors that affect our market position include our ability to predict and respond to changing consumer preferences and tastes in a timely manner, continuing to market and develop new products that appeal to consumers, our ability to accurately predict customer demand and ensure product availability, the strength and recognition of the Birkenstock brand, pricing our products competitively, managing the impact of the rapidly changing retail environment and the expansion of our online presence, and our marketing, advertising and distribution efforts. Our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, more developed consumer and customer bases, more comprehensive product lines and greater distribution capabilities, and may spend substantially more on product advertising and endorsements. Our competitors may also own more recognized brands, implement more effective marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, make more attractive offers to potential employees and distribution partners, have a larger online presence or respond more quickly to changes in consumer preferences. Some of our competitors may be better able to take advantage of market opportunities and withstand market downturns better than we can. For example, we face competition from established competitors in the ASPA and MEAI hubs, where we are a relatively new market entrant. Additionally, the general availability of offshore footwear manufacturing capacity allows for rapid expansion by competitors and 34 ----- new entrants in the footwear market. We may be unable to compete successfully in the future, and increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of market share and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand our development, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",,,,N/A
36,Final Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to Our Business,1.1.7,"If we encounter operational challenges relating to the distribution of our products, our business could be adversely affected","We rely on both our own and third-party logistics centers to warehouse and ship products to our wholesale channel, retail stores and e-commerce consumers throughout the world. These centers are subject to operational risks, including, among other things, mechanical and IT system failure, work stoppages, increases in transportation costs, and the impact of pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), cross border trade barriers (including as a result of Brexit), natural disasters, political crises, civil unrest and other catastrophic events. Such disruption could have an adverse effect on the availability of our in-store and warehoused inventory and would divert financial and management resources from beneficial uses. In addition, distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the transportation of products to and from their distribution facilities. If we encounter problems with our distribution systems, whether our own or third-party, our ability to meet customer and consumer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be adversely affected. Additionally, the success of our e-commerce channel and the satisfaction of consumers depend on their timely receipt of products. The efficient flow of our products requires that our own and third-party operated distribution facilities have adequate capacity to support the current level of e-commerce channel and any anticipated increased levels that may follow from the planned growth of that channel. To the extent that any of these risks were to materialize, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to consumers and experience dissatisfaction from consumers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, we use independent distributors to sell our products in many of our markets. Failure by our distributors to meet planned annual sales goals or to make timely payments on amounts owed to us due to, for example, economic difficulties faced by such distributors could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position, and it may be difficult and costly to locate an acceptable substitute distributor. If a change in distributor becomes necessary, we may experience increased costs, as well as substantial disruption and a resulting loss of sales and brand equity in the market where such distributor operates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",,,,N/A

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, our wholesale channel accounted for 68.2% of our revenues, with our top ten wholesale partners accounting for 16.7% of our revenues for the same period. While our agreements with our wholesale partners generally run indefinitely as a form of framework agreement, purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis. If any major wholesale partner decreases or ceases purchasing from us, cancels its orders, reduces the floor space, assortments, fixtures or advertising for our products or changes the manner of doing business with us for any reason, such actions could adversely affect our business. In addition, a decline in the performance or financial condition of a major wholesale partner, including bankruptcy or liquidation, could result in a material loss of revenues to us and cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer, require us to assume more credit risk relating to our receivables from that customer or limit our ability to collect amounts related to previous purchases by that customer. As a precautionary matter in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have requested certain wholesale partners pay deposits for their orders. These measures and other measures we may adopt to mitigate credit risk, however, may not be successful. In addition, retail consolidation could lead to fewer wholesale partners, wholesale partners seeking more favorable price, payment or other terms from us and a decrease in the number of stores that carry our products. While we seek to insure credit risk, there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to obtain credit risk insurance at commercially attractive terms or at all.

While we have implemented internal measures to comply with applicable customs regulations and to properly calculate the import duties applicable to imported products, customs authorities may disagree with our claimed tariff treatment for certain products, resulting in unexpected costs that may not have been factored into the sales price of such products and our expected margins. In addition, we cannot predict whether future domestic and foreign laws, regulations, or specific or broad trade remedy actions, or international agreements may impose additional duties or other restrictions on the importation of products from one or more of our sourcing venues. Any such changes in legislation and government policy may have a material adverse effect on our business, including the imposition of tariffs on certain materials which could increase our product costs. For example, in recent periods, the US government has announced various import tariffs on goods imported from certain trade partners, such as the European Union and China, which have resulted and may continue to result in reciprocal tariffs on goods exported from the United States to such trade partners. Trade barriers and other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements around the world have the potential to decrease demand for our products, negatively impact suppliers and adversely impact the economies in which we operate. Trade barriers and other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements could increase the cost of raw materials and components used in certain of our products, which could in turn increase our cost of goods sold, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",,,,N/A

The cost of services and materials is subject to change based on availability and market conditions that are difficult to predict. Various conditions, such as diseases affecting the availability of leather, affect the cost of the footwear marketed by us. In addition, fuel prices and numerous other factors, such as the possibility of service interruptions at shipping and receiving ports, affect our shipping costs. Most of our raw materials are natural products or have major natural ingredients (e.g., leather, cork, jute, latex). However, only very few are actually traded as commodities (e.g., steel, latex). We use certain indices as references for price developments, and factors such as weather and climate conditions, demand of competing industries (e.g., leather for car manufacturers, furniture) and general economic factors such as supply and demand and raw material price developments will affect the cost of our materials. We source components and other raw materials (including leather, ethylene-vinyl acetate (“EVA”), cork, adhesives, natural latex, jute, copper, wool felt and brass buckles) from over 140 suppliers located mainly in Europe, but also in Turkey, the Americas and Asia. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, our top 14 suppliers accounted for approximately 60% of our supply costs of raw materials, semi-finished goods, auxiliary and packing. Generally, we aim to source our materials from multiple suppliers and have policies to prevent dependence on any single supplier. However, for certain materials, we may rely on specific suppliers that are able to meet the level of quality and supply we require. For example, although our leathers are sourced from different tanneries, our requirement for materials of high quality may result in reducing the pool of available tanneries that can meet such requirements. In addition, some of our products use materials of high technical complexity and high-quality standards, such as EVA granules, or that require specific IP rights, such as the EVA buckles. We also have some regional dependencies. For example, while we do have multiple cork suppliers, they are all based in Portugal, thus creating a specific geographical dependency, and we have similar regional dependencies for other of our raw materials. Our relationships with suppliers are either based on individual purchase orders, on purchase orders governed by a framework agreement, or on separate agreements governing the conditions for the supply of specific materials. Although our contracts with these suppliers contain provisions that ensure the supplier is not able to terminate the contract on short notice, should one or more of these suppliers be unable to supply or decide to cease supplying us with raw materials and components, or decide to increase prices significantly due to price increases, shortages or for other reasons that may be beyond our control, we may be unable to identify alternative suppliers of such materials at a reasonable cost or at all and, in any event, it may 36 ----- take a significant period of time to receive any materials from alternative suppliers. Moreover, if we expand beyond the production capacity of our current suppliers as we continue to grow, we may not be able to find new suppliers with an appropriate level of expertise and capacity in a timely manner. Our supply chain could also be materially adversely affected by a number of other factors, including, among other things, potential economic and political instability in countries where our suppliers are located, increases in shipping or other transportation costs, manufacturing and transportation delays and interruptions, whether as a result of natural disasters or force majeure events (including without limitation unrest, civil disorder, war, terrorist attacks, subversive activities or sabotage, fires, floods, explosions, other catastrophes, epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic), industrial action in the supply chain or other factors, supplier compliance with applicable laws and regulations, adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and changes in laws affecting the importation and taxation of goods, including duties, tariffs and quotas, or changes in the enforcement of those laws. We may also be subject to potential reputational damage if one or more of our suppliers violates or is alleged to have violated applicable laws or regulations including improper labor conditions or human rights abuses, fails to meet our requirements or does not meet industry standards and safety specifications. Any of these risks, in isolation or in combination, could restrict the availability of merchandise or significantly increase the cost of such merchandise, require us to divert financial and management resources from more beneficial uses and subject us to reputational damage, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",,,,N/A

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, e-commerce sales represented 28% of our revenues. It is one of our strategies to continue to increase the proportion of our revenues from our e-commerce channel. The success of our e-commerce channel depends, in part, on our ability to offer attractive, reliable, secure and user-friendly online platforms for consumers across our markets, including by continuing to invest in our digital infrastructure and digital team. However, our e-commerce business also depends on factors over which we have limited control, including changing consumer preferences and buying trends. Any failure by us, or by any of our third-party digital partners, to provide attractive, reliable, secure and user-friendly online platforms could negatively impact the shopping experience of consumers, resulting in reduced website traffic, diminished loyalty to the Birkenstock brand and lost sales. In addition, as we continue to expand and increase the global presence of our e-commerce channel, sales from our retail stores and wholesale channel in areas in which we introduce online stores may decline due to changes in consumer shopping habits and digital cannibalization. We are also subject to certain additional risks and uncertainties associated with our e-commerce platforms, including changes in required technology interfaces; website downtime and other technical failures; costs and technical issues from website software upgrades; data and system security; computer viruses; and changes in applicable federal and state regulations. We also must keep up to date with competitive technology trends, including, among other things, the use of new or improved technology, creative user interfaces and other e-commerce marketing tools, such as paid and unpaid search, and mobile applications, which may increase our costs, and which may not succeed in increasing sales or attracting consumers.

In the year ended September 30, 2020, 54.9% of our sales occurred in the second half of the financial year (March to September). We incur significant additional expenses in advance of and during this period in anticipation of higher sales during that period, including the cost of additional inventory, which is stored on palettes in our warehouses until shipped, fixed cost such as rent and lease agreement for retail shops and outlets as well as depreciation and amortization of production plants that were temporarily closed. Lower demand may result in excess inventory, which may require us to sell these products at discounted prices or to build up more finished goods inventory than expected incurring additional costs, which could, in turn, adversely affect our results of operations. At the same time, if we fail to manufacture a sufficient quantity of merchandise, we may not have an adequate supply of products to meet consumer demand or if weather conditions permit us to sell seasonal products early in the season, this may reduce inventory levels needed to meet customers’ needs later in that same season, which could have a negative impact on our sales during our busiest season.

36,Final Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to Our Business,1.1.21,We are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations.,"We operate and sell products globally, and, as a result, we generate a portion of our sales and incur a portion of our expenses in currencies other than our functional currency, euro, which are primarily U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds and Canadian dollars. As a result of our significant presence in the United States, we are particularly exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar, and following the Transactions, a large portion of our indebtedness will be denominated in U.S. dollars. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, approximately 52% of our sales were in currencies other than euro. Accordingly, movements in exchange rates between any of these currencies and the euro could have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition to the extent there is a mismatch between our earnings in any foreign currency and our costs that are denominated in that currency. Where possible, we manage foreign currency risk by matching same currency revenues to same currency expenses. However, we are exposed to risk as a result of the increasing amount of invoicing being done in local currency, particularly our subsidiaries in the United States. Such currency risks are monitored by our senior management in the context of annual budgeting and the hedging strategy is adjusted from time to time during the course of the year. In the past three years the hedging arrangements for euro to U.S. dollar covered approximately between 50% to 70% of the expected U.S. dollar exposure. There is no guarantee that our hedging strategy will be successful. In addition, while we report our results in euro, we have revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities in other currencies, primarily as the result of our ownership of our subsidiaries located in other countries. Our subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities are converted based on the exchange rate on the balance sheet date, and income statement items are converted based on the average exchange rate during the relevant financial period. Exchange rates have seen significant fluctuation in recent years, and significant increases in the value of the euro relative to such currencies could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results. As a result, any fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",,,,N/A

Unforeseen disruption of a production facility could be caused by a number of events, including a maintenance outage, power or equipment failure, fires, floods, earthquakes or other natural disasters, social unrest or terrorist activity, work stoppages, public health concerns (including pandemics), regulatory measures or other operational problems. For instance, four of our manufacturing facilities experienced temporary shutdowns due to COVID-19 in 2020. A prolonged disruption at a manufacturing facility could result in production downtimes or temporary operation at reduced capacity preventing us from completing production in a timely manner, leading to loss of business volume, and reduced productivity or profitability at a particular production site. Even less severe problems involving our production facilities, such as missed shipment dates, split shipments, defective software or materials, or logistics problems, could lead to delays.

The protection of customer, employee and company data is critical to us. Customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information from cyberattack or other security breaches. A significant breach of customer, employee, or company data could damage our reputation and result in lost sales, fines, or lawsuits. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach or attack could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected, we may be unable to anticipate these methods or promptly implement preventative measures. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position. In addition, in light of our collection, use and processing of personal data, we are subject to a number of laws relating to privacy and data protection, including the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (“GDPR”), the California Consumer Privacy Act, and other applicable data protection and privacy laws across our various markets. Such laws govern our ability to collect, use and transfer personal data, including relating to consumers and business partners, as well as any such data relating to employees and others. We routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information (including debit or credit card details of consumers) by electronic means and therefore rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of such information in line with regulatory requirements. Therefore, we are exposed to the risk that such data could be wrongfully appropriated, lost or disclosed, damaged or processed in breach of privacy or data protection laws which could lead to the imposition of fines or regulatory action, together with associated negative publicity. For example, breaches of the GDPR can result in significant fines based on percentages of our annual global turnover. Any perceived or actual failure by us, including our third-party service providers, to protect confidential data or any material non-compliance with privacy or data protection or other consumer protection laws or regulations may harm our reputation and credibility, adversely affect revenue, reduce our ability to attract and retain customers and consumers, result in litigation or other actions being brought against us and the imposition of significant fines and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",,,,N/A

New laws or regulations or changes in existing laws and regulations, particularly those governing the sale of products or in other regulatory areas such as consumer credit, labor and employment, tax, competition, health and safety or environmental protection, may conceivably require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement and could increase our cost of doing business. See also “—We are subject to various regulations governing the use and _processing of personal data, and any failure to protect confidential information could harm our reputation and expose us to litigation.”_ For example, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the use of hazardous materials in our footwear production processes. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we may face fines, penalties or other sanctions, as well as resulting in damage to our image and brand. In addition, we could incur future expenditures to remediate past compliance failures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, changes in laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement or alternative interpretation of existing laws and regulations in jurisdictions in which we currently operate can change the legal and regulatory environment, making compliance with all applicable laws and regulations more challenging. Various governments and intergovernmental organizations could introduce proposals for tax legislation, or adopt tax law, that may have an adverse effect on our worldwide effective tax rate, or increase our tax liability, the carrying 42 ----- value of deferred tax assets, or our deferred tax liabilities. Changes in laws and regulations in the future could have an adverse economic impact on us by tightening restrictions, reducing our freedom to do business, increasing our costs of doing business, or reducing our profitability. In addition, the compliance costs associated with such evolving laws and regulations may be significant. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations can lead to civil, administrative or criminal penalties, including but not limited to fines or the revocation of permits and licenses that may be necessary for our business activities. We could also be required to pay damages or civil judgments in respect of third-party claims.

Incidents at our production facilities and warehouses could result in injury to our employees, third parties, or environmental damage, such as damage resulting from the accidental discharge of hazardous materials used in our production process. Our product development and manufacturing processes involve the use of chemicals and other hazardous materials, such as (but not limited to) zinc oxide, drain star, acetate, diesel, and steel care sprays. These programs and processes expose us to risks of accidental contamination, events of non-compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulatory enforcement, personal injury, property damage and claims and litigation. If an accident occurs, or if contamination is discovered, we could be liable for clean-up obligations, damages or fines and could incur significant capital expenditures, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, the environmental laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose obligations to clean up contaminated sites. These obligations may relate to sites that we acquire, own or operate, that we formerly owned or operated, or for which we may otherwise have retained liability or where waste from our operations was disposed. Were such environmental clean-up obligations to arise, they could significantly reduce our profitability. In particular, any financial accruals which we may make for these obligations might be insufficient if the assumptions underlying the accruals prove to be incorrect, or if we are held responsible for additional contamination. We are also subject to various foreign and local laws and regulations pertaining to occupational health and safety that require us to maintain a safe workplace environment, maintain documentation of work-related injuries, illnesses and fatalities, complete workers’ compensation loss reports, review the status of outstanding workers’ compensation claims and complete certain annual filings and postings. Failure to comply with these and other applicable occupational health and safety requirements could result in fines and penalties, and could require us to undertake certain remedial actions or be subject to suspension of certain operations. From time to time, our employees are involved in health and safety-related incidents at our production facilities. These incidents have resulted and could result in the future in regulatory investigations and penalties, as well as regulatory and private claims. For example, the Rhineland-Palatinate Structure and Approval Directorate, a regional government agency, conducted in 2019 an inspection at our Strödt production facility, after a safety incident involving a riveting machine. Following the inspection, the governmental agency required us to implement certain remediation actions, which we promptly instituted. Stricter environmental, health and safety laws and enforcement policies could result in substantial costs and liabilities for us, and could result in the handling, manufacture, use, reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants being subject to greater scrutiny by relevant regulatory authorities than is currently the case. Compliance with these laws could result in significant capital expenditures, as well as other costs, thereby potentially having a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",,,,N/A

The consistent, efficient and secure operation of IT is therefore critical to the successful performance of our operations and the products we sell. Despite IT maintenance and security measures, our IT systems and networks are exposed to the risk of malfunctions and interruptions from a variety of sources, including equipment damage, deficient database design, power outages, computer viruses and a range of other hardware, software and network problems. We have experienced temporary outages in our IT systems in the past. Although we have countermeasures in place to prevent malfunctions and interruptions, any such malfunctions or interruptions could compromise the operational integrity of these systems and networks should our countermeasures fail in the future. In addition, we rely on systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding our consumers, customers, suppliers, employees and others, including credit card information and personal information. We also store data in third-party data centers and use third-party servers or applications by means of cloud computing. As the importance of our e-commerce channel continues to increase, the salience of this risk has increased. Our systems, websites, data (wherever stored), software or networks, and those of third parties (including data centers), are vulnerable to security breaches, including unauthorized access (from within our organization or by third parties), computer viruses or other malicious code and other cyber threats that could have a security impact. We may not be able to anticipate evolving techniques used to effect security breaches (which change frequently and may not be known until launched), or prevent attacks by hackers, including phishing or other cyber-attacks, or prevent breaches due to employee error or malfeasance, in a timely manner, or at all. Cyber-attacks have become far more prevalent in the past few years, leading potentially to the theft or manipulation of confidential and proprietary information or loss of access to, or destruction of, data on our or third-party systems, as well as interruptions or malfunctions in our or third parties’ operations. In addition, our IT systems have been in the past, or in the future may be, the target of cyber-attacks or other security breaches. For instance, we use order, fulfillment and customer relationship management systems as part of our e-commerce operations and other sales channel, and human resource management systems as part of our employee services and payroll processes, and such systems may be subject to security breaches. We implement mitigation measures from time to time, as we identify new threats and risks. We cannot assure you that such measures will be effective or that breaches or other cyber-attacks, including industrial espionage or ransomware attacks will not occur in the future. Failure to effectively prevent, detect and remediate security breaches, including attacks on our IT infrastructure by hackers, viruses, employee error or misconduct, or other disruptions could seriously harm our operations and the operations of our customers. Such breaches may result, among other things, in unauthorized access to trade secrets, confidential business information and personal information, data losses, business interruptions, non-compliance with legal requirements, legal claims or proceedings, deterioration in customer relationships and reputational harm. See also “—We are subject to various regulations governing the _use and processing of personal data, and any failure to protect confidential information could harm our reputation and expose us to litigation.” In addition, due to the constantly evolving nature of security threats, we_ cannot predict the form and impact of any future incident, and the cost and operational expense of implementing, maintaining and enhancing protective measures to guard against increasingly complex and sophisticated cyber threats could increase significantly. While we regularly review our network security, backup and disaster recovery, enhanced training and other security measures to protect our systems and data, security measures 44 ----- cannot provide absolute security or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every breach or disruption on a timely basis. Furthermore, certain measures we may undertake to update our IT systems may be subject to works councils’ codetermination rights. While works councils have been co-operative in the past, a potentially extensive exercise of these co-determination rights may result in operational difficulties and in us being prevented from implementing planned policy or IT system changes. See “—We are dependent on good _relationships with our employees and employee representative bodies and stakeholders.”_ Any disruptions of our IT systems, including as a result of cyber-attacks and industrial espionage, may disrupt operations, or result in legal liability.

Adjustments made by a national tax authority may not lead to a corresponding adjustment in the other tax jurisdiction. Also, even where a corresponding tax adjustment is allowed, national tax rates may be different and may therefore increase our overall burden of taxation.

For example, both the COVID-19 pandemic and the civil unrest in the United States in 2020, led to reduced footfall at our retail stores as well as at other stores that are supplied by our wholesale partners in Europe and the United States, and adversely impacted our results for the year ended September 30, 2020. In particular, our result may be materially adversely affected by events that could generally deter consumers from shopping in store, both in relation to retail stores directly managed by us as well as in relation to stores or outlets supplied by our wholesale partners. Such events could also disrupt the internet or mobile networks and may also prevent or deter consumers from shopping through our e-commerce channel, which could materially adversely affect our sales. In addition, if any of our facilities, including our distribution facilities, our own retail stores, the facilities or stores of our wholesale partner, or the facilities of our suppliers, distributors or any of our other third-party service providers, are affected by any such natural disasters, catastrophic events or other events outside of our control, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Accordingly, we are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing real estate. Store leases generally require us to pay a fixed minimum rent and sometimes a variable amount based on a percentage of annual sales at that location. For certain leases, if sales targets are not achieved or if the sales-based rent amount decreases below a certain minimum, the lessor may terminate the lease agreement, unless we agree to an increased fixed fee rent. Moreover, in relation to lease agreements entered into for retail space in shopping or outlet centers, we also entered into a service and marketing agreement, specific to that specific shopping or outlet center, which may contain conditions that differ from the marketing practices we usually adopt. Many lease agreements provide for a fixed initial term, and an option for us as lessee to extend such term. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be committed to perform certain obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying rent for the balance of the applicable lease term. As each of our leases expires, if we do not have a renewal option, we may be unable to negotiate a renewal on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations.

On March 29, 2017, the UK government invoked Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to begin the process of formally leaving the European Union, and on January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom withdrew its membership in the European Union and entered into a transition period which expired on December 31, 2020. On December 24, 2020, the European Union and United Kingdom announced that they had reached the EU—UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which was implemented on December 31, 2020 and entered into force provisionally on January 1, 2021. Despite the implementation of the EU—UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, there remains significant uncertainty as to how the agreement will affect relations between the United Kingdom and the European Union. While the EU and the United Kingdom agreed a comprehensive, zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade pursuant to the EU—UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the end of the transition period on that date has, among other things, led to increased customs, health and safety checks at the border, which has delayed and disrupted the movement of goods between the EU and the United Kingdom and may undermine bilateral cooperation in key policy areas, significantly disrupt trade between the United Kingdom and the EU and cause political and economic instability in other countries of the EU. Additionally, following the end of the transition period, the United Kingdom has ceased to be a member of the EU single market, which has ended the free movement of services and workers between the United Kingdom and the EU and may make it more difficult for our United Kingdom operations to do business with customers or suppliers that are based in the EU. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the United Kingdom generated 2.2% of our sales and we imported less than 1% of our raw materials from the United Kingdom. The impact of the new trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union and the resulting effects on the political and economic future of the United Kingdom, remain uncertain. Economic instability and uncertainty in Europe, has and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",,,,N/A
36,Final Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to Our Business,1.1.41,Climate change and related regulatory responses may adversely impact our business.,"There is increasing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Changes in weather patterns and an increased frequency, intensity and duration of extreme weather conditions could, among other things, disrupt the operation of our supply chain, increase our product costs and impact the types of products that consumers purchase. For example, certain of our retail locations in Europe and the UAE could fall below the flood line in the next twenty years. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In many of the countries in which we operate, governmental bodies are increasingly enacting legislation and regulations in response to the potential impacts of climate change. For example, in Germany, we are required to undergo energy audits every four years. In addition, the German government has set broader long-term carbonreduction targets as well, and pursuant to such regulation, our business falls under the broad “industry” sector, a category that will need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50.7% (from 1990 levels) by 2030. These laws and regulations, which may be mandatory, have the potential to impact our operations directly or indirectly as a result of required compliance by us, as well as by our suppliers, wholesale partners and distributors. In addition, our manufacturing processes may be affected by new regulations in response to climate change. If we are perceived to be a contributor of greenhouse gas emissions or global warming, or if we are perceived as not taking appropriate steps to mitigate our effect on the environment, this could result in damage to our image and brand, which is particularly focused on socially conscious individuals. In addition, we have and may continue to take voluntary steps to mitigate our impact on climate change. As a result, we may experience increases in energy, production, transportation and raw material costs, capital expenditure or insurance premiums and deductibles.

The objective of the due diligence process is to identify attractive investment opportunities based on the facts and circumstances of an investment, to identify possible risks associated with that investment and to prepare a framework that may be used from the date of an acquisition to drive operational achievement and value creation. When conducting due diligence, the Sponsor typically evaluates a number of important business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental and legal issues in determining whether or not to proceed with an investment. Outside consultants, legal advisors, accountants and investment banks are involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment. Nevertheless, when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment, the Sponsor relies on resources available to them, including information provided by the target of the investment and, in some circumstances, third party investigations. Instances of bribery, fraud, accounting irregularities, contingent liabilities and other improper, illegal or corrupt practices can be difficult to detect, and fraud and other deceptive practices can be widespread in certain jurisdictions. There may be liabilities that the Sponsor failed or was unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations into the Target Business in connection with the Acquisition.

Upon closing of the Acquisition, certain Group companies, in particular in Germany, may forfeit their existing interest carryforwards on the Acquisition Closing Date. Furthermore, on June 20, 2016, the Council of the European Union adopted the Directive (EU) 2016/1164 (ATAD I) laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market. The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive contains five legally binding anti abuse measures, which member states are generally required to apply against common forms of aggressive tax planning since January 1, 2019. Part of the package of measures is the implementation of an interest limitation in line with German rules. The restriction of the deductibility of interest expenses for tax purposes may have adverse consequences for our financial position and results of operations. The Council of the European Union has also adopted Directive (EU) 55 ----- 2017/952 (ATAD II) targeting mismatches which needed to be implemented by December 31, 2019, but have not been enacted in Germany to date. The German ministry of finance issued a new draft bill on the implementation of the aforementioned directives on December 10, 2019, and published updates of such draft bill on March 24, 2020 and November 17, 2020. Amongst others, according to this draft bill, expenditures for intercompany financing may be disallowed in the current and future tax periods. The draft bill intends to broaden the existing rules on corresponding inclusions and deductions of income and expenses and introduces provisions to counter tax shortfalls due to mismatches from the use of hybrid financial instruments or hybrid entities or due to dual tax residency and, furthermore, introduces new arm’s length provisions on intercompany financing that may ultimately limit the deduction of interest expenses on intercompany loans. If the draft bill is enacted and depending on the final wording of the new legislation, the introduction of aforesaid rules could result in higher taxable income and a higher tax burden for corporate income tax and trade tax purposes in the current and future tax periods. Further measures may follow as part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project. The interest limitation rules deriving from ATAD I have been implemented in Luxembourg. According to the Luxembourg interest limitation rules, net borrowing costs incurred during a given fiscal year may only be deductible up to the greater of (i) 30% of the taxpayer’s EBITDA and (ii) €3,000,000. In addition, certain of our German subsidiaries have considerable tax loss carryforwards which have partially been capitalized as deferred tax assets in our Financial Statements. The use of such existing tax loss carryforwards and ongoing losses for German corporate income and trade tax purposes may be forfeited in case of a direct or indirect transfer of shares, subject to certain limited exceptions. Such restriction, applying to both corporate income and trade tax, depends on the percentage of share capital or voting rights transferred within a five year period to one acquirer or person(s) closely related to the acquirer or a group of acquirers with a common interest. Under current rules, if more than 50% of the share capital or voting rights are transferred to such an acquirer, tax loss carryforwards and current losses will be forfeited to the extent no exception from the general forfeiture rules can be applied, such as the built-in gains exemption pursuant to which tax loss carryforwards survive to the extent taxable built-in gains are available at the level of the loss-carrying entity. To the extent that the utilization of tax losses is restricted, they cannot be set off against future tax profits which would result in higher future tax burdens compared to the situation in which tax loss carryforwards can be used to lower the actual tax burden on profits. Such restriction may require a write down of the deferred tax assets in our consolidated financial statements and would negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. Furthermore, upon the creation of a fiscal unity for German corporate and trade tax purposes, any tax loss carryforwards and interest carry forwards for German corporate income and trade tax purposes of a subsidiary, which have been incurred before the creation of the fiscal unity, will be excluded from use for the duration of the fiscal unity.",,,,N/A

These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. Neither the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements nor the Indenture contain a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a different measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be 56 ----- “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the Senior Term Facilities whose interest rates are linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. These reforms and other pressures may cause such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted.",,,,N/A

Such debt includes their obligations under the Senior Secured Facilities. Although the Indenture will contain restrictions on the ability of the Guarantors to incur additional debt, any additional debt incurred may be substantial and rank senior to the Note Guarantee. Upon any payment or distribution to creditors of a Guarantor under the Indenture in respect of an insolvency event, the holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor will be entitled to be paid in full from the assets of such Guarantor before any payment may be made pursuant to such Note Guarantee. Until the senior ranking debt of such Guarantor is paid in full, any distribution to which holders of the Notes would be entitled but for the subordination provisions included in the Intercreditor Agreement shall instead be made to holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor as their interests may appear. As a result, in the event of insolvency of a Guarantor under the Indenture, holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor may recover more, ratably, than the holders of the Notes, in respect of the Guarantor’s Note Guarantee. In addition, the subordination provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the Note Guarantees will provide: - customary turnover provisions by the Trustee and the holders of the Notes for the benefit of the holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor; 57 ----- - that if a payment default on any senior ranking debt of a Guarantor has occurred and is continuing, Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of its Note Guarantee until such default is cured or waived; - that if any other default occurs and is continuing on any designated senior ranking indebtedness that permits the holders thereof to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee receives a notice of such default, such Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of the Notes, or pursuant to its Note Guarantee, until (among others) the earlier of the waiver or cure of such default and 179 days after the date on which the applicable payment blockage notice is received; and - that the holders of the Notes and the Trustee are prohibited, without the prior consent of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors, from taking any enforcement action in relation to such guarantee, except in certain circumstances. The Indenture will also provide that, except under very limited circumstances, only the Trustee will have standing to bring an enforcement action in respect of the Notes and the Note Guarantees. Moreover, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture will restrict the rights of holders of the Notes to initiate insolvency proceedings or take legal actions against each of the Guarantors under the Indenture and by accepting any Note each such holder will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions.

In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or other winding up, our assets that secure debt ranking senior or equal in right of payment to the Notes will be available to pay obligations on the Notes on a pro rata basis with debt ranking equal in right of payment to the Notes only after the senior secured debt has been repaid in full from these assets. There may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the Notes then outstanding. The Indenture will not prohibit us from incurring additional secured debt, nor will it prohibit any of our subsidiaries from incurring additional liabilities. Generally, claims of creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any) of non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to their respective parent entity or the creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors. Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary of the Issuer becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction: - the creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors (including the holders of the Notes) will have no right to proceed against the assets of such non-Guarantor subsidiary; and - creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any) will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder (as applicable), will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

See “Description of the Notes—Security.” In addition, a portion of the Collateral, the Shared Collateral, will also secure the Senior Term Facilities and the ABL Facility on a senior-priority basis and the Notes on a junior-priority basis, and may secure additional debt ranking senior to or pari passu with the Notes and the Note Guarantees. Although the pledge over the shares of the Issuer will secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof on a first-priority basis and will not secure the Senior Secured Facilities, such pledge may secure additional debt ranking pari passu with the Notes, to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders may therefore be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by the Collateral or a reduction of the value of the Collateral securing the Notes. In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral will be applied in repayment of any Super Senior Liabilities (to the extent the Designation Date has occurred), followed by (or unless the Designation Date has not occurred) any lenders under the Senior Term Facilities, among others, before repayment of the Notes and Note Guarantees. To the extent the claims of the holders of the Notes exceed the value of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees, those claims will generally rank equally with the claims of the holders of all other existing and future senior debt ranking pari passu with the Notes and the Note Guarantees. As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as Collateral is less than the value of the claims of the holders of the Notes, those claims may not be satisfied in full. In addition, not all of our assets will secure the Notes, and the Indenture will allow the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure certain types of debt permitted to be incurred under the Indenture (which may be structurally senior to the Notes and the Note Guarantees) with the property and assets of the restricted subsidiaries that do not secure the Notes. The value of such assets and property could be significant. If an event of default occurs and the obligations under the Notes are accelerated, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of unsecured debt of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property or assets that is excluded from the Collateral securing the Notes.",,,,N/A

In the event of an enforcement of the pledges in respect of the Notes, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the pledges may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes including due to the reasons described in the preceding sentence. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers. 59 ----- The Collateral that is pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of such Collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, such as Germany, include restrictions on persons who may hold certain of our licenses, authorizations and consents that are necessary to operate our business. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security Documents, enforcement of the Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets will not secure the Notes and it is possible that the value of the Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by the Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, which may leave little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. The Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes.

If we designate a Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture, all of the liens on the Collateral owned by such subsidiary and any Note Guarantees by such subsidiary will be released under the Indenture, subject to certain conditions. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as such will reduce the aggregate value of the Collateral securing the Notes to the extent of liens securing the shares of such unrestricted subsidiary or of its subsidiaries.

The Issuer is organized under the laws of Luxembourg and the entities expected to provide Notes Guarantees are organized under the laws of Luxembourg, Germany and the United States. With respect to the Issuer and any Guarantor organized under the laws of a member state of the European Union, there is a rebuttable presumption that the “centre of main interest” as defined in the Council of the European Union Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings (recast) is the jurisdiction where the registered office is situated. In addition, the Collateral will include a pledge over the shares in the Issuer and Lux SPV, which are entities organized under the laws of Luxembourg, and security interests in certain present and future intercompany loan receivables held by the Issuer. The insolvency laws of other jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer, the enforceability of a Note Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the Security Interests. In certain circumstances the court may also void the Security Interest or the Note Guarantee if the company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Note Guarantee or the Security Interests provided by such security provider; - direct that the Issuer and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Note Guarantee or any Security Interest to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to you. If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Note Guarantee or Security Interest is found to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor or security provider under its Note Guarantee or the Security Interests will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors and security providers under the Security Documents will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire Note Guarantee or Security Interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See also “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other _limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral.”_ 63 ----- In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Note Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests created, the Guarantor or security provider: - issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its insolvency; - issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent business person as a shareholder of such Guarantor or security provider would have contributed equity to such Guarantor or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Note Guarantee or Security Interest knew or should have known that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made; or - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Note Guarantee or Security Interest on the basis that the Note Guarantee or Security Interest were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Note Guarantee or the creation of the Security Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due. Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Note Guarantee or created any Security Interest if: - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute; or - its liabilities exceed the liquidation value of its assets, unless it has a positive going concern prognosis. Although we believe that both the Issuer and the Guarantors are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or security provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Note Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date its Note Guarantee was issued or the Security Interests were created, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

Enforcement of the obligations under a Note Guarantee against, and/or any Collateral provided by, as applicable, any such Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or similar laws as well as regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally, particularly by limiting the amounts recoverable under the Note Guarantees and Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security provider under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Note Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Note Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or such 64 ----- Note Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors or managers of such subsidiary Guarantor or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. The Note Guarantees and/or security interests granted by a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft _mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbH”) or a partnership with a GmbH as liable partner (i.e., a GmbH & Co. KG) for_ the purpose of guaranteeing or securing liabilities of its direct or indirect shareholders or a subsidiary of such shareholders (excluding direct or indirect subsidiaries of such GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG) are considered to constitute a benefit for such shareholder and therefore are subject to certain capital maintenance and liquidity maintenance rules. Therefore, any Note Guarantees provided by a GmbH will be subject to certain contractual limitations (so called “limitation language”) contained in the Indenture (or any other document under which any Note Guarantee is granted) and that are or will be contained in the Security Documents, respectively, designed to ensure compliance with applicable capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or any other general statutory laws. These principles apply mutatis mutandis to a GmbH & Co. KG. Any guarantee and/or security interest granted by a GmbH or any other entity incorporated/established under the laws of Germany (including by German NewCo) may be held invalid pursuant to Section 138 BGB and would therefore not be enforceable if, at the time of the creation or enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security interest, among others, the third party creditor and the affiliate have acted in fraudulent conveyance (kollusives Zusammenwirken) to the detriment of the GmbH or other third party creditors of the GmbH. As a result, the Guarantor’s or security provider’s liability under its Note Guarantee or Collateral could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law and contractual enforcement restrictions applicable to it. This could lead to a situation in which such Note Guarantee or Collateral cannot be enforced at all. It is possible that a Guarantor or security provider, or any of their creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s Note Guarantee or the security provider’s Collateral on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Note Guarantee or Collateral should be limited or voided. To the extent that any limitations on the relevant Note Guarantees or Collateral apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or security provider, including trade payables of such Guarantor or security provider. Future Note Guarantees and Collateral may be subject to similar limitations.

Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book entry interests in the global Notes representing the Notes and credited by 65 ----- such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and if investors are not participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

Instead, if an investor owns a book entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent it has received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis. Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book entry interests, if investors own book entry interests, they will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable.

In such a situation, the Issuer may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Notes that are tendered under any such offer. If a significant principal amount of Notes is tendered, the Issuer will likely have to obtain financing to pay for the tendered Notes. However, the Issuer may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A change of control may also result in a mandatory prepayment under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements and agreements governing any future indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of such indebtedness. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes upon a change of control would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements. The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers, recapitalizations or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a change of control as defined in the Indenture.

43,Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to Our Operating Environment,1.1.1,"Uncertain global economic and financial market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.","The general economic and financial market conditions in Europe and other parts of the world have undergone significant volatility in recent years. We are especially exposed to the macroeconomic conditions affecting Europe and North America, which accounted for 43.2% and 34.7%, respectively, of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020. Since early 2020, the primary factor in increased uncertainty globally from an economic and social perspective has been the global outbreak of COVID-19 (the “COVID-19 pandemic”). The resulting broader economic downturn and slowing global economic growth has increased the risk of weakened demand for a wide range of our products. The COVID-19 pandemic may result, and in many jurisdictions has already resulted, in restrictions such as limitations on travel and transportation of goods, closure of businesses and public offices, quarantines and general lockdowns, the duration of which are uncertain. This has resulted, and may continue to result, in materially increased volatility and declines in financial markets and weaker demand in the global economy. Furthermore, such measures implemented, or intended to be implemented, by governments or governmental bodies could have a material adverse effect on supply chains and generally impact business operations across the economy both as a result of weakened economic activity and in terms of the health and wellbeing of employees being affected. Several central banks and governments have announced and employed financial stimulus packages in anticipation of a significant negative impact on gross domestic product. However, there is no certainty that these policy tools will counter anticipated macroeconomic risks. This has resulted, and may continue to result, in materially increased volatility and declines in financial markets and weaker demand in the global economy. Furthermore, global economic conditions have been, and are likely to continue to be, affected by concerns over increased geopolitical tensions as well as political developments, such as the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union (“Brexit”) on January 31, 2020, and the threat of escalated trade disputes on a global level. See “—The result of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative _effect on our business.” In addition, developing markets, such as South America, are generally subject to greater_ political, economic and social uncertainties than countries with more developed institutional structures, and the risk of losses resulting from changes in law, authorities’ practices and interpretations, economic or social upheaval and other factors may be substantial. These or other geopolitical tensions, political developments around the world and a global trend toward protectionism have affected the global economic conditions and increased market uncertainty and volatility and may continue to do so in the future. It is difficult to predict how market conditions will develop, as they are impacted by macro movements of the financial markets and many other factors, including the stock, bond and derivatives markets as well as measures taken by various governmental and regulatory authorities and central banks, over which we have no control. Uncertainty remains in the global markets and the global economy could experience another recession, or a depression, which could be more prolonged or have a greater financial impact than the global recessions that began in 2008. Our business is affected by the trends in global investment activities and cyclical fluctuations in our customers’ end-use segments. The uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets may diminish 33 ----- customers’ ability or willingness to make investments, as a result of which order decisions may be postponed or cancelled, which could decrease our sales and impair our profitability. In addition, uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets may have a negative effect on the availability and cost of financing. Our liquidity and access to financing may be materially affected by changing conditions in the financial markets, or our capital resources may not, at all times, be sufficient or readily available to satisfy our liquidity needs. We may not necessarily be able to utilize the opportunities arising from the economic fluctuations or to adapt to a long-term recession or stagnation of the economy. The materialization of any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, future cost of debt and access to bank and capital market financing in the future, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A
43,Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to Our Operating Environment,1.1.2,"Demand for our products may be affected by, among other factors, the cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate and changing market conditions.","Our products are generally affected by the cyclical nature of our industry in terms of selling prices, raw material prices and delivery volumes, and the cycles may vary in different customer industries and in geographic regions. Demand for our products is affected by global, regional and national macroeconomic conditions that affect end-users of our products. Accordingly, we are also exposed to cyclical changes in the various industries in which our customers operate, such as everyday consumables, health care and life science, homebuilding and furniture as well as transportation and industrial end-use segments. The cyclical nature of the fiber-based solutions and products industry may result in overcapacity and consequently put pressure on the pricing of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. In the absence of sufficient economic growth, periods of local excess supply may decrease the demand for our products and lead to decreases in market selling prices. Demand for our products could also decline due to various other factors in our operating environment, some of which are discussed elsewhere in these “Risk Factors.” Shifts in the patterns of demand, whether foreseen or not, could also strain the flexibility of our asset base and leave some assets underutilized, while others may become overloaded. See also “—Risks Related to Our _Business and Operations—Our production operations involve operational risks, and failures or deficiencies in the management of operational efficiency could have a material adverse effect on us” below._ Any decreases or changes in the patterns of demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A
43,Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to Our Operating Environment,1.1.3,"We operate in highly competitive markets, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.","The segments for fiber-based solutions and products in which we operate are highly competitive, and we compete with multinational corporations, regional manufacturers and specialized manufacturers. Certain of our products are priced in a competitive market environment at prevailing market prices, which may result in small margins. The competitive environment has tightened in some of our product segments, particularly for release liner and coated one-sided segment used for flexible packaging in Europe, filter materials in North America and in export markets for decor papers outside of Europe. Some of our competitors may be able to take advantage of stronger economies of scale benefits due to larger sites, higher investment capacity or other operational benefits, such as ability to utilize integrated pulp at their sites. In addition, existing or new competitors may enter one or more of our key markets, or they may seek to increase their market share through aggressive pricing strategies or otherwise. Existing or new competitors may begin to manufacture products that compete with certain of our products, by adapting their existing production capacity or by investing in new capacity. If this were to occur to any significant degree, decreased prices for those products would likely follow, thus adversely affecting the profitability of our business. The COVID-19 pandemic may also accelerate the decline in the consumption of printing and writing paper and may trigger the conversion of paper machines to production of products in segments other than printing and writing paper in which we are operating. Furthermore, our products may face competition from alternative materials, such as petroleum-based materials including plastics. If the use of other products and materials in certain applications increases at the expense of fiber-based solutions and products, there is a risk that demand for our products will decrease. The electrification of mobility is picking up momentum and impacts one of our larger customer segments, the transportation industry, which may negatively impact demand for our combustion engine filtration products. Although this impact may be offset by new solutions that are being developed where new types of 34 ----- filters are needed for applications such as battery cooling and air filtration, there can be no assurance that we will benefit from such trends. In addition, we may be subject to long-term adverse trends in demand for paper. For example, use of fine paper has declined since the 1990s and conversion has increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See also “—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations—We may not be successful in product development and _innovation or in development of our production processes to keep pace with competitors, or we may be forced to make further investments due to technological developments in the industry” below._ Failure to adapt to industry trends, sustain the investments necessary to compete effectively, properly manage our response to increased competition, or otherwise compete effectively, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A
43,Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to Our Operating Environment,1.1.4,Changes in the costs or availability of raw materials and energy could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.,"Our primary raw materials are wood, pulp, wood necessary to produce pulp, renewable annual fibers, various synthetic fibers, including glass, and plastic, as well as chemicals, including titanium dioxide, and energy. Our cost base is primarily variable, with variable costs, such as fibers, other raw materials and energy, constituting 65% of our total costs for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our commodity pulp consumption was approximately 1,200 thousand tons for the year ended December 31, 2020. Volatility, price increase and the availability of raw material, particularly of pulp, impact our margin on variable costs and results. Our pulp exposure was reduced by approximately 500 thousand tons of our own pulp production during the year ended December 31, 2020, which includes 185 thousand tons of market pulp production at our Aspa pulp mill in Sweden that is sold to third parties. The price and availability of raw materials and energy may fluctuate significantly depending on a variety of factors, including business cycles in the relevant markets, supply conditions, government regulations, natural disasters and other factors that are difficult to predict and beyond our control. While raw material costs, particularly for pulp and titanium dioxide, have decreased in 2019 and 2020, any substantial increases in the cost of pulp, energy or other raw materials that we use could have a material adverse effect on our results. In addition, decreasing raw material prices may also put additional pricing pressure on some of our products as customers may expect decreased raw materials costs to be passed through to them. The level of raw materials production capacity is also a key factor that impacts price and availability of raw materials. Global overproduction of raw materials generally decreases the price and increases the availability of raw materials, whereas underproduction generally decreases the availability of raw materials in the market, which may result in a price increase. Natural disasters or issues with our supply agreements could also cause the prices of raw materials or energy to increase. Price increases in raw materials, energy and services, such as transportation, that cannot be offset by corresponding price increases of our products and solutions could impact our margins and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to pass price increases to our customers through increases in the prices of our products is dependent on several factors, including demand and the negotiation power of our major suppliers and customers. While we have generally been able to pass through increases in the costs of raw materials and energy to our customers, our ability to continue doing so depends on several external factors, such as demand for our products and the negotiation power of our major suppliers and customers. As a result, we may not be able to reliably pass through increases in the costs of raw materials and energy to our customers. Furthermore, we may experience significant time delays in passing through these price increases for various reasons, including limits in contractual provisions or competitive pressures. In the event of a significant increase in the price, or a significant disruption in the supply, of raw materials or energy, we may have to purchase raw materials or energy from alternate sources, which could significantly impact our ability to provide competitively priced products to our customers in a timely manner. Furthermore, while we are not dependent on any specific supplier, certain major suppliers to an individual business may be costly or difficult to replace, particularly if there are supply shortages. If any of the above factors were to materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A

Our purchases of raw material and/or sale of products have in the past, and may in the future, become subject to new or tightened export control regulations, sanctions, tariffs, embargoes or other economic and trade restrictions in the future, and such measures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Authorities in the countries in which we operate or from which we import our products may impose new custom duties to imports, or repeal current ones, which could have a material adverse effect on the supply of products or their prices. Changes in the level of custom duties may have a material adverse effect on our ability to import our products or the profitability of our domestic operations in markets where such protectionist measures are applied. The global nature of our business operations subjects us to sanctions and regulations imposed by a multitude of jurisdictions. For example, we must comply with laws and sanctions regulations of the United States, the European Union and the United Nations. International economic and trade sanctions are complex and subject to frequent change, including in relation to jurisdictional reach and to the list of countries, entities and individuals subject to sanctions. While we regularly monitor the situation, ensuring compliance with such controls and regulations may be difficult or costly and there is a risk that it could become subject to investigations or claims by authorities or contracting parties. Although we have trade compliance procedures and controls in place, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be effective or that we will not be deemed to be engaged in dealings with entities or individuals subject to sanctions through our operations. New or possible further trade restrictions, protectionist measures, sanctions or economic slowdown resulting from increased economic or political instability in certain regions could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

Emerging markets are generally subject to political, economic and social uncertainties, and the risk of losses resulting from changes in law, authorities’ practices and interpretations, economic or social upheaval and other factors may be substantial. Among the more significant risks of operating and investing in emerging markets are those arising from the introduction of trade restrictions, enforcement of foreign exchange restrictions, inflation and changes in tax laws and enforcement mechanisms. Operations in certain emerging market countries may also include the risk of the possibility of expropriation or nationalization of assets.

On January 31, 2020, Brexit became effective and the United Kingdom entered into a transition period during which the European Union and the United Kingdom acted as if the United Kingdom was a member of the European Union (the “Transition Period”). Following the expiry of the Transition Period, the United Kingdom ceased to be treated as a member of European Union on December 31, 2020. Although on December 24, 2020 the United Kingdom and the European Union agreed to a trade agreement (the “Trade and Cooperation Agreement”), there are still a number of areas of uncertainty in connection with the future of the United Kingdom and its relationship with the European Union and the application and interpretation of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, and Brexit-related matters may take several years to be clarified and resolved. The United Kingdom may still face barriers to trade and commerce with the European Union and may still lose its present rights to the global trade deals negotiated by the European Union on behalf of its members, which may in turn diminish overall economic activity between the United Kingdom and the European Union and the United Kingdom and its global trade partners. Given this uncertainty and the range of possible outcomes, it is currently impossible to determine the impact that Brexit, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement and the nature and extent of responses by the United Kingdom in the formulation of fiscal and monetary policies and any related matters may have on general economic conditions in the United Kingdom. It is also not possible to determine the impact that these matters will have on our business. 36 ----- Although we have made preparations to ensure business continuity, there can be no assurance that our suppliers’ and customers’ current business operations will not be impacted by Brexit, or that the consequences of Brexit on the European Union’s border with the United Kingdom will not affect supplies to us or lead times of deliveries. In addition, the Scottish regional government is actively considering a second referendum on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom, which may lead to additional uncertainty and may affect our business activities in Scotland and other parts of the United Kingdom.

Our ability to grow and to maintain our competitiveness depends on our continued ability to identify and respond to changes in consumer and industry preferences and demand, develop our production and launch new and improved products in a timely manner using our existing or new production capabilities in all of our key markets and manufacture and market our products in changing markets. In addition, our production chains are fairly complex, which may cause additional challenges in responding to specific customer and industry needs. The speed with which new products are rolled out to the market is essential for our continued competitiveness. We may not be successful in launching new products on time or as expected during the planning and development process as the commercialization process may require a considerable amount of time. Our business operations depend on our ability to foresee commercial and technological developments in our key markets, and to implement such developments. If we are unable to effectively foresee or implement such developments, a competitor rather than us may benefit from such developments. We may be required to make large investments to acquire such developments, or may be unable to acquire such developments, which could, in turn, affect our ability to compete with our competitors. For example, while we are currently exploring opportunities for new applications to be used in electric vehicles, changes in the use of electric vehicles may occur more rapidly than expected or the market for electric vehicles could stagnate. There can be no certainty that we will be able to foresee future developments in a timely manner or future developments may require significant additional investments to remain competitive in the sector. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in continuing to meet our customers’ needs through innovation or in developing new products or technologies, or that, if developed, any such new products or technologies will meet the needs of our customers. We may not be able to recover investments that we have made in order to develop these new products or technologies, and may not have sufficient resources to keep pace with technological developments.

In recent years, we have undertaken certain investments in order to improve product capability, the efficiency of our production processes and to increase capacity. In 2019 and 2020, we have, among other things, completed the rebuild of the recovery boiler and debottlenecking of the pulp line in Billingsfors, Sweden, the bailing line modernization at the Aspa pulp plant in Sweden, the production line upgrade of decor paper in Dettingen, Germany, the expansion of coating capabilities in Jacareí, Brazil, a rebuild of our converting line of sterilization wrap at our Pont-Audemer plant in France and the installation of a new cogeneration plant at our site in Turin, Italy. In addition, in 2018, we announced an investment of approximately €28 million to strengthen our manufacturing platform for high performance filtration and energy storage applications. This project, which is expected to be completed during the second half of 2021, consists of a significant expansion of our micro glass capacity and a further growth in our industrial filtration capacity in Turin, Italy, Fabriano, Italy, Malmedy, Belgium and Binzhou, China. In 2018, we also announced an investment currently expected to be approximately €37 million in a second-hand Voith production line that will produce tea bag and coffee pod materials at our Chirnside plant in the UK, has partially been delayed and has incurred additional costs in an amount of €9 million. The deviation in the capital expenditure spending and timeline is a result of the complexity of the project, reduction in capital expenditure plans in 2019 which placed the project on hold, as well as the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, we announced an investment of €7 million related to a new coating machine to enable formaldehyde-free balancing and finish foils for furniture and the building and construction industries. The investment will also help reduce carbon dioxide emissions and increase production capacity. The coating machine is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. We have also acquired several new production facilities as a result of our corporate acquisitions and there can be no certainty as to the need for capital expenditure and maintenance investments relating to equipment, machinery and other assets of the newly acquired production facilities or in any future corporate acquisitions. The investments we undertake may not be completed in the expected timeframe or at all, may experience budget overruns or may not result in the benefits that we expect, and the newly acquired production facilities may be subject to significant unexpected capital expenditure and maintenance costs.

We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates in the future and even if we identify a suitable acquisition or investment candidate, we may not be able to finance such acquisition on favorable terms, if at all. We acquired Expera Specialty Solutions, a U.S. based specialty paper producer (the “Expera Acquisition”), and Caieiras in Brazil (the “Caieiras Acquisition”) in 2018. In 2019, we achieved the targeted cost synergy run rate of €21 million from the acquisition of Expera Specialty Solutions and Caieiras, exceeding the initial target of €14 million and actions implemented during 2020, which were delayed due to the COVID-19 related lockdowns and travel restrictions, generated a further €2 million of synergies. We expect to generate additional business synergies of at least €8 million from the Expera Acquisition, with a gradual impact from 2021 onwards. We are also exploring options to acquire or invest in Minglian, a Chinese company comprising a greenfield decor paper plant in the city of Xingtai, Hebei Province, China. The COVID-19 pandemic-related lockdowns and travel restrictions have delayed the negotiation and signing of the transaction, which could happen as early as during the first half of 2021. See also “—Problems associated with any reorganization of our operations or _divestments of businesses could have a material adverse effect on us.”_ Achieving the remaining or the anticipated benefits of the Expera Acquisition and other corporate acquisitions or investments largely depends on timely and efficient integration of their business operations, 38 ----- processes and ways of working with us, which, in turn, are also dependent on the management’s time and resources available to the acquired entities. There can be no assurance that we will achieve such remaining or anticipated benefits in the expected timeframe or at all. We may also encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions or investments with our operations, applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions or in managing strategic investments. Acquisitions are also subject to a number of risks related to the assessment of the acquired business or other investments, including its value, strengths, weaknesses, potential profitability, assets and liabilities. Diligence reviews of acquisition or investment targets may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost or potential loss contingencies with respect to a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities. Even a detailed review of the acquired entity may fail to identify and discover potential liabilities and deficiencies, including legal claims, claims for breach of contract, employment related claims, tax liabilities and other liabilities (whether or not contingent), which could result in significant future additional costs and liabilities. Furthermore, indemnities and other contractual protections in the acquisition or investment documentation may not protect us against all or part of every known liability or deficiency, and may incur unanticipated costs or expenses in connection with such transactions, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation and other liabilities, including related to warranties. Target companies may be located in countries in which the underlying legal, economic, political and cultural conditions do not correspond to those customary in our key areas of activity or have other national peculiarities with which it is not familiar. In addition, any future acquisitions or investments may be subject to regulatory approvals by competent national and supra-national authorities, including competition authorities, which we may be unable to obtain without unreasonable expense or delay, if at all. We may not realize the targets for growth, economies of scale, cost savings, development, production and distribution, or other strategic goals that we seek from the relevant acquisition or investment to the extent or in the timeframe anticipated, and the attention of management and other personnel may be diverted for long periods of time. Moreover, the purchase price may prove to have been too high or unforeseen restructuring or integration expenses may become necessary. In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or any possible future outbreaks could increase the uncertainties regarding the execution of corporate acquisitions or other investments and the acquired companies’ planned integration with our business operations and lead to additional costs. Furthermore, the overall effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or any possible future outbreaks of the virus on the global economy could erode the acquired companies’ businesses or the investment opportunity in a way that unpredictably decreases their value for us.

For example, we implemented a new business and reporting structure beginning January 1, 2020, with a view to supporting profitable growth, competitiveness as well as customer support. In addition, we may, from time to time, divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or growth or profitability targets. For example, in 2020, we divested our fine art paper business in Arches, France and our glass fiber reinforcement business in Mikkeli, Finland. In addition, we are actively considering strategic alternatives in relation to our entire Decor paper business, including any potential ownership in Minglian, where one of the options being investigated the possibility of divestment of the Decor business. The successful execution of any reorganization plans or divestments is dependent on a number of factors, including the correct timing and execution of the plans, co-operation of our employees and customers, ability to maintain operational efficiency and in case of a divestment, ability to negotiate favorable terms with the buyer. Any reorganization of business operations may have a material adverse effect on us and may result in customers reducing or cancelling orders or terminating their customer relationship with us entirely. Any significant reduction in sales could lead to overcapacity, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our ability to utilize our production capacity efficiently or profitably. In addition, any divestment may also subject us to surviving warranties under the applicable terms, some of which may be uncapped in time and/or 39 ----- amount. Such plans could also result in the loss of key executives or employees, may result in labor claims, litigation or reputational harm.

Raw material supply issues have not caused any significant interruptions of production. Our investment project in a second-hand Voith production line that will produce biodegradable and compostable tea and coffee infusion materials at our Chirnside plant in the UK, however, has partially been delayed and has incurred additional costs in an amount of €9 million. The deviation in the capital expenditure spending and timeline is a result of the complexity of the project, reduction in capital expenditure plans in 2019 which placed the project on hold, as well as the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and any possible future outbreaks of the virus among our employees, or if employees are unable to work as a result of being quarantined, may have an adverse effect on our operations and could lead to significant interruptions of production. In addition, the current pandemic or any possible future outbreaks of the virus could have an adverse effect on our suppliers, distributors, logistics and other supply chain operations, resulting in a deficit of supplies necessary to carry out our operations, and therefore possibly disrupting output deliveries to customers. Although we have taken measures to decrease operational risks arisen due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there can be no assurance that the chosen measures will be effective, especially if the COVID-19 pandemic persists for a long period. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic or any possible future outbreaks or COVID-19, including any new variants thereof, or of other viruses could negatively affect the demand of our products. For example, the exceptional circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, with regional lockdowns and limited mobility for citizens, have resulted in lower restaurant traffic, which has slowed demand for food processing and packaging products. Similarly, demand for home building and furniture, transportation and industrial end-uses has decreased. In 2020, we implemented actions, such as temporary layoffs, shorter working hours and minimizing 40 ----- the use of external personnel and services, to mitigate the financial impact of lower volumes, in particular during the second and third quarters of 2020. Any failure to successfully adapt our business operations or strategy to the changing operating conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or any future outbreaks or materialization of any other risks mentioned above, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A

The new, stronger platform is intended to benefit our way of doing business by utilizing the data and the opportunities for further digitalization. The business platform is expected to enable growth strategy implementation and generate efficiency, agility, transparency, improve stakeholder value and contribute to profitable growth. The business platform renewal started in 2020 with a planning phase and will be implemented over several years. Achieving the estimated benefits of the renewal will involve certain risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve the estimated benefits of the renewal within the currently estimated timeframe, or at all. In addition, increased digitalization of our business may increase certain of the risks described in this “Risk _Factors” section, including the risks described under “—Any significant problems with our IT systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”_ Risks and challenges relating to the renewal of the business platform include, but are not limited to, the following: - introduction and implementation of a new operating model and business processes; - implementation of new IT technologies; - placement of demands on our resources to manage the process internally, which may affect the management’s ability to run our business effectively during the renewal process; and - co-operation with our employees and customers. The expected benefits from the renewal of the business platform as well as the related costs are inherently uncertain and based on a number of our assumptions and judgments. In addition, the renewal might not be completed in the expected timeframe. The materialization of any of the above described risks could result in us not being able to achieve the estimated benefits from the renewal and cause additional costs to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A

Any inability to adjust production capacity may lead to opportunity loss, in the case of increasing demand, or to cost burdens, in the case of decreasing demand. Rapid production changes may be challenging to implement, which could also increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions. We typically only produce goods against orders received, rather than for stock. However, a variety of conditions may cause customers to reduce, delay or cancel anticipated or confirmed orders and lower capacity utilization to align the production with the demand. Any inability to maintain operational efficiency could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any interruption or disruption in production at our production sites, whether due to lack of orders, labor action, environment-related accidents, breakdown of major paper, pulping or other production machines, interruptions in the distribution of energy, system failures or service interruptions in IT systems, fire, accidents, natural hazards, catastrophes, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, unexpected geological or other physical conditions, criminal or terrorist acts, pandemics, transportation disruptions, problems in our supply agreements or other factors, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our production goals and result in lost opportunities in the future.

Our ten 41 ----- largest customers generated 19.0% of our net sales in the year ended December 31, 2020 and no single customer represented more than 10% of our net sales in same period. However, we have customers that are significant to the operations of an individual business area. Additionally, a number of our customers are, or could in the future be, under pressure in their own domestic markets from imports, in particular from Asia, and may consequently lose market share or have to relocate their production or converting facilities to other markets, which could cause our customers to reduce the volume of their purchases. The loss of a significant number of our key customers, if not replaced with new customer agreements on similar terms, or a significant reduction in sales to any such customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are also exposed to a risk of customer concentration. The industries in which our customers operate may be subject to future consolidation.

The operation of our IT systems and software could be interrupted by power cuts, software or telecommunication errors or disasters such as fires or natural disasters, as well as human errors made by our own staff or third-party suppliers. If our IT systems and software were to become unusable or their function were to be significantly impaired for any reason during an extended period of time due to, for example, systems and software becoming outdated or due to a lack of sufficient resources for IT support from third-party suppliers, our operations could be adversely affected, since our production processes and our ability to deliver products on time, order raw materials and handle inventory are largely dependent on our IT systems and software. Difficulties in renewing, maintaining, upgrading and outsourcing our IT systems and software could result in increased costs and damage to our reputation in the eyes of our customers and other third parties, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Despite our security measures and back-up systems, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers, computer viruses or malicious code. Various cyber threats have increased in recent years along with the digitalization of companies’ operations. We may be targeted, for example, by phishing or malware attacks, denial-of-service attacks, breaches in information or data systems, ransomware or attacks targeting production processes. It may also be difficult for us to detect cyber-attacks upon their occurrence, which could have an impact on the size of damage. In addition, our information technology and infrastructure may be breached due to employee error, malfeasance or affected by other disruptions, including as a result of natural disasters or telecommunications breakdowns or other reasons beyond our control.

This, in turn, depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. We have taken active measures to obtain protection of our intellectual property by obtaining patents, trademarks and by monitoring activities in our major markets. In addition to our patent portfolio and trademarks, we rely on trade secrets, know-how, the development of new products and technological development in combination with non-disclosure and other agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the measures that we take to protect our intellectual property may not effectively deter competitors from improper 42 ----- use of our intellectual property. Protection of intellectual property rights may be more challenging in some of the regions in which we operate. For example, in the past there have been attempts in China to misuse the name and logo of Ahlstrom Corporation, one of our predecessor companies. Competitors, suppliers and customers may misappropriate intellectual property owned or licensed by us, disputes as to ownership of intellectual property may arise and intellectual property may otherwise become known by or independently developed by competitors, suppliers or customers. In addition, certain technologies and processes used by us may be subject to the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such third parties may take legal action for infringement of these intellectual property rights and any such claim could delay or prevent the delivery of our products. We may not be successful in defending against this or other challenges brought against our intellectual property rights, may be required to pay royalties for the use of patents or trademarks of third parties for key technologies or may need to make substantial investments to research and develop suitable alternatives. We, at times, rely on trade secrets instead of other forms of protection for our patents or trademarks when patent or trademark protection is not possible, such as, for example, when the particular technology which was used could not be exactly identified or would not qualify for patent or trademark protection, or in our opinion would be less effective than maintaining secrecy. In addition, we rely upon confidentiality agreements with our employees, contractors and other third parties. To the extent that we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements, there can be no assurance that our efforts to maintain secrecy will be successful or that third parties will not be able to develop the product, technology or know-how independently.

These requirements are complex and frequently change, and they have tended to become more stringent over time. The passing of new or amended laws or regulations, could require us to adopt more stringent standards, could restrict our operational or strategic flexibility or require significant costs and investments. In addition, our operations are subject to different environmental permits, with which we must comply. We will incur capital and operating costs in our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations. For example, wastewater discharges and air emissions are highly regulated, and large investments are required to ensure compliance with applicable requirements. There can be no assurance that the requirements of such laws and regulations and the associated cost of compliance will not increase in the future. Adapting operations to such changes may require us to incur costs that are difficult to anticipate, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations in the EU are also affected by the cost of compliance with the EU Emissions Trading System (“ETS”) in accordance with directive 2003/87/EC, as amended, establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading. If our carbon dioxide emission levels exceed the rights in our possession, we must purchase sufficient carbon dioxide emission allowances. From 2013 onwards, manufacturing companies have generally had to purchase a steadily increasing amount of emission rights in auctions, for which the costs for emission allowances are difficult to foresee. The cap on total annual emissions in the EU will gradually be reduced in phase four of the ETS starting from 2021, and auctions will become the main method for issuing allowances. Further, regulations on chemicals, such as EU Regulation (No 1907/2006) concerning chemicals and their safe use, aim to improve the protection of human health and the environment through a system of registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals, and may also impose obligations and related costs on us. For example, we use titanium dioxide as a raw material for manufacturing certain types of specialty papers. The European Commission has approved the classification of titanium dioxide as a category 2 carcinogen under the CLP regulation (1272/2008/EC) and the harmonized classifications will apply from September 9, 2021. The change in the classification could impose additional obligations and costs on us and the use of titanium dioxide in our products could generate reputational harm for us. Any of the above events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 43 ----- Other environmental and health and safety expenditures relate to maintenance, inspection and security requirements, contingency arrangements for emergency preparedness and insurance coverage. Industrial operations, including our production processes are inherently fraught with risks of substantial environmental costs and liabilities. We may be unable to predict future changes to laws, regulations and operating permits, which may require us to incur increased operating costs and additional liabilities on us. We are also required to comply with the provisions of anti-corruption legislation in jurisdictions in which we operate. There can be no assurance that our current and past policies and monitoring systems have been or will be able to detect or prevent all potential instances of illicit conduct, or that such policies have been or will be fully and consistently applied throughout our organization. While we seek to exercise best practices in compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our past and current policies and monitoring systems were or are able to detect or prevent all potential instances of illicit conduct. We have adopted data protection practices with the aim of being compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the “GDPR”) and other applicable data protection laws and regulations applicable to our business and operations. Compliance with the GDPR and other laws and regulations or potential inadequacy of our data protection practices may cause problems, difficulties or additional costs for us.

Furthermore, data protection authorities may be vested with the power to impose corrective actions, including temporary or definitive bans on data processing, and to impose fines for breaches of the GDPR or other applicable laws and regulations. If we or our employees, distributors or suppliers, violate any of the applicable laws and regulations, we could experience increased costs or delays in the delivery of our products, be subject to fines, damages or penalties as well as orders and sanctions imposed by supervisory authorities and courts.

Health and safety-related incidents have occurred in the past at our production sites and could occur in the future. Such incidents could result in injury to our employees, harm to employees and disruptions in production processes, which may result in costs and other liabilities and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and could damage our reputation and ability to recruit qualified employees. Our operations result in emissions of substances in the air and water, and generate noise. Production processes and products, which by their nature require the use of chemicals and materials that are potentially harmful to the environment and result in the generation of waste products that require special treatment. Many of our manufacturing facilities are situated in locations with a long history of environmentally harmful industrial use, including the use, storage and disposal of hazardous materials. We are currently, and could in the future be, required to investigate, remediate, monitor or otherwise pay for remediation or other clean-up measures at locations where operations are currently pursued or where they have been pursued in the past, and such payments may be material. Such liability for costs might also arise with respect to real estate property that we own, have previously owned or where predecessor companies previously had operations, or in connection with a closure of a production facility. Even where liability is the result of predecessor actions, these costs may not be adequately covered by predecessors or we may be liable for such costs in the future even after a production facility is closed or sold. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we made environmental provisions of €15.8 million. There can be no guarantee that our environmental provisions will be sufficient to cover any environmental liabilities that we may incur. Our product development and manufacturing processes involve the use of chemicals, such as organic solvents and other mineral additives, and other hazardous materials. Our operations also result in emissions of substances in the air and generate noise. These programs and processes expose us to risks of accidental contamination, such as accidental discharge of untreated water used in the production process, events of non-compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulatory enforcement, personal injury, property damage and claims and litigation resulting from such events. Any environmental accident or finding, employee injury, occupational disease or other health and safety issue could impose significant liabilities and remedial costs on us as well as result in reputational damage. In 44 ----- addition, individuals (employees as well as third parties) could seek damages for alleged personal injury or property damage due to accidents or exposure to chemicals, materials or substances that are currently used or were used in the past by us or that are present at facilities operated by us. The Rottersac and Arches production sites in France have been designated as sites where employees have been in contact with asbestos from 1956 to 1997 and from 1960 to 1992, respectively. As a result of potential exposure to asbestos, employees employed at the Rottersac and Arches production sites during these periods are entitled to or have already opted for early retirement. In addition, we are aware of a number of cases where individual employees and/or their beneficiaries have presented asbestos indemnification claims for their illness, alleged loss of salary, anxiety suffering (préjudice d’anxiété) and difficult living conditions (trouble dans les conditions d’existence). While we sold our fine arts paper business which was housed by the Arches production site, to Italy-based F.I.L.A. Group in the first quarter of 2020, we continue to remain liable for these claims under the terms of the sale. Although we do not believe that these claims will have a material effect on our financial condition, there can be no assurance that further claims will not be made against us. While we have an outstanding provision of €1.5 million as of December 31, 2020 to cover outstanding asbestos-related claims by employees, there can be no guarantee that such claims will not increase or that new claims will not be brought in the future. We may face other asbestosrelated liabilities as asbestos has been identified in materials and structures in certain current and former productions sites. If materials and structures containing asbestos become damaged or are renovated or demolished, additional costs may be incurred. If any of the above-mentioned risks were to materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The quality targets of our customers in many product segments are very high and tend to have risen further in recent years, which highlights the importance of consistency and repeatability in production processes to ensure customer satisfaction. Furthermore, certain of our products are used in the food and medical industries, where key customers have stringent requirements regarding the products they purchase and conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with applicable regulations, including consumer protection, health, safety and hygiene standards. The consequences of quality or safety issues due to, for example, accidental or malicious raw material contamination or due to supply chain contamination caused by human error, sabotage or equipment fault could be severe. Detected faults or defects in products or in product descriptions discovered at a critical point in our production chain could interrupt production in the unit concerned and disturb the entire chain’s operations. Such disturbances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our products are generally integrated into and become a part of more valuable end products. If a product supplied by us is found to be defective and causes the end product to fail, our potential liability may be higher than the cost of the faulty product sold by us.

There can be no assurance that damages to the production facilities or losses resulting from production interruptions are fully covered by insurance. The COVID-19 outbreak has adversely changed and may continue to change the characteristics of the global insurance market, making it less favorable to insurers amidst the outbreak. We seek to use leading insurance brokers and insurance companies for our business. However, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential liabilities. Accordingly, a major claim, or a series of smaller claims, for damages related to our products sold, or advice given to customers in connection with products sold, 45 ----- may not be fully covered by insurance, or may not be covered by insurance at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We maintain insurance coverage for, among other things, property damage, business interruption and product and general liability in amounts believed to be consistent with industry practices, but it is not fully insured against all risks, and insurance against all types of risks and catastrophic events may not be available on reasonable economic terms or at all. In addition, our global operations make it more difficult to manage the insurance coverage, as insurance practices and terms vary depending on the jurisdiction, and there can thus be no assurance that we are able to maintain a sufficient insurance coverage in all the jurisdictions in which we operate. The occurrence of an accident that causes losses in excess of limits specified under the relevant policy or is subject to material deductibles or self-insured retentions, or losses arising from events not covered, or not fully covered, by insurance policies, such as certain catastrophic events, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In the past, certain of our customers have experienced, and may experience in the future, financial and operational challenges, the continuation or exacerbation of which could place them in additional financial and operational distress or could even result in their bankruptcy. Although we have in place certain procedures and controls, such as credit insurance and additional credit risk assessment, such measures may not fully or adequately alleviate our exposure to such credit risks. For example, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may have a negative effect on the business of our customers, especially in the short-term. See “—The COVID-19 pandemic and possible future outbreaks could _disrupt our business operations.”_ Furthermore, a prolonged duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including any future outbreaks of the virus or of a similar pandemic, or the other changes in the global economy may put additional financial stress on our customers. Financial and operational challenges experienced by customers may impact our ability to collect outstanding accounts receivables fully or in a timely manner, or at all, and, consequently, result in credit losses and have a material adverse effect on our cash flows. In an uncertain economic situation, it may be difficult to cover our customer credit risks with credit insurance. In addition, the failure by customers to fulfill their payment obligations towards us may have a material adverse effect on the terms or availability of credit insurance for us. These factors, combined with limited availability of credit, could also cause our customers to reduce the volume of their purchases in an effort to improve their own financial position. An uncertain economic situation also leads to increased counterparty risk, that is the risk that one or more of our counterparties may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to us. The financial downturn following the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this risk. As uncertainty remains in the global markets, the global economy could fall back into a recession which could lead to banks, insurance companies and other corporations facing financial difficulties, which, in turn, may lead to corporate restructuring arrangements, states taking over companies and bankruptcies. Despite any efforts by us to manage our counterparty risk, there is a possibility that one or more of our counterparties could face serious financial difficulties or bankruptcy. If counterparty risk materializes, we may have to absorb losses in an amount higher than expected or may incur costs relating to, among other things, rearranging our credit transactions, including on less favorable terms, such as an incremental change in our financing rate or insurance contracts. Further, counterparty risks that materialize could force us to obtain alternative financing to meet our obligations under our financing arrangements, and such financing may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, or at all.

Related companies must conduct any intercompany transactions on an arm’s length basis and provide sufficient documentation thereof, subject to applicable rules of the relevant jurisdiction. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) has recently published new guidance on transfer pricing. National tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing and challenging companies’ transfer pricing policies. In addition, the estimation of our total income taxes requires thorough consideration and numerous filings in various countries and the final amount of taxes related to certain transactions and calculations cannot be estimated with full certainty. Our tax burden is, therefore, dependent on specific aspects of tax laws and regulations in several jurisdictions including their application and interpretation. Changes in tax laws or regulations or their application or interpretation could significantly increase our tax burden, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These include the recent limitations on the right to deduct interest expense and controlled foreign company rules, implemented into national tax laws and applied as of the year 2019, due to the Council Directive (EU) 2016/1164 of 12 July 2016 laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market (as amended from time to time). Furthermore, the introduction of the OECD multilateral instrument and the inclusion of the so-called principal purpose test in the same could increase uncertainty with respect to application of tax treaties. In addition, we are currently and will be, from time to time, subject to general tax audits by national tax authorities. At the date of this Offering Memorandum, we are subject to tax audits or tax litigation in Italy, Germany, India, Brazil, the United States (Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Illinois) and China. As a result of ongoing or future tax audits or other review actions of tax or other authorities, additional taxes (such as income taxes, withholding taxes, real estate taxes, capital gains taxes, transfer taxes and value added taxes) could be imposed, which could lead to an increase in our tax liabilities either as a result of the relevant tax payment being imposed directly against us or as a result of us becoming liable for the relevant tax as a secondary obligor. Tax audits and claims could have a material adverse effect on us. We and our predecessors have historically grown by acquisitions, with the most significant being the Expera Acquisition and the Caieiras Acquisition in 2018. Tax authorities may question some of the positions that we or our predecessors have taken and, consequently, additional taxes may be assessed, or tax assets may be challenged. The main items under discussion or already disputed relate to transfer pricing and business-related taxes. Although we currently believe that the above-mentioned processes will not have any significant effect on our financial position or profitability, 48 ----- the realization of any risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A

Accordingly, we will be exposed to various risks related to our defined benefit plans, including the risk of actual investment returns being lower than assumed rates of return and the risk of results deviating from actuarial assumptions for areas such as mortality of plan participants. In addition, fluctuations in interest rates may cause changes in the annual cost and benefit obligations. Higher than expected inflation may increase benefit obligations and annual payments to insurance companies. The additional amount of future contributions to our defined benefit plans will depend upon factors mentioned above and, as a result, the amounts we will be required to contribute in the future may vary. Cash contributions to defined benefit plans will reduce cash available for our business. The above-mentioned risks relate in particular to our plans that are in effect in Sweden, Germany, France, Italy, the United States and the United Kingdom. As of December 31, 2020, Ahlstrom-Munksjö’s employee benefit obligations in the balance sheet amounted to €93.1 million.

In addition, our relations with employees represented by a labor union are governed by certain collective bargaining agreements and we may not be able to renegotiate satisfactory collective bargaining agreements when they expire, which could lead to, among other consequences, increased labor costs. Such renegotiation could also lead to disputes which may disrupt operations at our production sites. Labor disputes in the transportation sector may prevent the distribution of our products, and labor disputes affecting our suppliers or customers may result in variations in the supply of products and materials to us and in demand for our products and services.

Until such time as the Squeeze-Out has completed or the Issuer has obtained advance title to the remaining minority Company Shares against the placing of a security under the Squeeze-out proceedings, third-party minority shareholders will continue to hold the outstanding Company Shares. The Squeeze-Out is an arbitral proceeding regulated by the Finnish Companies Act and the Finnish Arbitration Act, which could potentially be time consuming, and is subject to appeal by one or more minority shareholders. These proceedings typically take approximately eight to twelve months to complete but advance title to the minority shares may, subject to the discretion of the arbitral tribunal, under the proceedings often be obtained in approximately four to six months against the placing of a security. These proceedings may also be longer due to events outside the Issuer’s control. Further, in the event that the placing of a security by the Issuer for obtaining of the advance title is refused by the arbitral tribunal, the Issuer could decide not to place such security or appeal the arbitral award and if the Issuer decides not to pay the redemption price in accordance with such award, the minority shareholders would potentially continue to hold some or all of the outstanding Company Shares until the Issuer’s redemption right and the redemption price have been finally determined by a non-appealable arbitral award or court decision and such redemption price has been paid by the Issuer.",,,,N/A

The objectives of the due diligence process are to identify attractive investment opportunities based on the facts and circumstances relevant to a specific asset, to identify possible risks associated with such asset and to prepare a framework that may be used from the date of the acquisition of such asset to drive operational achievement and value creation in such asset. When conducting due diligence, the Sponsors typically evaluate a number of important business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental and legal issues in determining whether or not to proceed with an investment. Outside consultants, legal advisors, accountants and investment banks are involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment. Nevertheless, when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment, the Sponsors rely on resources available to them, including information provided by the target of the investment and, in some circumstances, third party investigations. Instances of bribery, fraud, accounting irregularities, contingent liabilities and other improper, illegal or corrupt practices can be difficult to detect, and fraud and other deceptive practices can be widespread in certain jurisdictions. There may be liabilities that the Sponsors failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations into us and our subsidiaries in connection with the Acquisition. Following the Acquisition, the Sponsors may learn of additional information about us and/or any of our subsidiaries that adversely affect us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. As Ahlstrom-Munksjö is a publicly listed company, the due diligence conducted for the Acquisition was mostly limited to publicly available information and certain other information made available to the Sponsors as part of their due diligence process. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that the Sponsors’ due diligence investigation has revealed or highlighted all relevant facts (including fraud, bribery and other illegal activities and contingent liabilities) that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating the merits of investing in us.

We may not be able to realize the anticipated efficiencies and savings targeted by these measures, either in the amount or within the timeframe that we currently anticipate, and the costs of achieving these measures may be higher than what we expect. Our estimated efficiency gains and costs savings are forward-looking and therefore subject to a number of assumptions about the timing, execution and costs associated with realizing the underlying measures. Such assumptions are inherently uncertain and are subject to significant business, economic and competition risks and uncertainties. There can be no assurance that such assumptions will turn out to be correct. In addition, the estimated efficiency gains and cost savings may be offset by deterioration in the markets in which we operate, increases in other expenses or challenges in the business unrelated to the Transactions. As a result, the amount of efficiency gains and savings that we will actually realize and/or the timing of any such realization may differ significantly (and may be significantly lower or later) from the ones that we currently estimate and we may incur significant costs in realizing the Acquisition and in reaching the estimated gains and savings.

The Acquisition may constitute a change of control under such agreements. As a result, counterparties to these agreements may be entitled to terminate their agreements with Ahlstrom-Munksjö as a result of the Acquisition. Some of these counterparties may exercise their termination rights, which could have an adverse effect on Ahlstrom-Munksjö‘s business, financial position and results of operations.

The Issuer will be dependent upon the cash flow from its operating subsidiaries in the form of dividends or other distributions or payments to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees. Given the Group’s international operations, it has a large number of operating subsidiaries and business participations, which individually contribute to our Group’s results. The amounts of dividends and distributions available to the Issuer will depend on the profitability and cash flows of their subsidiaries and the ability of each of those subsidiaries to declare dividends under applicable law or transfer profits under profit and loss transfer agreements, if applicable. The Issuer’s subsidiaries, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to the Issuer to make payments in respect of their indebtedness, including the Notes and the Note Guarantees. Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may actually prohibit, the ability of these subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation. Applicable law as well as profit and loss transfer agreements between several entities of the Group may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. In particular, the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuer will generally be limited to the amount of distributable reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay their respective debt when due.

These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. Neither the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement nor the Indenture contains a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities whose interest rates are linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. In addition, on November 29, 2017, the Bank of England and the FCA announced that the market working group on Sterling Risk-Free Rates would have an extended mandate to catalyze a broad transition to the Sterling Over Night Index Average Rate (“SONIA”) across sterling bond, loan and derivatives markets so that SONIA is established as the primary sterling interest rate benchmark by the end of 2021. The Bank of England and FCA have stated that a key near-term priority for the working group will be to make recommendations relating to the potential development of SONIA reference rates. A public consultation was launched in July 2018 in relation to specific queries related to the operations of SONIA reference rates. On April 23, 2018, the Bank of England took over administration of SONIA and issued a series of reforms as part of its implementation as a replacement to LIBOR. From April 2018, the Bank of England has been setting the interest rate benchmark using SONIA, meaning that banks are no longer compelled by the FCA to submit LIBOR rates beyond 2021. These reforms and other pressures may cause such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted.",,,,N/A

The Senior Secured Credit Facility permits, and the Indenture will permit, additional indebtedness to be secured on the Collateral in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will only enforce the Collateral as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and the Indenture regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. Prior to the Issuer designating any liabilities as Super Senior Liabilities in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (such date of designation (if any), the “Designation Date”), the Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that consists of the holders of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, the senior lenders, creditors in respect of indebtedness ranking pari passu with the senior creditors and creditors in respect of certain non-priority hedging obligations (the “Senior Secured Credit Participations”) which aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations at that time (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”) (in each case acting through their respective creditor representatives). If the Majority Senior Secured Creditors do not instruct the Security Agent to enforce, or instruct the Security Agent to cease enforcing the transaction security, then, in certain cases, creditors holding more than 50% of the total second lien credit participations (or, in certain cases, creditors holding 50% of the total Topco credit participations) may instruct the Security Agent to enforce. Following the Designation Date, the Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that may consist of either (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or (ii) creditors holding more than 50% of the total participations in Super Senior Liabilities at that time (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”). The Security Agent is required to act in accordance with instructions received from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, however: (i) if and to the extent the obligations under the Super Senior Liabilities have not been fully discharged in cash within six months of enforcement instructions first being issued by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors; or (ii) if the Security Agent has not commenced enforcement action within three months of enforcement instructions first being issued by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors, then the enforcement instructions provided by the Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail. Following the transaction security having become enforceable, if (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue and (ii) (x) the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith that to delay issuing enforcement instructions could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any transaction security or the realization of enforcement proceeds and (y) deliver enforcement instructions which they reasonably believe to be consistent with the enforcement principles and necessary or desirable to enhance the prospects of achieving the enforcement objectives before the security agent has received any enforcement instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, in such circumstances, the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the enforcement instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors. If at any time an insolvency event has occurred with respect to any debtor (other than an insolvency event which is the direct result of any action taken by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors), the Security Agent shall act (i) prior to the Designation Date, in accordance with the instructions of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (without any requirement to first consult with any junior creditors) or (ii) after the Designation Date and to the extent the Majority Super Senior Creditors have provided such instructions, in accordance with the instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors. The Security Agent is not obliged to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of its duties, obligations or responsibilities or the exercise of any right, power, authority or discretion if it has grounds for believing the repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against, or security for, such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it by a member of the Group. In connection with any enforcement instructions received by it, the Security Agent may request security and/or indemnity and/or prefunding satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense (including legal fees). To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes (such as indebtedness incurred as an additional facility under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement), the voting 57 ----- interest of holders of the Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we incur. Creditors of any future Super Senior Liabilities may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Transaction Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral consisting of the shares of the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Note Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such entities securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees may be released. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens.” Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values.

See “Description of the Notes—Security.” In the event of an enforcement of the security interests in respect of the Collateral following an event of default, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been, or will be, made in connection with this Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers. In addition, the Collateral secures, or will secure, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and may secure certain future indebtedness of the Group. Not all of our assets will secure the Notes and the Indenture will allow the Issuer and its subsidiaries to secure certain indebtedness (which may be structurally senior to the Notes and the Note Guarantees) with the property and assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries that do not secure the Notes. The value of such assets and property could be significant. If an event of default occurs and the obligations under the Notes are accelerated, the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of other unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer and their restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property or assets excluded from the Collateral securing the Notes. While the Indenture will create certain obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional security over assets, or a particular class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, such obligations will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain important exemptions and carve-outs. The Agreed Security Principles that will be set forth in the Indenture will include a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Notes to be granted security or guarantees in certain circumstances. The operation of the Agreed Security Principles may result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any security provided being limited or security not being granted over a particular type or class of assets. See “Description of the Notes—Security.” Accordingly, the Agreed Security Principles may affect the value of the security or guarantees provided by the Issuer and the Guarantors. The shares and other Collateral that will be pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of such collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate include restrictions on persons who may hold certain of our licenses, authorizations and consents that are necessary to operate our business. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of 58 ----- investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Transaction Security Documents, enforcement of the Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur, and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets do not secure the Notes and it is possible that the value of the Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. The Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the Transaction Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional Notes under the Indenture or incur additional indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, holders of such Notes or lenders of such debt would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Collateral.

By accepting a Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of a default. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.” In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral is subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over such Collateral are taken, including Italian law, as applicable. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged assets but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in, nor are directly parties to, a Transaction Security Document will be validly secured. This area of law is untested in the courts of Italy. In certain jurisdictions, including France, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the relevant Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and of each of the Guarantors owed to holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (“Principal Obligations”), but in jurisdictions such as Italy where the case law does not currently provide for their application, these Parallel Debt provisions would not be applicable. All or part of the pledges and other security interests in such jurisdictions will be granted to the Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the 60 ----- corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the relevant Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the relevant Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct in financing transactions, including credit facilities and bond issuances, has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions (including Italy) and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created under the Parallel Debt construct are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Collateral. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the _Note Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_ For example, the Collateral governed by the laws of Italy will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent, acting also in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holder of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code. Under such provision (introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of an agent (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantee by a rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries. Furthermore, it is untested in Italian courts whether guarantees and security interests can effectively be granted in favor of an entity acting as “rappresentante” of the noteholders pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code in connection with notes issued by an entity incorporated outside of Italy and absent a resolution by the competent corporate body of the foreign issuer appointing a notary to carry out any formality required under the laws of Italy for the creation of security interests. The enforcement of any Collateral located in Italy or governed by Italian law is subject to mandatory provisions of Italian law, including in relation to limitations and defenses or to limitations contained in the terms of the Security Documents designed to ensure compliance with applicable statutory requirements.

In addition, the Indenture will, subject to certain limitations, permit these non-Guarantor subsidiaries to incur substantial additional indebtedness without such incurrence constituting a default under the Indenture, and such indebtedness may also be secured.

The Issuer is organized under the laws of Finland; and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Finland, France, Italy and the United States. With respect to the Issuer and any Guarantor organized under the laws of a member state of the European Union, there is a rebuttable presumption that the “centre of main interest” as defined in the Council of the European Union Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings is the jurisdiction where the registered office is situated. In addition, the Collateral will include a pledge over the shares in certain of the Group’s subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of Finland, France, Italy and the United States and security interests in certain present and future intercompany loan receivables held by the Issuer and certain of the Group’s subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of Finland, France, Italy and the United States. The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer, the enforceability of a Note Guarantee against any of the Guarantors and the enforceability of the Security Interests. In certain circumstances the court may also void the Security Interest or the Note Guarantee if the company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. 62 ----- In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Note Guarantee or the Security Interests provided by such security provider; - direct that the Issuer and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Note Guarantee or any Security Interest to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to you. If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Note Guarantee or Security Interest is found to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor or security provider under its Note Guarantee or the Security Interests will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors and security providers under the Transaction Security Documents will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each of the Guarantors or security providers under its Note Guarantee or the Security Interests, as applicable. There is also the possibility that the entire Note Guarantee or Security Interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See also “Risk _Factors—Risks_ _Related_ _to_ _the_ _Notes_ _and_ _Our _Structure—Limitations to the Guarantees and Collateral”, “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral.”_ In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Note Guarantees were issued, or the Security Interests created, the relevant Guarantor or security provider: - issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its insolvency; - issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent business person as a shareholder of such Guarantor or security provider would have contributed equity to such Guarantor or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Note Guarantee or Security Interest knew or should have known that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made; or - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Note Guarantee or Security Interest on the basis that the Note Guarantee or Security Interest were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Note Guarantee or the creation of the Security Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due. Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Note Guarantee or created any Security Interest if: - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute; or - its liabilities exceed the liquidation value of its assets, unless it has a positive going concern prognosis. 63 ----- Although we believe that the Issuer and the other Guarantors are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or security provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Note Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date its Note Guarantee was issued or the Security Interests were created, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

Enforcement of the obligations under a Note Guarantee against, and/or any security provided by, as applicable, any such Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or similar laws as well as regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally, particularly by limiting the amounts recoverable under the Note Guarantees and Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security provider under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Note Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Note Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or such Note Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. As a result, the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s liability under its Note Guarantee or Collateral could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law and contractual enforcement restrictions applicable to it. This could lead to a situation in which such Note Guarantee or Collateral cannot be enforced at all. It is possible that a Guarantor or security provider, or any of their creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy or insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s Note Guarantee or the security provider’s Collateral on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Note Guarantee or Collateral should be limited or voided. To the extent that any limitations on the relevant Note Guarantees or Collateral apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or security provider, including trade payables of such Guarantor or security provider. Future Note Guarantees and Collateral may be subject to similar limitations. Specifically, as a result of the applicable limitations under Italian law with respect to, amongst others, financial assistance and corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement, as regards to any Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy (an “Italian Guarantor”): (i) the Guarantee and security interests granted by the relevant Italian Guarantor will only guarantee and secure the Issuers’ obligations under Tranche B (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes and shall not exceed at any time an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of any intercompany loans or other financial support in any form (such term, for the avoidance of doubt, not including equity contributions), advanced from time to time to such Italian Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries pursuant to article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code) by the Issuer (whether directly or indirectly) on or following the Issue Date and outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the relevant guarantee, in each case net of any proceeds already paid pursuant to the enforcement of its guarantee under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement and/or received upon the enforcement of any security interests granted by the Italian Guarantor, and in 64 ----- any event subject to the Intercreditor Agreement provided that the Italian Guarantor shall not be liable as a Guarantor in respect of any amounts in excess of the amount that such Italian Guarantor is entitled to (and actually can) set-off against its claims of recourse or subrogation (regresso or surrogazione) arising as a result of any payment made by such Italian Guarantor under its Guarantee; (ii) the maximum amount guaranteed and/or secured by an Italian Guarantor, also in accordance with article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code (where applicable), will not exceed the lower of (a) 120% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, and (b) the aggregate amount of the original principal amount of Tranche B (as defined in “Use of proceeds”) under the Notes, reduced, from time to time, by an amount equal to any repayment, prepayment or redemption of the principal amount of the Notes multiplied by the ratio of (A) the aggregate amount of the original principal amount of the Tranche B (as defined in “Use of proceeds”) under the Notes to (B) the original principal amount of the Notes; (iii) the aggregate amount of interest guaranteed and/or secured by an Italian Guarantor in respect of any payment obligations under Tranche B under the Notes will be at any time equal to the interest then outstanding in respect of a principal amount of Tranche B under the Notes at that time; (iv) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Indenture, in order to comply with the mandatory provisions of Italian law in relation to (a) maximum interest rates (including the Italian Usury Law and article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (b) capitalization of interests (including article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993), the obligations of an Italian Guarantor under its Guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (A) any interest qualifying as usurious pursuant the Italian Usury Law and (B) any interest on overdue amounts compounded in violation of the provisions set forth by article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code and/or article 120 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993, respectively; and (v) any guarantee, indemnity, obligations and liability granted or assumed pursuant to the relevant Guarantee and/or security interest by any Italian Guarantor does not (and will not) include and does not (and will not) extend, directly or indirectly, to any amounts and/or payment obligations other than the amounts and/ or payment obligations under Tranche B (as defined in “Use of Proceeds”) under the Notes. The abovementioned “virtual tranching” structure in respect of the Notes, which is aimed at identifying the relevant portion of the Notes’ proceeds which does not constitute “acquisition debt” (or refinancing thereof) in respect of any Italian Guarantor and, therefore, does not fall within the prohibition under Italian financial assistance rules (namely, Article 2358 or 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code), is untested in Italian courts and might be deemed insufficient to clearly distinguish and separate the non-acquisition portion of the Notes’ proceeds from any portion of the Notes’ proceeds to be utilized to support the acquisition or subscription by the Issuer of the share capital of, respectively, an Italian Guarantor or an entity directly or indirectly controlling it and/or to repay existing debt originating from previous acquisition schemes and/or otherwise in contravention of any provisions regulating financial assistance. Should the Guarantee and/or the security interests and/or the indemnity granted and/or assumed by an Italian Guarantor be deemed by a court or public authority to be contrary to any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, such Guarantee and/or security interests and/or indemnities as well as any other contract entered in connection therewith, could be declared null and void and the Notes documents will provide that, if and to the extent such Guarantee would result in a breach of any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, applicable to such Italian Guarantor, such an Italian Guarantor will be deemed to have no liability thereunder and the Guarantee shall not be in force and effect ab initio. In addition, the obligations of any Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider that becomes a Guarantor and/or a security provider will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and will be subject to the additional limitations set forth in the relevant supplemental indenture to the Indenture and/or in the applicable security documents, in order for the applicable Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to comply with the above corporate law requirements on, among others, corporate benefit and financial assistance. In any case, the maximum amount that an Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider, in each case, may be required to pay in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture and/or security grantor under the relevant security documents upon enforcement of the security interests granted by such Italian Guarantor will ratably concur and not cumulate with the corresponding amounts due by such Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to any guaranteed and/or secured creditor pursuant to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and/or the Intercreditor Agreement (including any guaranteed and/or secured creditors with 65 ----- respect to any further pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or any security documents, and vice versa. For the avoidance of doubt, by virtue of the abovementioned limitations applicable to the guarantees and the security interests granted by an Italian Guarantor, the obligations of each Italian Guarantor as guarantor and/or security provider under the Notes, the Indenture, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and any agreement regulating future pari passu indebtedness contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement-the security documents relating to the Collateral and any other transaction documents related thereto shall not be deemed to be cumulative and shall be considered without duplication, and the transaction documents will provide that the aggregate amount of the proceeds deriving from any enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security obligations of the relevant Italian Guarantor shall not exceed on an aggregate basis the limit of the relevant Italian Guarantor’s credit support as described above. In addition to the above, under article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a corporate guarantee is issued by a Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant Guarantor’s assets. If such determination is deemed disproportionate to the assets of each of the Guarantors, there is a risk that the guarantee could be declared void. The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests will be distributed amongst the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without, limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover limited amounts under the relevant Note Guarantees and security. In particular, considering that the guaranteed aggregate amount under its Guarantee and related security interests is capped to the amount of the intercompany loans or other financial support in any form received after the Issue Date by the Italian Guarantor or its Subsidiaries and subject to the relevant set off rights described above (which are aimed at avoiding duplications of the exposure between the relevant intercompany loans or other financial support received and the exposure under the Note Guarantee), that Note Guarantee and security interests would have a very limited or no value if no such intercompany loans or other financial support were to be made available to such entities.

In such a situation, the Issuer may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Notes that are tendered under any such offer. If a significant principal amount of Notes is tendered, the Issuer will likely have to obtain financing to pay for the tendered Notes. However, the Issuer may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A change of control would entitle each lender under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement (individually) to cancel its commitments and require prepayment of amounts outstanding to it under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and could trigger put rights, mandatory prepayments or accelerations under other existing or future financing arrangements of the Group. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes upon a change of control would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement. The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers, recapitalizations or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a change of control as defined in the Indenture.

43,Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.6,THE TRANSACTIONS The Transactions,1.6.1,The Acquisitions,"_The Tender Offer_ On September 24, 2020, the Issuer and Ahlstrom-Munksjö entered into the Combination Agreement, pursuant to which the Issuer announced a voluntary public cash tender offer with an offer price of €18.10 in cash for each share validly tendered (the “Initially Announced Offer Price”) for all of the issued and outstanding shares in Ahlstrom-Munksjö that are not held by Ahlstrom-Munksjö and its subsidiaries (the “Company Shares” and the offer, the “Tender Offer”). The completion of the Tender Offer was subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including acceptance of the Tender Offer by shareholders holding more than 90% (on a fully diluted basis) of the Company Shares and voting rights carried by the Company Shares, calculated in accordance with applicable Finnish laws governing the right to commence compulsory squeeze-out proceedings (the “Minimum Acceptance Condition”), together with any Company Shares otherwise held by the Issuer prior to the date of the announcement of the final result of the Tender Offer. The Board of Directors of Ahlstrom-Munksjö, represented by a quorum comprising the non-conflicted members of the Board of Directors, unanimously recommended that the shareholders of Ahlstrom-Munksjö accept the Tender Offer. The Initially Announced Offer Price was subsequently adjusted first to €17.97 per share and then to €17.84 per share (the “Tender Offer Price”) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer, to account for two payments of dividend by the Board of Directors of Ahlstrom-Munksjö after the Tender Offer was announced. On January 15, 2021, the preliminary results of the Tender Offer were announced. The 50,386,853 Company Shares tendered in the Tender Offer, together with the total of 345,524 Company Shares acquired by the Issuer through market purchases and the Company Shares which were to be received by Ahlstrom Invest from the internal reorganization involving certain Ahlström family members and certain related entities and which Ahlstrom Invest B.V. had undertaken to tender into the Tender Offer, represented approximately 81.1% of all the Company Shares and voting rights carried by the Company Shares in Ahlstrom-Munksjö. On January 18, 2021, the Issuer announced that on the basis of the preliminary results of the Tender Offer, it decided to waive the Minimum Acceptance Condition and complete the Tender Offer in accordance with its terms and conditions provided that the final result of the Tender Offer confirmed that the Tender Offer had been validly accepted by shareholders holding at least 75% (on a fully diluted basis) of the Company Shares and voting rights carried by the Company Shares, calculated in accordance with Chapter 18, Section 1 of the Finnish Companies Act. When the final result of the initial offer period under the Tender Offer was published on January 20, 2021, the Company Shares validly tendered and accepted in the Tender Offer (including the Company Shares received by Ahlstrom Invest B.V. as a result of the internal reorganization involving certain Ahlström family members and certain related entities), together with the Company Shares acquired by the Issuer through market purchases, represented approximately 81.0 % of all the Company Shares and voting rights carried by the Company Shares. As such, the Issuer announced that it would complete the Tender Offer as the Minimum Acceptance Condition had been waived and all other conditions to completion were fulfilled. The Issuer also announced that it would commence a subsequent offer period in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer (the “Subsequent Offer Period”) in order to provide the remaining shareholders of Ahlstrom-Munksjö the opportunity to accept the Tender Offer. On February 9, the Issuer announced the final result of the Subsequent Offer Period, pursuant to which the Company Shares validly tendered and accepted during the Subsequent Offer Period, together with the Company Shares validly tendered and accepted during the initial offer period (as extended) and otherwise acquired by the Issuer through market purchases until February 8, 2021, represented approximately 90.6 per cent of all the Company Shares and voting rights carried by the Company Shares. On February 4, 2021 (the “Initial Settlement Date”), the first settlement under the Tender Offer occurred with respect to Company Shares registered with Euroclear Finland Oy and on February 5, 2021 with respect to Company Shares registered with Euroclear Sweden AB, and the Issuer acquired approximately 81.0% of the Company Shares. On February 10, 2021 (the “Second Settlement Date”), the second settlement under the Tender Offer occurred with respect to Company Shares registered with Euroclear Finland Oy and on February 11, 2021 with respect to Company Shares registered with Euroclear Sweden AB, and the Issuer acquired an additional 9.6% of the Company Shares. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuer owned approximately 90.6% of the Company Shares. 71 ----- _The Squeeze-Out_ Under Chapter 18, Section 1 of the Finnish Companies Act, a shareholder holding more than nine-tenths of the total number of shares and voting rights in a limited liability company has the right to redeem and, subject to a demand by other shareholders, is also obligated to redeem the shares owned by the other shareholders in a company at a fair price. The shares held by the company or its subsidiaries are not taken into account when calculating the aggregate number of the shares and voting rights for the purposes of said Section. The Issuer has on February 11, 2021 notified Ahlstrom-Munksjö of its decision to exercise its redemption right pursuant to the Finnish Companies Act and to redeem all the Company Shares held by any other remaining shareholders in Ahlstrom-Munksjö. To implement the redemption of the remaining Company Shares, the Issuer has filed an application to initiate arbitration proceedings as provided in the Finnish Companies Act. In the redemption proceedings, the Issuer will seek a redemption price of €17.84 per Share for the remaining Company Shares, which corresponds to the Tender Offer Price. The arbitral tribunal will determine the timing of the redemption proceedings and eventually decide on the redemption price payable by the Issuer for the remaining Company Shares. The Issuer intends to apply for the delisting of the Company Shares from Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd and Nasdaq Stockholm AB as soon as permitted and reasonably practicable under applicable laws and regulations and the rules of said stock exchanges. Following the completion of the Squeeze-Out, we may undertake certain reorganizations of members of the Group located in Sweden, France or Italy. _Sources and Uses for the Acquisitions_ The funding sources for the Acquisitions (excluding the Squeeze-Out), the repayment or refinancing of the Existing Senior Unsecured Notes, the Hybrid Bond and certain existing bank loans or other debt (excluding the Pension Loan, local lines, leases and other debt and bank loans being rolled over), the dividend held at the Issuer in respect of the Pref Instrument, the payment of related fees and expenses and other costs related to the Transactions consist of proceeds from the following sources: - equity contributions from the Sponsors in the form of subscription to ordinary equity shares equaling approximately €1,120.9 million contributed to the Issuer through intermediate holding companies (the “Equity Contributions”) and the dividend on open market purchases; - drawings under the Senior Term Facilities in an aggregate amount of up to €650.0 million (equivalent) and drawings under the Bridge Facilities that will be refinanced using the proceeds from the offering of the Notes (see “—The Refinancing” below); - cash on hand and dividends paid on the shares acquired through open market purchases after the tender offer was announced.

44,Final Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to Our Business,1.1.1,"Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or other similar pandemics.","The COVID-19 outbreak and spread of the virus globally has adversely affected global macroeconomic conditions and spurred an economic downturn that has led to increased unemployment, lack of real wage increases and static or falling benefits, which have, in turn, negatively impacted consumer confidence and generally fostered more price conscious spending, including in France. COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our operations, including by requiring us to manage the numbers of customers in our restaurants, reduce or temporarily close the operation of certain of our restaurants following evolving guidelines or orders by the French government, invest in protective and other safety equipment and increase our reliance on home delivery and Click & Collect purchase options. We have also faced the risk of product delivery delays or shortages as suppliers adapted to government-mandated restrictions. Further, as a result of the pandemic and government-imposed lockdown restrictions, consumers’ expectations with regard to eating out, particularly with regard to safety and convenience, have changed. For example, the pandemic significantly accelerated the trend of consumer reliance on food delivery options. If consumers’ heavy reliance on delivery services continues and if the trend towards a long-term increase in delivery services compared to pre-pandemic levels is confirmed, even upon the easing of pandemic restrictions, we may continue to face in the longer-term the inherent risks associated with delivery services. See “—Our business is affected by _changes in consumer preferences and perceptions” for a description of the risks associated with a_ sustained level of increased delivery activity. As from March 2020, as a response to COVID-19, we complied with government-mandated shutdowns of restaurants, country-wide lockdowns and safety measures across all our operations in France. As a result of the first lockdown in France, a large majority of our restaurants were shut down from March 17, 2020 through the end of April 2020, after which we underwent, and are still undergoing, a period of gradual and progressive reopening of all our restaurants. We currently only have three remaining restaurants that have not yet reopened: two of which are located in airports, one of which is located in a train station and one of which is located at La Cité des Sciences in Paris and is scheduled to reopen in the short term. During the second lockdown, which was followed by a nationwide curfew, we were able to keep most of our restaurants open, however we experienced reduced sales as a result of the lockdown restrictions. In addition, the French government announced a range of measures to 38 ----- support businesses affected by COVID-19. However, due to the size of our Group, we are limited in the government aid we can receive and, even when we are able to obtain such governmental aid, its impact is usually limited. To support our franchisees throughout the evolution of these restrictions, and in order to allow our franchisees to resume their operations following the first lockdown of 2020, we agreed to implement certain temporary royalty adjustments, which resulted in reduced revenues from our franchisees during this period. Further, as lessors of the restaurant premises under our Company Restaurants and Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants, we were forced to renegotiate certain of our leases with the landlords of such restaurants as their revenues decreased during this period. See “—We are _subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amount of space, including future increases in occupancy costs” for a description of the potential long-term impacts of such exceptional lease_ renegotiations with our landlords. Despite ongoing vaccination rollouts, COVID-19 outbreaks remain prevalent around the world as new, more contagious strains of the virus emerge. Beginning at the end of July 2021, France has mandated the health pass (pass sanitaire) system, whereby individuals seeking to access a number of public locations, including as of August 9, 2021, restaurants, malls and long-distance public transportation, must provide proof of vaccination status or present a negative COVID-19 test. The initial enforcement of the health pass in August 2021 has had an initial negative impact on our sales which has since decreased. We cannot predict whether such an impact will continue in the future and there remains significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to COVID-19. For example, following the COVID-19 outbreak, the restaurant industry has experienced difficulty in recruiting and retaining employees. This challenging recruitment environment may be further burdened in the short-term by the national requirement since August 30, 2021 for all employees working in contact with the public, which includes our in-store employees, to provide their employers with a valid health pass. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results of operations will depend on the ongoing development of the virus, which is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Any future mandatory shutdowns, reductions in operations or other restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We cannot predict whether such challenging economic conditions will have any long-term effects on consumer confidence, our prices and input costs, demand for dining out experiences or volatility of raw material prices, nor can we predict if the state of the global economy will deteriorate further or when it will improve at a consistent rate. These factors may therefore continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, following the COVID-19 pandemic, most insurance companies have begun to exclude pandemics from their insurance coverage of operating losses. To the extent we renew our insurance coverage or face a subsequent pandemic, our insurance coverage of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (or other pandemics) on our operating losses would no longer be subject to coverage. Any of the foregoing risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent COVID-19 continues to adversely affect general economic conditions or our business, operations, financial condition or operating results, it may also have the effect of heightening one or several other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.

44,Final Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to Our Business,1.1.2,"We operate in a highly competitive industry, and our business and financial results may be adversely affected by actions of our competitors and our failure to respond to competitive pressures.","The restaurant industry in France is highly competitive. We compete primarily with other well-established international fast food restaurant chains and franchises (such as McDonald’s, our main 39 ----- competitor with a dominant market share), as well as other regional and local QSR restaurants on the basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service, location and the nature and condition of the restaurants in our network. The restaurant industry has few barriers to entry for opening one or numerous points of sale and therefore new competitors may emerge at any time. We may lose market share to well-established companies such as McDonald’s. Other international and national QSR chains such as KFC and Subway may also take market share as they expand in France, and new chains may enter the market. We also compete with QSR restaurants that focus on sandwiches or offer alternative menus, such as Paul, Brioche Dorée, Exki and Prêt à Manger as well as “fast casual” restaurants. Lastly, we also compete with certain segments of the food industry, such as convenience stores, delicatessens and prepared food counters in grocery stores as well as online food options from our competitors through ordering services platforms such as Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just-Eat. Our ability to compete depends on our ability to expand our network and continue to modernize and refurbish certain of our existing restaurants, develop and roll-out new products and product line extensions, effectively respond to consumer preferences, manage the complexity of our restaurant operations and franchisee network as well as the impact of our competitors’ actions, and maintain our customer’s perception of the quality and value of our products. The Burger King brand, which returned to France in 2012, is a relatively new brand compared to our main competitor, McDonald’s, which has been present in France since the 1970s and has a more established market presence, with more than three times as many restaurants and substantially greater financial resources than we do. See “—Our main competitor has a substantially larger network than we _do, and therefore we may be at a disadvantage in competing with it”._ In addition to competing for customers, we also compete for franchisees, management personnel and employees. Our competitors may be able to offer greater resources and benefits to their franchisees (for example, in terms of lower franchise royalties, advertising programs, greater training and more extensive franchise support), as well as better salaries, compensation and benefits to their management personnel and employees, all of which may enable them to attract and retain franchisees, management personnel and employees more effectively than we can. The market for suitable restaurant locations is also highly competitive and QSR companies, restaurant chains and other retail companies compete for prime real estate sites. As a result of their size advantage and/or their greater financial resources, some of our competitors may have the ability to negotiate more favorable commercial lease terms than we can, and some landlords and developers may offer priority or grant exclusivity to some of our competitors for desirable locations. As a result, we may not be able to obtain leases for new restaurants or renew leases for existing restaurants on acceptable terms, if at all, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, to the extent that one of our existing or future competitors offers items that are better priced or more appealing to consumer tastes, increases the number of restaurants it operates in one of our key markets, rebrands its restaurant portfolio to better enhance the restaurant experience or has more effective advertising and marketing programs than we do, our revenue and those of our franchisees could be adversely affected. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, lower demand for our products, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.",,,,N/A
44,Final Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to Our Business,1.1.3,"Our main competitor has a substantially larger network than we do, and therefore we may be at a disadvantage in competing with it.","Our main competitor, McDonald’s, through its French master franchisee, is a well-established branded chain and has substantially greater financial resources, higher revenue and greater economies of scale than we do. According to the NPD Group, McDonald’s had a market share of 69% in the QSHR category of the QSR segment for the first quarter of 2021 based on the SWS of burgers. Its significantly greater size may enable McDonald’s to negotiate lower prices than we can from our suppliers (for 40 ----- example, in respect of raw materials) or better absorb increases in its cost base (for example, due to inflation of raw material prices and increases in labor, rental and other operating costs). McDonald’s also has a denser network of restaurants in France than Burger King, with approximately 1,500 restaurants (as of June 2021) for McDonald’s, compared to 412 restaurants (as of June 2021) for Burger King (including 399 restaurants under the Burger King brand, 11 Quick restaurants to be converted or definitively closed in the short-term and two Quick restaurants under conversion). These competitive advantages may enable it to react to changes in pricing more quickly and more effectively than we can. McDonald’s can and does spend significantly more on advertising, marketing and other promotional activities than we do, which may give it a competitive advantage through higher levels of brand awareness among consumers. In addition, McDonald’s and other competitors may be able to deploy greater resources in order to accelerate restaurant openings and refurbishment efforts, to rapidly expand their offer of new products or to implement aggressive product discounting, all of which could give them a competitive advantage over us and could therefore adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Under challenging economic conditions, the competitive advantages resulting from greater financial resources and economies of scale may intensify, thereby permitting McDonald’s or other competitors to gain market share. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, lower demand for our products, reduced margins and revenue from Company Restaurants and royalty payments from Franchise Restaurants, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.",,,,N/A

Because our restaurants are exclusively located in France, any deterioration in the French economy could have a significant effect on our overall business, results of operations and financial condition. According to INSEE, French GDP grew at only 1.9% in 2018 and 1.8% in 2019, followed by a significant drop of 7.9% in 2020, which is mainly attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. While French GDP slightly rose in the first quarter of 2021 by 0.4%, a rebound to pre-pandemic levels may take longer than anticipated as the health crisis evolves, which could translate in a slow recovery of consumer confidence and therefore in lower consumption levels. Significant events such as sustained impact to the French economy as a result of the ongoing health crisis and political uncertainty tied to upcoming elections in France and other EU member states, could result in the implementation of strong protectionist measures and may affect the recovery of the Eurozone, including the French economy or lead to additional exits from the EU or the Eurozone. Furthermore, potential EU instability may have important consequences on our ability to obtain supplies from other EU countries at reasonable costs. A sustained economic downturn could cause our suppliers difficulty in accessing financing, which could lead to insolvency or general decline in the financial condition of our suppliers resulting in disruptions in our supplies.

For example, both Burger King’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 were adversely affected by the terrorist attacks in Paris. Such events, even when outside of France, could dampen consumer spending 41 ----- among French consumers, reduce footfall and prevent us from operating our restaurants at peak capacity or cause disruptions to our supplies. Because a significant portion of our restaurants operating costs is fixed or semi-fixed in nature, the loss of revenue following such events harms our operating margins and can result in restaurant operating losses. In addition, other developments, such as strikes, boycotts, traffic blockades, both nationally and in areas in which our restaurants operate, social and economic instability, civil disturbances, government-imposed lockdowns, or similar events, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, our operations in France were most impacted by the Yellow Vests (Gilet Jaune) protests, which caused intermittent traffic blockades and transportation disruptions, particularly in downtown areas, limiting foot traffic and access to our restaurants, during the period from roughly November 2018 through early 2019.

We do not own the Burger King brand, and we are therefore highly dependent on our franchisor, BK Europe and its ultimate parent, Burger King Corporation (“BKC”). Moreover, the Master Franchise Agreement contains certain customary undertakings, and failure to reach certain restaurant opening milestones may result in fines or early termination in certain circumstances (e.g., failure to reach pre-determined new restaurant opening targets or to pay royalties when due). If the Master Franchise Agreement were terminated, all rights granted to Burger King France under the Master Franchise Agreement (including the development rights) shall terminate, and BK Europe and/or its designee may develop, open and operate, and approve third parties to develop, open and operate, Burger King restaurants in France. As a consequence, we would not be able to continue to expand our network and realize our anticipated economies of scale as a master franchisee in France, although our rights and obligations under the then existing company franchise agreements shall remain unaffected solely by reason of such termination, and that any then existing franchise agreements (whether pure franchise or with management lease) shall remain in full force and effect and we shall be able to continue receiving payments thereunder until their respective terms. The early termination of the Master Franchise Agreement with BK Europe could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We cannot control or influence the actions of our master franchisor, and our master franchisor may take actions that could harm us. For example, BK Europe may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Certain actions taken by BK Europe, including those involving the Burger King brand, may adversely affect our business operations such as BKC requiring its franchisees to adopt a product offering that we do not believe would be popular with consumers in France. Moreover, if BK Europe does not adequately protect the Burger King brand and other intellectual property rights, our competitive position, business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Additionally, pursuant to the Master Franchise Agreement with BK Europe, we are required to comply with operational programs established by our master franchisor. For example, the Master Franchise Agreement requires that our restaurants comply with specified design criteria. In addition, our master franchisor generally has the right to require us to remodel our restaurants to conform to the then-current image of Burger King, which may require the expenditure of considerable funds. Failure to conform to these requirements could constitute a breach of the Master Franchise Agreement, which could adversely affect our competitive position, business, results of operations and financial condition. 42 ----- See “Business—Our Business—Restaurant operations—Franchise Restaurants”.",,,,N/A

However, food-borne illnesses, such as E. coli, bovine spongiform encephalopathy or “mad cow disease”, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella, and food safety issues have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future. New illnesses resistant to existing precautions or diseases with long incubation periods may develop in the future, such as mad cow disease, which could give rise to claims or allegations on a retroactive basis. Risks to the health of our customers can arise from our supply and logistics chain, which we do not control, and at our Company Restaurant and Franchise Restaurant locations. We rely on third party food suppliers, distributors, logistics and warehousing partners to supply ingredients used in the preparation of the meals we sell, including sauces, meat and fresh produce. Although such third parties are subject to regulations, including food safety and environmental regulations, such regulations may not prevent such third parties from experiencing problems related to food safety and hygiene. As a result, our reliance on third party food suppliers, distributors, logistics and warehousing partners increases the risk that food-borne illness incidents could be caused by factors outside of our control and that multiple locations would be affected rather than a single restaurant. In addition, although we maintain operational controls and provide employee and franchisee training at our Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants aimed at preventing food-borne illnesses, food tampering and other food safety issues, we can provide no assurance that these measures will be sufficient. Any report or publicity linking us, one of our franchisees or Burger King restaurants in other countries to instances of food-borne illness or other food safety issues, including food tampering or contamination, could adversely affect the Burger King brand, along with our revenue and profits. Outbreaks of disease, including influenza, or the continued emergence of COVID-19 variants, could reduce footfall in our restaurants. If customers were to become ill from food-borne or hygiene-related illnesses, we could also be forced to temporarily close some restaurants and, more significantly, the Burger King brand and reputation could be damaged, which could result in a decline in sales, thereby negatively affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, failure by any of our third party food suppliers, distributors, logistics and warehousing partners to comply with regulations, allegations of compliance failure, claims of intentional or negligent contamination of ingredients and raw materials or prolonged and intense negative publicity may disrupt their operations and result in a disruption of our food supply. Disruption of our third party food suppliers, distributors, logistics and warehousing partners’ operations could in turn reduce or impair our supply of ingredients or other raw materials, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring at restaurants of competitors could also adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition as a result of negative publicity about the foodservice industry generally. 43 ----- The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of ingredients, which could result in supply chain disruptions, significantly increasing our costs and/or lowering margins for us and our franchisees. In addition, our industry has long been subject to the threat of food tampering by suppliers, employees or guests, such as the addition of foreign objects in the food that we sell. Reports of alleged injuries caused by food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations of restaurant chains in the QSR segment and could negatively affect us in the future as well. In addition, the QSR industry is currently under heightened journalistic, legislative and regulatory scrutiny stemming from the perception that some QSR products have contributed to widespread medical problems, such as obesity and diabetes. Compliance with consumer health laws and regulations, such as those regarding the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items, may be costly and time-consuming. Additionally, if such laws and regulations change significantly, we may be required to modify or discontinue certain menu items, and we may experience higher costs associated with the implementation of those changes. We cannot make any assurances regarding our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health regulations or our ability to successfully implement the nutrient content disclosure requirements and to adapt our menu accordingly.

Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, other influential investors, lenders and other market participants are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments and consumer choices. Regardless of the industry, investors’ increased focus related to ESG and similar matters may hinder access to capital, as investors may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a result of their assessment of a company’s ESG practices. Companies which do not adapt to or comply with investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which are evolving, or which are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, may suffer from reputational damage and the business, financial condition, and/or stock price of such a company could be materially and adversely affected. We have adopted certain practices and policies to align our ESG approach with our strategy in order to deliver long-term social, environmental and economic values across our business. See “Business—ESG & Sustainability”. However, our stakeholders may look to us to implement more or different ESG procedures, standards or goals in order to continue engaging with us, to remain invested in us, or before they make further investments in us. We may also face increasing pressures from investors, lenders and other market participants, who are increasingly focused on climate change, to prioritize sustainable energy practices, reduce our carbon footprint and promote sustainability. We are also subject to evolving environmental regulations, the implementation of which may be costly and timeconsuming. See “—We are subject to health, safety and environmental regulations, which could result _in increased costs and fines, as well as the potential for damage to our reputation”. As a result, we may_ be required to implement more stringent ESG procedures or standards so that our existing and future investors and lenders remain invested in us and make further investments in us. Additionally, we may face reputational challenges in the event our ESG procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by certain constituencies or such constituencies might not be satisfied with our efforts or the speed of adoption of ESG practices or polices. If we do not meet our stakeholders’ expectations or we are not effective in addressing social and environmental responsibility matters or achieving relevant sustainability goals, trust in our brand may suffer and our business and/or our ability to access capital could be harmed. 44 ----- These limitations in both the debt and equity capital markets may affect our ability to grow as our plans for growth may include accessing such capital markets. If those markets are unavailable, or if we are unable to access alternative means of financing on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to implement our business strategy, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and may also impair our ability to service our indebtedness. Further, it is likely that we will incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report and comply with wide-ranging ESG requirements. Concurrently with the Offering, on the Issue Date we plan to enter into the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which will be a sustainability-linked financing. As a result, we will be required to maintain our sustainability targets in order to benefit from the pricing benefit associated with the sustainability-linked feature of the facility. Any failure to adhere to such targets could result in the payment of maximum amounts set forth under the terms of the financing.

Burger King France’s marketing and advertising programs must be approved by BKC, the owner of the Burger King brand. If BKC does not approve our marketing and advertising programs, we may have to develop replacement programs, which could involve additional significant costs and delay the implementation of our marketing and advertising programs. Moreover, if our marketing and advertising programs are not successful, if our competitors increase spending on advertising and promotion or if our marketing and advertising programs happen to coincide with a larger marketing and advertising program from one or more of our competitors thereby rendering our advertising program less visible or effective, we may not be able to attract new customers and retain existing customers and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Our Franchise Restaurants and Company Restaurants contribute to our advertising fund based on a percentage of their gross sales. As a result, our advertising fund expenditures depend on sales volumes at system-wide restaurants. If System-wide sales decline, there will be a reduced amount available for our marketing and advertising programs. However, because of the significant financial resources of our main competitors which have larger marketing and advertising budgets than we do, we may have to maintain a certain level of marketing and advertising expenditure (notwithstanding any decline in sales) in order to compete and maintain our exposure in the market. In such circumstances, our margins may be diminished, which will have a negative effect on our results of operations.

Brand value is partly based on consumer perceptions of a variety of subjective qualities, some of which we may have limited or no control over. Isolated or repeated events that originate from us, our franchisees or suppliers, can significantly reduce brand value and consumer trust, particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation. For example, the Burger King brand could be damaged by claims or perceptions about the quality or safety of our products or the quality of our suppliers and distributors, regardless of whether such claims or perceptions are true. Similarly, entities in our supply chain may engage in conduct, including alleged human rights abuses, that damages the Burger King brand or its 45 ----- reputation.

As such, we derive a significant portion of our revenue from Franchise Restaurants. Revenue from Franchise Restaurants consists of brand royalties and rent under Franchise with Lease Management agreements, each calculated on the basis of a percentage of sales. Consequently, our results of operations depend substantially upon our franchisees’ sales volumes. Our franchisees are independent operators and, while we can mandate certain operational standards and procedures through the enforcement of our franchise agreements, we may not be able to quickly respond to franchisees that do not uphold these standards. In addition, we cannot prevent our franchisees from incurring indebtedness or conducting other businesses that could adversely affect their financial viability, nor can we control many other factors that impact the profitability of our Franchise Restaurants. Furthermore, franchisees may be less directly interested in preserving or enhancing the Burger King brand and reputation than we are. Franchisees may operate their restaurants in a manner inconsistent with our standards and requirements, such as the cleanliness, service or quality standards set forth in our franchise agreements and manuals, or standards set by governmental laws and regulations. In addition, franchisees may fail to adequately hire and train qualified managers and other restaurant personnel. While we ultimately can terminate franchisees that do not comply with the terms and conditions of our franchise agreements, our brand and reputation may nonetheless suffer and our franchise business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The support of our franchisees is important for the success of our promotional activities and the strategic initiatives that we seek to undertake, and the successful execution of these initiatives will depend on our ability to maintain alignment with our franchisees. While we can generally mandate certain strategic initiatives through enforcement of our franchise agreements, we need the active support, as well as the managerial competence and, in certain cases, the financial ability, of our franchisees if the implementation of these initiatives is to be successful.

Leases are generally for a fixed term between nine and twelve years and feature periodic increases based on indexation clauses. In addition, market practice for leasing commercial space in certain high value areas such as central Paris requires the payment of key money to lessors and/or the former tenant. Our ability to effectively renew our existing restaurant leases or obtain restaurant leases to open new restaurants depends on the availability of locations that meet our criteria for traffic, square footage, lease economics, demographics and other factors. We may not be able to renew our existing restaurant leases on favorable terms or at all, including, for example, when the landlord is able to establish statutory grounds for non-renewal or if the leases do not have the benefit of statutory or contractual rights of renewal. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were forced to renegotiate certain of our leases with our landlords. See “—Our business, financial condition and results of _operations have been and may continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or other similar pandemics”. This renegotiation may have an impact on our future leasing transactions moving_ forward as landlords who operate in the retail space may impose higher rents or new and stringent conditions that would prevent losses like those sustained as a result of pandemic-related lease 47 ----- renegotiations. We typically occupy our restaurants under operating leases with terms of nine to twelve years. Any favorable rental rates that we are able to negotiate upon entering such leases in the years when there are high vacancy rates are not guaranteed to continue, and this may force us to pay higher rents once those leases expire or restaurants are closed in desirable locations. In addition, under French law, the maximum increases in rent imposed by law do not apply to leases with a term in excess of nine years. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, leasehold and occupancy costs represented approximately 14% of our revenue; however, as we expand our restaurant base, our lease expenses and our cash outlays for rent under the lease agreements will increase. Our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including: - requiring that a substantial portion of our available cash be applied to pay our rental obligations, thus reducing cash available for other purposes; - increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry in which we compete; and - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing. If an existing or future Company Restaurant or a Franchise with Lease Management Restaurant is not profitable and we decide to close it prior to expiration of the relevant lease, we would still be liable for the fulfillment of the obligations under the lease.

Developing and opening restaurants involve substantial risks, including the following: - the availability of and competition for suitable locations for potential development sites, the negotiation of acceptable lease terms, and delays in obtaining construction permits and in completion of construction; - the impact of local tax, zoning, land use and environmental rules and regulations on our ability and the ability of our franchisees to develop restaurants, and the impact of any material difficulties or failures that we and our franchisees experience in obtaining the necessary licenses and approvals for new restaurants; - changes in governmental rules, regulations and interpretations; - the availability of financing, at acceptable rates and terms, to both franchisees and third party landlords, for restaurant development; - employing and training qualified personnel; - securing acceptable suppliers; - developed properties not achieving desired revenue or cash flow levels once opened; and - general economic and business conditions. 50 ----- There is no assurance that we, whether through Company Restaurants or Franchise Restaurants, will be able to successfully open new restaurants or that such restaurants will generate strong sales or profits. New restaurants may be located in areas where we have little or no meaningful operating experience and, in such instances, we typically have to rely on the expertise and local knowledge of our local partners.

On May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the “GDPR”) on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data came into effect. The GDPR obligates EU-based companies or companies that process personal data about EU subjects (either as “data controllers” or as “data processors”) to comply with a large number of obligations, which relate for example to (i) the processing of personal data including transparency, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, security, and confidentiality; (ii) the ability of the controller to demonstrate compliance with such principles (accountability); (iii) the obligation to identify a legal basis before the processing; and (iv) rights of data subjects, such as, among others, transparency, right of access, right to rectification, or right to erasure. In spite of our continued efforts to comply with the GDPR and similar regulations, we also face the risk that customer data that we collect may be stolen or misappropriated. Our customers may be discouraged from providing us with their data and our business could be negatively affected as a result. Under such circumstances, our regulation, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. As a data controller, we could face legal actions in the absence of compliance with GDPR. In addition, we could also face legal action in the absence of compliance of a third party processing personal data on our behalf. Given that we and/or third parties, on our behalf, process certain sensitive information, we are subject to specific processing conditions and have taken steps to ensure compliance with these conditions. The GDPR obligates companies to implement a number of formal processes and policies to review and document the privacy implications of the development, acquisition, or use of all new products, technologies, or types of data. The GDPR provides for substantial fines for breaches of data protection requirements, which can be up to 4.0% of the annual worldwide revenue of the preceding 53 ----- financial year or €20.0 million, particularly in the event of a breach of the conditions applicable to consent and/or related to data subjects’ rights. A fine may be imposed instead of, or in addition to, measures that may be ordered by supervisory authorities (such as the request to cease any processing). The GDPR, the national implementing legislation, i.e., the French data protection rules and French law in general, also provide for a private right of action on data subjects for breaches of data protection requirements and additional private enforcement mechanisms. For instance, the French supervisory authority may issue a public warning, as part of a control revealing infringements of the applicable data protection regulation, and in parallel a public formal order to comply with the applicable regulation.

Media reports relating to any of these topics, even when not involving us, could reduce demand for our products and could result in a decrease in customer footfall in our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types. In particular, with respect to social media, consumers value readily available information concerning the industry and market segments in which we operate, and often act on such information without further investigation, authentication and without regard to the accuracy of such information. The availability of information on social media platforms and devices is virtually immediate as is its impact.

Negative claims or publicity involving us, our brand or our products, or the production methods of any of our suppliers, could seriously damage our reputation and brand image, regardless of whether such claims or publicity are accurate. Our social media presence amplifies consumer engagement with our brand but comes with less control due to consumer comments and hashtags compared to more traditional public relations and marketing methods, which could associate the brand with content or views, which are not aligned with our values.

We cannot guarantee that such interpretations will not be questioned by the relevant tax authorities, which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Tax laws and regulations are subject to change, and new laws and regulations may make it difficult to restructure our operations in an advantageous manner.

Furthermore, we may record deferred tax assets on our balance sheet, reflecting future tax savings resulting from discrepancies between the tax and accounting valuation of the assets and liabilities or in respect of tax loss carry-forwards from our entities. The actual realization of these assets in future years depends on tax laws and regulations, the outcome of potential tax audits and the future results of the relevant entities.

Changes in tax laws or regulations or to their interpretations could adversely affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments. In particular, European and French tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and are subject to varying interpretations. For example, the current implementation into French tax law of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (the “OECD”) principles related to base erosions and profit shifting (“BEPS”) included in the final reports released by the OECD as well as the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS signed in Paris on June 7, 2017, may increase the administrative efforts within our business and impact existing structures. Furthermore, the European Union continues to harmonize the tax legislation of the Member States. In this respect, the Council of the European Union (the “Council of the European Union”) adopted a directive “laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market” on July 12, 2016 (Council Directive 2016/1164) (the “ATAD”). The ATAD was later amended on May 29, 2017, by the Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 (the “ATAD **II”), which, inter _alia, extends the scope of the ATAD to hybrid mismatches involving third countries and provides that_ its provisions shall apply (subject to certain exceptions), as from January 1, 2020.

Such new rules apply since January 1, 2019, following their transposition into French tax law by Article 34 of the French Finance Law for 2019 (Law 2018-1317 of December 28, 2018) (the “French Finance",,,,N/A

Our franchisees who have entered into such agreements to operate one or several Burger King restaurants may be unwilling or unable to renew their franchise agreements with us for a number of reasons, including low sales volumes, high rental costs, lack of profitability or a desire to retire. If our franchisees cannot, or decide not to, renew their franchise agreements with us, we will have to find a replacement franchisee to operate their restaurants or otherwise operate them as Company Restaurants. If a substantial number of franchises are not renewed, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 46 ----- Further, the European Commission is currently contemplating amendments to its Regulation (EU) 330/2010, Vertical Block Exemption Regulation, (the ""VBER"") which provides parameters for businesses entering into vertical agreements and published for public consultation a draft VBER and draft revised guidelines on vertical restraints (the “Vertical Guidelines”) on July 9, 2021. The proposed amendments, provide that an exemption of Article 101 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union shall apply to vertical agreements, in the event competing supplier and buyer have an aggregated market share, which does not exceed 10% in the relevant market at retail level. In the event competing supplier and buyer have an aggregated market share exceeding 10% (and not above 30%), the exemption shall also apply, except for exchange of information between the parties. Such amendments, if adopted, would necessarily concern franchisors. Indeed, whilst engaging in dual distribution is not prohibited, specific attention should be given to the way a “supplier” who has set up a dual distribution system operates, in particular regarding the exchange of information with distribution partners. To address these concerns, the European Commission already proposed to make some adjustments to the existing safe harbor for dual distribution. Following the publication of the draft VBER and draft Vertical Guidelines, most of the parties expressed the view that “franchising” should be more precisely defined at the EU level and in the context of the VBER, so as to mitigate the possible effects of the contemplated amendments on informationsharing in the franchise system. The timeline for the final adoption of the revised VBER and Vertical Guidelines is now expected on June 1, 2022. In the event the amendments would pass as proposed, without further clarification, we will need to potentially modify our sharing of certain sensitive information across our network and, if necessary, pass the exemption test. Such amendments, if adopted, should be taken into consideration for our franchise network, if the latter qualifies as a dual distribution system where a “supplier” not only sells its goods or services through independent distributors (such as retailers) but also directly to end customers in direct competition with its independent distributors. In the event the market share threshold is met, adequate measures, such as Chinese walls, would need to be implemented in franchise networks, including ours, to frame the exchange of competitively sensitive information (such as prices, customers or sales volumes) with distribution partners, which are competitors on the retail level. If adopted, such amendments could create an area of legal uncertainty and require burdensome internal procedures that could be detrimental to the development of franchised brands. Such difficulties could have the impact of dissuading us or our franchisees from using our existing distribution model, which could negatively impact the size of our franchise network, and as a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition",,,,N/A

Under Article 212 I-(a) of the French Tax Code, interest incurred on loans granted by related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code is deductible up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate referred to in Article 39-1-3° of the French Tax Code or, if higher, up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate that the borrowing entity could have obtained from independent financial credit institutions in similar circumstances. In addition, France has implemented the ATAD regarding in particular interest deductibility limitations and the ATAD II regarding hybrid mismatches with third countries. Pursuant to the ATAD, codified in particular under Article 212 bis of the French Tax Code, the deductibility of net financial expenses incurred by an entity in respect of a given fiscal year is limited to the higher of (i) €3 million and (ii) 30% of its adjusted EBITDA in the same fiscal year (corresponding to its taxable income before offset of carry forward tax losses and without taking into consideration net financial expenses and, to some extent, depreciation, provisions and capital gains/losses) generated by such entity (the “30% Limitation”). Such limitation applies to both related-party and third-party financings regardless of the purpose of these financings, subject to certain limited exceptions.

Where the amount of the related party debt of a company exceeds a ratio equal to 1.5 time the company’s equity, the deduction of net financial expenses borne by such entity is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 30% of its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €3 million, multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by non-related parties (directly or indirectly) within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code increased by 1.5 time the company’s equity (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said year. The balance of net financial expenses is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 10% of its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €1 million multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by related parties (directly or indirectly) within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code exceeding 1.5 time the company’s own funds (assessed either at the beginning or on the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said fiscal year. However, the interest deductibility limitation provided for by these amended thin-capitalization rules does not apply if the borrowing company demonstrates that the overall debt-to-equity ratio of the group, as determined under accounting consolidation rules, to which it belongs is higher than or equal to its own debt-to-equity ratio. Financial expenses that are disallowed pursuant to the 30% Limitation can be carried forward indefinitely and deducted in the future under the same conditions. On the other hand, the portion of financial expenses which tax deduction is disallowed as a result of the application of the €1 million threshold or 10% limitation is only eligible for carry-forward for one-third of its amount. The unused interest deduction capacity of a current fiscal year may also be used over the five following fiscal years, but only against financial expenses incurred in respect of those fiscal years, it being noted that this measure is not available to thinly capitalized entities. Specific rules apply to companies that belong to French tax consolidated groups, i.e., mainly (i) the 30% Limitation is computed on the basis of the consolidated adjusted EBITDA generated by such companies and (ii) the 1.5 debt-to-own funds ratio is analyzed (x) on a consolidated basis pursuant to French accounting rules applying for purposes of establishing consolidated financial statements and (y) in respect of loans granted by related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code which do not belong to the same tax consolidated group. The ATAD II, applicable as from January 1, 2020 (except for certain of its provisions which will be applicable as from January 1, 2022) and codified under Articles 205 B et seq. of the French Tax Code provide limitations on interest deductions in the event of (i) a deduction of a payment at the level of a paying entity without a corresponding inclusion of such payment in the taxable income of the receiving entity (referred to as a “deduction without inclusion”) or (ii) a deduction of the same payment, operational expenses or losses in the taxable income of both the paying and receiving entity (referred to as a “double deduction”). Such limitations only apply to payments taking place between “associated enterprises”, except for the so-called “structured arrangements” (i.e., an arrangement pricing the relevant mismatch or an arrangement designed to produce the mismatch, subject to certain conditions). If the hybrid mismatch results in a deduction without inclusion, the deduction from taxable income will generally be denied to the French paying entity. Alternatively, the payment to a French receiving entity will be included in its taxable income if deduction is not denied in the jurisdiction of the paying entity. If the hybrid mismatch results in a double deduction, the deduction will either be denied at the level of the receiving entity or at the level of the paying entity. In respect of fiscal years opened as from January 1, 2022, these provisions also cover reverse hybrid entities, referring to situations where an entity is deemed to be tax transparent by the Member State in which it is incorporated or established and the jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which its “associated enterprises” (i.e., entities holding directly or indirectly in aggregate an interest in 50% or more of its 59 ----- voting rights, capital interests or rights to share profit) are established, qualify the entity as nontransparent. Where such a hybrid entity is incorporated or established in France, its income is, as the case may be, either subject to French corporate income tax at its own level or taxable pursuant to Article 8 of the French Tax Code at the level of its partners or shareholders, to the extent that it is not taxed in another State. The above-mentioned tax rules may limit our ability to deduct interest accrued on our indebtedness incurred in France and may thus increase our tax burden, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and reduce the cash flow available to service our indebtedness.",,,,N/A

The French Finance Law for 2020 (Law 2019-1479 of December 28, 2019) (the “French Finance Law for 2020”) also introduced under French tax law the provisions of the ATAD II and thus",1.3.2,,"repealed the existing French anti-hybrid rules, as set forth in Article 212-I-b of the French Tax Code. See “—French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a portion _of the interest incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to service our indebtedness” for_ more details on this rule. In addition, Article 108 of the French Finance Law for 2019 introduced under French tax law, the anti-abuse provision provided for by the ATAD with respect to French corporate income tax, which aims to address abusive tax practices that are not dealt with by specifically targeted provisions. Pursuant to this provision, the French tax authorities may ignore an arrangement, or a series of arrangements, which, having been put into place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the applicable tax law, are not genuinely taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances. The European Commission also published a corporate reform package proposal on October 25, 2016, including three new proposals that aim at (i) relaunching the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (“CCCTB”) which is a single set of rules to compute companies’ taxable profits in the EU, (ii) avoiding loopholes associated with profit-shifting for tax between EU countries and non-EU countries, and (iii) providing new dispute resolution rules to relieve problems with double taxation for businesses. The directive proposal on the CCCTB requires unanimity in the Council of the European Union for its adoption following consultation of the European Parliament (special legislative procedure), which gave its favorable vote on March 15, 2018. More recently, in a communication to the European Parliament and the Council of May 18, 2021 and denominated “Business Taxation for the 21[st] Century”, the European Commission has announced additional measures in the field of corporate taxation to take into account the evolution of the context of the EU business taxation policy. In particular, the European Commission announced that it will propose a new framework for income taxation for businesses in Europe (“Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation” or “BEFIT”) that will replace the pending proposals under the CCCTB. BEFIT will be a single corporate tax rulebook for the EU and will 57 ----- consist in consolidating the profits of the EU members of a multinational group into a single tax base, which will then be allocated to Member States using a formula and be taxed at national corporate income tax rates. The preparation for this new proposal will be carried out by the European Commission alongside the Member States and the European Parliament and will give rise to consultations with the business sector and civil society groups. Alongside BEFIT, the European Commission also announced, among other things, that it would (i) table a legislative proposal setting out union rules to neutralize the misuse of shell entities for tax purposes, (ii) adopt a recommendation on the domestic treatment of losses and (iii) make a legislative proposal creating a Debt Equity Bias Reduction Allowance (“DEBRA”). Furthermore, new rules on tax dispute resolution already apply since January 1, 2019, following the transposition of Council Directive 2017/1852 of October 10, 2017 into French tax law as part of the French Finance Law for 2019. These new regulations could impact our tax position in the future. Our tax returns are prepared in accordance with applicable tax legislation and prevailing case law. Certain tax positions we take are based on industry practice, tax advice we have received in some cases from third parties (including legal counsel), and similarities to facts and circumstances described in case law. These positions may relate to tax compliance (especially in the current international tax context tending towards enhanced mandatory disclosure obligations), classification of income, treaty relief and withholding tax, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues, including tax base. It is possible that the tax authorities will not agree with the views we have taken. From time to time, we are subject to tax audits, and any challenges from relevant tax authorities with respect to our application and interpretation of tax rules may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, and such adjustments may not be favorable to us. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor, they could result in significant additional tax liabilities and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A

Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA is not intended to be a projection, estimate or guarantee of performance regarding Adjusted EBITDA generation for the year ending December 31, 2021 which may be affected by definitive closures of Quick restaurants, the phasing of the novelty effect and the pace of conversions (including temporary closures for conversion). Moreover, prospective investors should note that the additional Adjusted EBITDA modeled by Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA for new restaurant openings and conversions may be offset, to a degree that will vary on the circumstances, by a number of factors. Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA is subject to significant business, economic, financial and competitive risks and uncertainties that could have caused actual results to differ materially. Such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to: - the impact of the novelty effect for new Burger King restaurants discussed under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of _Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Evolution of our network”_ and whether this has been sufficiently accounted for in our assumptions; - estimates and assumptions regarding demand by customers visiting our increased number of restaurants; and - assumptions regarding the absence of increases in our fixed costs resulting from the operation of additional Company Restaurants during such period. Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA and the underlying calculations have not been audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA is included in this Listing Prospectus because we believe that it provides a useful indication of what our Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended August 31, 2021 would have been under certain circumstances and assumptions as described herein; however, this information does not constitute a measure of financial performance under IFRS, and you should not consider Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with IFRS or as a measure of our results of operations or liquidity. Although we believe the estimates and assumptions we have used to calculate Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA are reasonable and are based either on historical experience and our knowledge of the marketplace, investors should not place undue reliance upon any of these calculations, as underlying estimates and assumptions could differ from what would have been our actual results of operations if all Burger King restaurants in operation or under conversion as of August 31, 2021 had been operational for the twelve months ended August 31, 2021. In addition, our results of operations that are ultimately achieved with the conversion in accordance with our strategy could differ from the model of Adjusted Run-rate EBITDA presented herein.

The New Revolving Credit Facility and the SSN Indenture allow the PIK Issuer’s subsidiaries to utilize amounts that would otherwise be available to pay dividends to the PIK Issuer for other purposes, and such uses would reduce the amount of cash available to pay dividends to the PIK Issuer in order to pay cash interest on the PIK Notes. The terms of the PIK Notes offered hereby will not restrict the ability of the PIK Issuer’s subsidiaries to use their restricted payment capacity for such alternative purposes. See “Description of the PIK Notes—Certain Covenants.” As a result, there can be no assurance that the PIK Issuer will (or will be able to) make payments on the PIK Notes in cash. The payment of interest through an increase in the principal amount of the outstanding PIK Notes or the issuance of additional Notes would increase the amount of the PIK Issuer’s indebtedness and would increase the risks associated with the PIK Issuer’s level of indebtedness.",,,,N/A

The holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indentures) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral. Under French law the pledgee of a French law security interest and the creditor of the claim secured by such security interest are required to be the same person and such security interest cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as fiduciary (fiduciaire) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agent (agent des sûretés) under Articles 2488-6 et seq. of the French Civil Code. The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the PIK Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuers and the SSN Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indentures (the “Principal Obligations”). Although the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recognized, in a decision on parallel debt mechanisms (Cass. com. 13 September 2011 n°10-25.533 _Belvédère) relating to bond documentation governed by New York law, the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a parallel debt, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a parallel debt claim. There is no certainty that the parallel debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent as Parallel Debt Creditor under the parallel debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt. The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Indentures that become particularly important following Defaults or Events of Default, and acts in a fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the holders of the Notes. The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. 13 September 2011 n°10-25533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of 1[st] July 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will, subject to certain limited exceptions, act to enforce the security interests in the SSN Collateral and take instructions from the relevant secured creditors in respect of the SSN Collateral only at the direction of the “instructing group”. Subject to certain exceptions described below and in further detail in the section entitled “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement,” among other things, the “majority pari passu creditors” (generally, creditors representing the simple majority of, among other things, the outstanding principal amount under the Senior Secured Notes and any pari passu secured indebtedness) shall constitute an instructing group and shall have the right to instruct the Security Agent as to the enforcement of the SSN Collateral, provided that such instructions are consistent with the “enforcement principles” set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. If, however: - the majority pari passu creditors have not either: (i) made a determination as to the method of enforcement and notified the Security Agent of that determination; or (ii) appointed a financial adviser to assist them in making such a determination, in each case, within three months of the date on which an instructing group delivers a copy of their proposed enforcement instructions (the “initial notice”); or - the “super senior discharge date” (as described in the section below entitled “Description _of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”) has not occurred within six_ months of the date of the initial notice; or - an insolvency event is continuing with respect to a member of the Group; or - the majority pari passu creditors have not either: (i) made a determination as to the method of enforcement and notified the Security Agent of that determination; or (ii) appointed a financial adviser to assist them in making a determination, and the “majority super senior creditors” (as described below): (a) determine in good faith that a delay in issuing enforcement instructions could have a material adverse effect on the ability to effect a distressed disposal or on the expected realization proceeds of any enforcement; and (b) deliver enforcement instructions they believe to be consistent with the enforcement principles before the Security Agent has received instructions from the majority pari passu creditors; then the Security Agent shall, instead follow the instructions that are subsequently given by the “majority super senior creditors” (generally, creditors representing more than 66.67% of the aggregate of all unpaid and undrawn commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility and the termination value or assumed termination value of certain hedging liabilities), provided that such instructions are consistent with the “enforcement principles” set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. The foregoing security enforcement arrangements could be disadvantageous to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes in a number of respects. Disputes may occur between the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and creditors under our New Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to the relevant hedging obligations or holders of any permitted additional indebtedness as to the appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement remedies and strategies with respect to the SSN Collateral securing such obligations. In such an event, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be bound by any decisions of the instructing group, which may result in enforcement action in respect of the relevant collateral, whether or not such action is approved by the holders of the Senior Secured Notes or may 69 ----- be adverse to such noteholders. The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the enforcement sale of any SSN Collateral will be subject to, as a condition to the release of any claims of any other indebtedness secured by such collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement, certain protections intended to maximize the cash recovery from an enforcement sale. The creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to certain hedging obligations or the holders of any permitted additional indebtedness may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Senior Secured Notes and they may elect to pursue their remedies under the relevant security documents at a time when it would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to do so. In addition, other creditors not party to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence enforcement actions against the SSN Issuer or its subsidiaries, the SSN Issuer or one or more of its subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain SSN Collateral could otherwise be impaired or reduced in value. In addition, if we incur substantial additional indebtedness which may be secured by security interests in the SSN Collateral, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not constitute the requisite majority of pari passu creditors for the purposes of instructing the Security Agent.

In France, the enforcement of the SSN Guarantees and the security interests in the SSN Collateral will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured over such SSN Collateral, as applicable, under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such a SSN Guarantee or security interest in the SSN Collateral is not in the grantor’s corporate interests, or the burden of such security interest exceeds the benefit to the relevant grantor, or such guarantee or security interest would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and would cause the directors of such subsidiary grantor, in certain jurisdictions, to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. In France, the liabilities and obligations under the SSN Guarantees and the security interests in the SSN Collateral are subject to (i) certain exceptions, including any obligations which, if incurred, would constitute prohibited financial assistance within the meaning of Article L.225-216 of the French _Code de Commerce or infringement of the provisions of Articles L.242-6 or L.244-1 of the French Code de Commerce; and (ii) a financial limitation corresponding to an amount equal to the proceeds from the_ offering of the Senior Secured Notes which the Issuers have applied for the direct benefit of each French Guarantor through intercompany loans. By virtue of this limitation, each French Guarantor’s obligations under the SSN Guarantees and the security interests in the SSN Collateral could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes or a French SSN Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under the SSN Guarantee and the security interest in the SSN Collateral. French law requires that, when a French company grants a guarantee of third-party obligations, the 70 ----- guarantee must be in the corporate purpose and corporate interest of the guarantor company. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance.

Under French law, pledges over assets may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) in connection with a judicial process (x) by way of a sale of the pledged assets in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (y) by way of the judicial attribution (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) by way of non-judicial private attribution (pacte commissoire) of the pledged assets to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged assets. Enforcement by way of private sale may not be agreed at the time of granting of the security, and therefore, holders of the Notes will not benefit from such enforcement method. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of attribution (whether judicial attribution or private attribution), the secured liabilities will be deemed extinguished up to the value of the attributed assets. Such value is determined either by the judge in the context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed or court appointed expert in the context of a private attribution. In any event, if the value of the pledged assets exceeds the amount of the secured liabilities, the secured creditors will be required to pay the pledgor a “soulte” equal to the difference between the value of the pledged assets and the amount of the secured liabilities. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditors from a subsequent sale of the Collateral. Consequently, in the event that the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the holders of the Notes are entitled to, and decide to, enforce the Collateral, as the case may be, which consists of a pledge over the shares of each Issuer, through judicial or private foreclosure, and the value of such shares exceeds the amount of the secured debt, the holders of the Notes may be required to pay immediately to the relevant pledgors a “soulte” equal to the amount by which the value of such shares exceeds the amount of the secured debt. If the value of such shares is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such shares, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured. Alternatively, the holders of the Notes could decide to undertake the sale of the pledged shares by public auction. As public auction procedures are not designed for a sale of a business as a going concern, however, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the group as a going concern.",,,,N/A

The SSN Collateral will also secure on a first-ranking basis our obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations. In addition, the PIK Indenture allows the incurrence of certain additional permitted debt that is secured by the PIK Collateral, and the SSN Collateral may also secure additional debt to 71 ----- the extent permitted by the terms of the SSN Indenture, the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Intercreditor Agreement.

Not all of the respective Issuers’ assets will secure, directly or indirectly, the Notes. The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, the condition of the French economy and the availability of buyers. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, there can be no assurance that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in its liquidation.

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens, loss of legal perfection and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or characterization under the laws of France. The security interests will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. The Issuers cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. The Issuers also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

If a change of control were to occur, there can be no assurance that the Issuers would have sufficient funds available at such time to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or, in the case of the SSN Issuer, that the restrictions in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or the SSN Issuer's other contractual obligations would allow the SSN Issuer to make such required purchases. A change of control may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of the Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility and any other indebtedness that the Issuers have incurred or may incur in the future. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under any indebtedness that the Issuers have incurred or may incur in the future (including, in the case of the Senior Secured Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility), even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuers to receive cash from their subsidiaries to allow them to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control may be limited by the Group's then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when the Issuers’ subsidiaries are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuers for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, the Issuers’ subsidiaries may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to fund the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuers will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, the Issuers expect that they would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. There can be no assurance that the Issuers would be able to obtain such financing. The Issuers’ failure to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the respective Indentures, which could, in turn, constitute a default under certain other indebtedness. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes— _Purchase of Senior Secured Notes upon a Change of Control” and “Description of the PIK Notes— Purchase of PIK Notes upon a Change of Control”._ 74 ----- The change of control provision contained in the Indentures may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring or other similar refinancings involving the Issuer that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “change of control” as defined in the Indentures. Except as described under “Description of _the Senior Secured Notes—Purchase of Senior Secured Notes upon a Change of Control” and_ “Description of the PIK Notes—Purchase of PIK Notes upon a Change of Control”, the Indentures will not contain provisions that would require the Issuers to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, recapitalization or similar refinancing. The definition of “change of control” in the Indentures will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of each Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, as applicable, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular refinancing would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of each of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole.

Under the BH Cash_ Management Agreement, the SSN Issuer advances to BH a portion of its cash on balance sheet to facilitate the deposit of such cash with certain financial institutions on its behalf in order to optimize its cash management and increase the return on its cash investments. BH can only invest this cash in liquid and risk-free financial instruments. The SSN Issuer’s consolidated free cash is subject to this arrangement. All funds the SSN Issuer advances to BH, and all securities purchased with such funds, and proceeds of all of the foregoing, are deposited in segregated accounts in the name of BH, and these accounts are pledged to the SSN Issuer to secure BH’s obligations under the BH Cash Management Agreement.

Moreover, even though the Security Agent can, on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of Senior Secured Notes, enforce the pledge of the SSN Issuer’s receivables under the BH Cash Management Agreement, thereby giving it a direct claim against BH on behalf of the holders of Senior Secured Notes, its ability to enforce this direct claim would be similarly adversely affected under such circumstances. Therefore, if BH were to become subject to insolvency proceedings, the SSN Issuer’s ability to access the cash and other property held by BH on our behalf may be legally blocked, and the amount of such cash and other property may be significant. Moreover, neither of the Issuers control BH, and, since BH is not in the restricted group under the Indentures or the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, it is not subject to the covenants set out therein.

The Senior Secured Notes will bear a variable rate based on the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (""EURIBOR""), plus an applicable margin, and the New Revolving Credit Facility bears a variable rate based on the EURIBOR, plus an applicable margin. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Senior Secured Notes. Neither the SSN Indenture nor the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contain a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. The European Money Markets Institute (“EMMI”, the administrator of EURIBOR) announced in 2020 that measures needed to be undertaken by the end of 2021 to reform EURIBOR to ensure continued publication and compliance with E.U. Benchmarks Regulation, such regulation having been implemented into EU law in order to address perceived weaknesses in the admininstration of benchmarks and entering into force on June 30, 2016 (subject to certain transitional provisions). EMMI has subsequently confirmed that it is compliant with the E.U. Benchmarks Regulation. However, there can be no guarantee that subsequent changes in regulatory guidance, industry standards or market practice could result in further changes to way in which EURIBOR, LIBOR or EURIBOR replacement 78 ----- rates or mechanisms or other risk-free rates are drafted, implemented or interpreted.

Any such change could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest.

Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investors measure the return on their investments.

In each of our markets, our restaurants compete with a large number of national and regional restaurant chains, as well as locally owned restaurants. We compete primarily with other well-established restaurant franchisors operating in the QSR or CDR space (such as Yum!, Napaqaro, Le Duff, McDonald’s and Holder) on the basis of the quality and strength of our franchise network and the quality of restaurant brands within our portfolios (measured on the basis of product choice, food quality, affordability, service offered, location and condition of restaurant network). The vitality of our brand portfolio is closely tied to our ability to attract and retain franchisees to operate the restaurants in our brand portfolio who are not only qualified, but also motivated to uphold the standards we set for our brands. These franchisees are the linchpin of our network, playing a crucial role in delivering the quality and service that customers expect from our brands. We face competition in attracting and retaining qualified and motivated franchisees to operate the restaurants in our brand portfolio. Our competitors may be able to offer greater resources and benefits to their franchisees (for example, in terms of lower franchise royalties, advertising programs, greater training and more extensive franchise support), which may enable them to attract and retain franchisees more effectively than we can. Further, our competitors’ size, resources and business model may allow them to better deploy their strategic initiatives across their franchisee network (including across the areas of marketing, product development and overall quality of operations). In addition to competing on the basis of the strength of our franchise network, our food service competitors may have well-integrated, developed and high-quality international, national or regional QSR and/or CDR restaurant chains in their portfolios, which could draw our customers to their restaurants, negatively impacting the performance of the restaurant brands within our portfolio. We carefully select the restaurant brands in our portfolios to address specific QSR and CDR consumer preferences. While the strategic diversity of the brands in our portfolio is intended to protect us from being significantly exposed to the financial performance of any one of our individual brands, we are still subject to the risk that any one of our restaurant brands may lose market share to well established companies or new entrants, which could have an impact on our financial performance. For example, Burger King, the largest restaurant brand in our portfolio, competes predominantly with McDonald’s, which has a substantially larger and denser network in France. McDonald’s, through its French master franchisee, is a well-established branded chain that has substantially greater financial resources, higher revenue and greater economies of scale than Burger King does. This significantly greater size may enable McDonald’s to negotiate lower prices than Burger King can from its suppliers (for example, in respect of raw 36 ----- materials) or better absorb increases in its cost base (for example, due to inflation of raw material prices and increases in labor, rental and other operating costs). McDonald’s also spends significant amounts on advertising, marketing and other promotional activities, which may give it a competitive advantage through higher levels of brand awareness among consumers. In addition, McDonald’s and other QSR competitors may be able to deploy greater resources in order to accelerate restaurant openings and refurbishment efforts, to rapidly expand their offer of new products or to implement aggressive product discounting, all of which could give it a competitive advantage over Burger King. Under challenging economic conditions, the competitive advantages resulting from greater financial resources and economies of scale may intensify, thereby permitting McDonald’s or other competitors to gain market share. If Burger King is unable to maintain its competitive position, it could experience reduced royalty payments from franchise restaurants, as well as reduced margins and revenue from company restaurants, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The restaurant industry has few barriers to entry for opening one or numerous points of sale and therefore new restaurant brands may emerge at any time, competing with the restaurant brands in our portfolio. Existing international and national chains may also take market share as they strengthen their position and expand their points of sale in France. Further, we also compete with certain segments of the food industry, such as convenience stores, delicatessens and prepared food counters in grocery stores, as well as online food options from our competitors through ordering services platforms such as Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just-Eat. Existing competition is intensified by these delivery aggregators and food delivery service providers, which give consumers convenient access to a broad range of competing restaurant chains and food retailers. The rapid evolution of the competitive landscape, particularly in light of the growing popularity of online food ordering and delivery platforms, requires a commitment to continued innovation. The location of our restaurants has significant influence on their success, and therefore the market for suitable restaurant locations is highly competitive and QSR and CDR companies, restaurant chains and other retail companies compete for prime real estate sites. We cannot assure you that current locations will continue to be economically viable or that additional locations can be acquired at reasonable costs. In addition, the economic environment where restaurants are located could decline in the future, which could result in reduced sales for those locations. We cannot assure you that new sites will be profitable or as profitable as existing sites. Under our existing Company Restaurant and Franchise with Lease Management models, we continue to lease locations for restaurant sites across all of our brands (see “—We are subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amount _of space, including future increases in occupancy costs”). As a result of their size advantage and/or their greater_ financial resources, some of our competitors may have the ability to negotiate more favorable commercial lease terms than we can, which could reduce our margins, and some landlords and developers may offer priority or grant exclusivity to some of our competitors for desirable locations, which could increase their competitive edge. As a result, we may not be able to obtain leases for new restaurant brands in our portfolio or renew leases for existing restaurants on acceptable terms, if at all, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to compete depends on our ability to expand our franchise restaurant network (either through existing franchisees opening new restaurants or by attracting new franchisees) and to strengthen and continue to develop the quality and value of the restaurant brands within our portfolio, by in turn developing and rolling out new products and product line extensions, executing successfully advertising and marking programs, effectively responding to consumer preferences and managing the complexity of restaurant operations. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience a loss of quality franchisees in our network, downward pressure on prices, lower demand for the products offered by our restaurant brands, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.",,,,N/A

As all of the restaurants within our portfolio are currently concentrated in France, we have a heightened exposure to local economic conditions. As a result, any deterioration in the French economy could have a significant effect on our overall business, results of operations and financial condition. According to INSEE, French GDP grew by 6.4% in 2021 (reflecting a rebound from the significant decrease in GDP in 2020 as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic), 2.5% in 2022 and 0.9% in 2023. While French GDP demonstrated growth over recent years, this growth could be attributed to recovered consumer confidence following the extreme deterioration of GDP during the COVID-19 pandemic, and may not be sustainable. There is no guarantee that GDP will continue its upward trajectory if this growth plateaus, stabilizing to pre-pandemic levels, or if other macro-economic trends bear a negative impact on future periods. Further, a global economic downturn or other worldwide geopolitical events may also have an adverse impact on consumer confidence in France. Recent examples of such events include the COVID-19 pandemic, which spurred a global economic downturn that negatively impacted consumer confidence and fostered more price conscious spending, including in France. In addition, beginning in 2022, the Russian-Ukrainian war has resulted in threats to the development of the global economy, including by way of increasing inflationary pressures that have an impact on consumer spending. Recent hostilities in the Middle East could also have a significant negative impact on the global economic outlook, which could in turn impact the individual consumption decisions of our customers in France. Any significant deterioration in current macroeconomic conditions, particularly those which have a negative impact in France, could have an adverse effect on our business, growth prospects, financial conditions, or results of operations.",,,,N/A

Such events, even when outside of France, could dampen consumer spending among French consumers, reduce footfall and prevent the restaurants in our brand portfolio from operating at peak capacity or cause disruptions to our supplies. Because a significant portion of restaurant operating costs are fixed or semi-fixed in nature, the loss of revenue following such events harms our operating margins and can result in operating losses. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic compelled us and our franchisees to adjust restaurant operations, manage customer flow, and enhance delivery and pickup services, with supply chain disruptions causing potential delays and shortages. These changes, along with a lasting shift in consumer preferences towards delivery services, could have enduring effects on our industry, business, results of operations, and financial condition. To support our franchisees throughout the evolution of COVID-19 restrictions, we agreed to implement certain temporary royalty adjustments, which resulted in reduced revenues from our franchisees during this period. Further, as lessors of the restaurant premises under our Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants, we were forced to renegotiate certain of our leases with the landlords of such restaurants as their revenues decreased during this period. We cannot guarantee that we will not need to provide similar support in the future to maintain operations during unforeseen events. In addition, other developments, such as strikes, boycotts, traffic blockades, both nationally and in areas in which the restaurants in our portfolio operate, social and economic instability, civil disturbances, government-imposed lockdowns, or similar events, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, between November 2018 through January 2021, our operations in France were adversely impacted by the Gilets Jaunes (Yellow Vests) protest movement in France, which caused intermittent traffic blockades and transportation disruptions, particularly in downtown areas, limiting foot traffic and access to restaurants in certain peak urban areas. More recently, in early 2024, agricultural unions in France organized a series of protests and 38 ----- road blockades on major roads in France. While such protests have largely diminished in response to government concessions, any such future protect could pose a risk to our supply chain continuity and restaurant operations. Any continued or resurgent social and political uncertainty may expose us to greater risks of interruption of our operations. Further, our security costs may rise and footfall in our stores may suffer as a result of any adjacent incidents of social unrest or violence. We cannot accurately predict the extent to which such events may affect us, directly or indirectly, in the future. Prolonged disruptions of our operations due to natural disasters, civil unrest or other catastrophic events, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Although we have insurance policies in place, we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage with respect to natural disasters, civil unrest, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events and any losses that could result from such events in the future. Terrorist attacks in France and abroad, as well as war and threats of war or actual conflicts involving France or other countries, may dramatically and adversely impact the economy of France and cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease. Any of these occurrences could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and prospects. Further, following the COVID-19 pandemic, most insurance companies have begun to exclude pandemics from their insurance coverage of operating losses. To the extent we renew our insurance coverage or face a subsequent pandemic, our insurance coverage of the negative impact on our operating losses would no longer be subject to coverage.",,,,N/A

We do not own the Burger King brand, and we are therefore highly dependent on the franchisor, BK Europe and its ultimate parent, Burger King Corporation (“BKC”). Moreover, the Master Franchise Agreement contains certain undertakings, and failure to reach certain restaurant opening milestones may result in fines or early termination in certain circumstances. If the Master Franchise Agreement were terminated, we would not be able to continue to expand the Burger King network and realize anticipated economies of scale, although we would be able to continue to operate the existing Burger King network under certain conditions. The early termination of the Master Franchise Agreement with BK Europe could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We cannot control or influence the actions of BK Europe as master franchisor, and BK Europe may take actions that could harm our operation of Burger King brand restaurants. For example, BK Europe may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours. Certain actions taken by BK Europe, including those involving the Burger King brand, may adversely affect our business operations such as BKC requiring its franchisees to adopt a product offering that we do not believe would be popular with consumers in France. Moreover, if BK Europe does not adequately protect the Burger King brand and other intellectual property rights, Burger King’s brand perception could deteriorate in France and our competitive position, business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Additionally, pursuant to the Master Franchise Agreement with BK Europe, Burger King is required to comply with operational programs established by the master franchisor. For example, the Master Franchise Agreement requires that our Burger King restaurants comply with specified design criteria. In addition, the master franchisor generally has the right to require us to remodel Burger King restaurants to conform to the then-current image of Burger King, which may require the expenditure of considerable funds. Failure to conform to these requirements could constitute a breach of the Master Franchise Agreement, which could adversely affect our competitive position, business, results of operations and financial condition.

44_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to our Business,1.1.5,Consumer preferences and perceptions in relation to food consumption may continue to change and we may be unable to adapt to such changes,"Our business is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions in relation to both drink and food, as well as demographic trends over time. If we fail to tailor the restaurant brands in our portfolio to respond to customers’ evolving preferences, we may not be able to sustain or increase customer traffic and we may lose our market share to our competitors. While the restaurant brands in our portfolio cater to different consumer preferences through diverse cuisine types, price points, formats and channels, our overall success depends on the continued appeal of such brands in the context of rapidly evolving consumer preferences. In particular, the QSR segment is characterized by the frequent introduction of new products, often supported by substantial promotional campaigns, and is subject to changing consumer preferences, tastes, and eating and purchasing habits. Any failure by us to anticipate, identify and respond to trends in consumer preferences could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. Customers have become increasingly concerned with making health-conscious dining choices, as well as the provenance of locally sourced ingredients, which impacts all of the restaurant brands in our portfolio, but in particular has a strong impact on the product options available in our QSR restaurant brands. If we do not rapidly and adequately respond to prevailing health or dietary preferences and perceptions, consumers may avoid our restaurant brands, particularly our QSR brands, in favor of alternative food options, which could cause our business to suffer. In addition, negative publicity about the options that our restaurant brands offer could adversely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In recent years, numerous restaurant concepts have introduced products positioned to capitalize on the growing consumer preference for food products that are, or are perceived to be, healthy, nutritious and low in calories, sodium and fat content or that meet other nutritional criteria, such as gluten-free, vegetarian or vegan. Our success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences, tastes and eating and purchasing habits by adapting the restaurant brands in our portfolio to respond to these changes and our franchisees adequately adapting these changes. Responding to such shifts in consumer preferences could entail specific costs. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to respond to these or other trends in consumer preference by introducing changes to our formats, brands, drink and food offerings and premises or otherwise. In addition, consumers are increasingly reliant on food delivery services. This trend was significantly accelerated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sustained consumer reliance on food delivery services could have longterm effects on our operations. In France, the food delivery service industry is predominantly concentrated among a few key players, such as Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just-Eat. A sustained increase in our consumers’ preference for food delivery has made us reliant on the few main delivery aggregators. Further, purchases made through third-party delivery aggregators require the payment of an additional fee to such third-party aggregators, increasing our overall costs. In the long-term, we may need to raise our prices to recoup the additional delivery fees, or alternatively reduce our margins. Our business is significantly influenced by the evolving preferences and perceptions of consumers, not only regarding the products we offer but also the channels through which they access them. As trends shift, there is an increasing expectation for a variety of dining options, including home delivery, eat-in, click & collect, drive-through, and take-away services. Our restaurant brands must adeptly develop and balance these offerings to meet the diverse needs of our customers. The failure to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences for product offerings or service modalities could result in a decline in customer patronage. Any such eventuality could reduce our sales or have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. If our competitors are more innovative than we are, if we fail to appropriately respond to changes in consumer preferences and perceptions or if prevailing health or diet preferences cause customers to avoid our restaurants brands, in particular our QSR restaurant brands, in favor of foods that are perceived to be healthier, we may fail to retain existing, or attract new, customers. Any failure to retain existing, or attract new, customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 40 -----",,,,N/A

However, food-borne illnesses, such as E. coli, listeria, bovine spongiform encephalopathy or “mad cow disease”, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella, and food safety issues have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future. New illnesses resistant to existing precautions or diseases with long incubation periods may develop in the future, such as mad cow disease, which could give rise to claims or allegations on a retroactive basis. Risks to the health of our customers can arise from our supply and logistics chain, which we do not control, and at our Company Restaurant and Franchise Restaurant locations. We rely on third party food suppliers, distributors, logistics and warehousing partners to supply ingredients used in the preparation of the meals our restaurant brands sell, including sauces, meat and fresh produce. Although such third parties are subject to regulations, including food safety and environmental regulations, such regulations may not prevent such third parties from experiencing problems related to food safety and hygiene. Further, although we aim to work with the highest quality suppliers by pre-approving a limited number of suppliers that work with our restaurant brands, we do not control such suppliers and cannot guarantee that food safety related risks will not materialize. As a result, our reliance on third party food suppliers, distributors, logistics and warehousing partners increases the risk that food-borne illness incidents could be caused by factors outside of our control and that multiple restaurant brands and locations would be affected rather than a single restaurant. In addition, although we maintain operational controls and provide employee and franchisee training aimed at preventing food-borne illnesses, food tampering and other food safety issues, we can provide no assurance that these measures will be sufficient. Moreover, we are increasingly reliant on food delivery aggregators to deliver food from our restaurants to the customers, which may increase the risk that food- or beverage-borne illness incidents and food safety issues could be caused by factors outside of our control. Any report or publicity linking us, one of our franchisees, any of our brand restaurants in France or, in the case of our brands that also have international operations, restaurants in other countries, to instances of food-borne illness or other food safety issues, including food tampering or contamination, could adversely affect any of the brands in our portfolio, along with our revenue and profits. Outbreaks of disease, including influenza, or the continued emergence of COVID-19 variants, could reduce footfall in our restaurants. If customers were to become ill from food-borne or hygiene-related illnesses, we or our franchisees could also be forced to temporarily close some restaurants and, more significantly, our reputation and the reputation of our brands could be damaged, which could result in a decline in sales, thereby negatively affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, failure by any of our third-party food suppliers, distributors, logistics and warehousing partners to comply with regulations, allegations of compliance failure, claims of intentional or negligent contamination of ingredients and raw materials or prolonged and intense negative publicity may disrupt their operations and result in a disruption of our food supply. Disruption of our third-party food suppliers, distributors, logistics and warehousing partners’ operations could in turn reduce or impair our supply of ingredients or other raw materials, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. This risk is heightened in the case of our restaurant brands that rely on the supply pooling that we facilitate, as a reduction in supply from any one of our supply pool suppliers that provides products for multiple restaurant brands could have an impact across multiple restaurant brand operations. In addition, instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring at restaurants of competitors could also adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition as a result of negative publicity about the food service industry generally. The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of ingredients, which could result in supply chain disruptions, significantly increasing our costs and/or lowering margins for us and our franchisees. In addition, our industry has long been subject to the threat of food tampering by suppliers, employees or guests, such as the addition of foreign objects in the food that we sell. We cannot guarantee that our operational controls and employee training will be effective in preventing food-borne illnesses, food tampering and other food safety issues that may affect our restaurants. Reports of alleged injuries caused by food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations of restaurant chains and could negatively affect us in the future as well. 41 ----- In addition, the QSR industry is currently under heightened journalistic, legislative and regulatory scrutiny stemming from the perception that some QSR products have contributed to widespread medical problems, such as obesity and diabetes. See “—The growing concern about obesity and personal health may affect our sales.” Compliance with consumer health laws and regulations, such as those regarding the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items, may be costly and time-consuming. Additionally, if such laws and regulations change significantly, our QSR restaurant brands may be required to modify or discontinue certain menu items, and the higher costs associated with the implementation of those changes may reduce our margins. We cannot make any assurances regarding our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health regulations or our ability to successfully implement the nutrient content disclosure requirements and to adapt our menu accordingly. The imposition of menu-labeling laws could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions, as well as on the QSR industry in general.",,,,N/A

Brand value is partly based on consumer perceptions of a variety of subjective qualities, some of which we may have limited or no control over. Isolated or repeated events that originate from us, our franchisees or suppliers, can significantly reduce brand value and consumer trust, particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation. For example, our restaurant brands could be damaged by claims or perceptions about the quality or safety of our products or the quality of our suppliers and distributors, regardless of whether such claims or perceptions are true. The reputation of our restaurant brands can also be negatively impacted if consumers perceive that we or our franchisees have acted in an unethical, illegal, biased or socially irresponsible manner. Further, entities in our supply chain may engage in conduct, including alleged human rights abuses, which damages the reputation of the brands in our portfolio. Any such incidents could cause a decline in consumer confidence in, or negatively affect the perception of, our restaurant brands, decreasing the value of our brands as well as consumer demand for our restaurants, which could result in lower revenue and profits. We may not always be able to control the occurrence and mitigation of such incidents that create a negative impact on our brands’ reputation. Additionally, our corporate reputation could suffer from a real or perceived failure of corporate governance or misconduct by a company officer or representative.

With respect to the Burger King brand, we pre-approve a limited number of suppliers, while logistics are managed by QSR Logistics. For the rest of our brands, we pre-approve a limited number of key product suppliers for each brand and have also put into place supply pooling systems for products used by multiple brands (such as beverage and packaging), with logistics of key products managed through third parties, mainly Transgourmet and Sysco. As a result, we are dependent on the third parties that provide supply, logistics and distribution services to our brands to ensure smooth restaurant operations across our entire business. This select group of third parties, while ensuring consistency and quality, also present a vulnerability. Any issues that arise with these third parties, such as a disruption due to economic, environmental, or political factors, could hamper 42 ----- our restaurant brands’ ability to provide their respective signature dining experiences, which could result in fewer sales and have a negative impact on our financial performance. This risk is heightened in connection with the supplies secured through our supply-pooling platform. While the decision to pool the procurement of certain supplies across brands streamlines the supply of key materials and provides cost saving advantages, it also creates a risk that any issue, shortage or delay of materials secured through the supply pooling platform will have a negative impact on multiple brands across our portfolio. While we may in the future choose to certify additional suppliers in order to diversify our raw material sourcing or to replace our existing suppliers, such certifications may take longer than anticipated to obtain. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to locate suppliers that meet our certification requirements quickly. Any difficulty in locating an adequate number of such certified suppliers could affect our restaurants’ operations and market position, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. While we negotiate contract renewals where desirable, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining renewals of our existing contracts with our suppliers on the same or similar terms, or at all. Failure to timely agree renewals with our suppliers and distributors, termination of these agreements or a variation of its terms could cause distribution or supply disruptions and could increase costs if we are required to find alternative suppliers and distributors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. Further, the lack of direct control over these third-party suppliers and logistics providers adds another layer of complexity to our risk management. We require the suppliers that service our restaurant brands to meet certain specifications and standards to ensure the high quality of our products.

In the event of a supply disruption, a rise in commodities prices or other adverse event that affects our sources, our food, fuel and electricity or logistics costs could materially increase. Increases in prices or scarcity of ingredients or packaging materials required for the food served by our restaurant brands could increase our costs and disrupt our operations. Volatility in global food and drink prices and energy costs can have a negative impact on our operating margins. Although we have procedures in place to anticipate changes in the cost of certain raw materials used in the preparation of our products, any increase in the cost of the ingredients used in our products that cannot be transferred to our customers could affect our results of operations. If supplies of these materials become scarce or prices otherwise increase significantly and remain high for an extended period of time, there can be no assurance that we would be able to pass on any or all of the effects of such price increases to our customers, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Further, we face the risk that these third-party delivery aggregators do not comply with existing regulations governing fair labor practices, which increases the risk of negative publicity for us, our franchisees and our restaurant brands. In addition, third-party delivery services typically charge restaurants a per order fee, and as such utilizing third-party delivery services may not be as profitable as sales directly to our customers, and may also introduce food quality and customer satisfaction risks outside of our control. These digital ordering and payment platforms also could be damaged or interrupted by power loss, technological failures, user errors, cyber-attacks, other forms of sabotage, inclement weather or natural disasters and have experienced interruptions and could experience further interruptions, which could limit or delay customers’ ability to order through such platforms or make customers less inclined to return to such platforms.

Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, other influential investors, lenders and other market participants are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed 44 ----- increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments and consumer choices. Regardless of the industry, investors’ increased focus related to ESG and similar matters may hinder access to capital, as investors may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a result of their assessment of a company’s ESG practices. Companies which do not adapt to or comply with investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which are evolving, or which are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, may suffer from reputational damage and the business, financial condition, and/or stock price of such a company could be materially and adversely affected. Notably, the ESG regulations to which we are subject are rapidly evolving. See “—We are subject to _health, safety and environmental regulations, which could result in increased costs and fines, as well as the potential for damage to our reputation.”_ We have adopted certain practices and policies to align our ESG approach with our strategy in order to deliver long-term social, environmental and economic values across our business. See “Business—ESG & Sustainability.” While we have in place robust ESG processes for most of our brands, our ESG procedures are still in the process of development and implementation for certain of our more recently acquired brands. We have developed internal processes to track, aggregate and disclose our ESG procedures and standards, however such processes require significant management time and attention. Even though many of the ESG procedures we have in place are robust, comply with market expectations and in certain cases go beyond legal requirements, if we do not adequately disclose our ESG procedures, we may be perceived to not have responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues. Further, our stakeholders may look to us to implement more or different ESG procedures, standards or goals in order to continue engaging with us, to remain invested in us, or before they make further investments in us. We may also face increasing pressures from investors, lenders and other market participants, who are increasingly focused on climate change, to prioritize sustainable energy practices, reduce our carbon footprint and promote sustainability. We are also subject to evolving environmental regulations, the implementation of which may be costly and time-consuming. See “We are subject to health, safety and _environmental regulations, which could result in increased costs and fines, as well as the potential for damage to our reputation”. As a result, we may be required to implement more stringent ESG procedures or standards so_ that our existing and future investors and lenders remain invested in us and make further investments in us. Additionally, we may face reputational challenges in the event our ESG procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by certain constituencies or such constituencies might not be satisfied with our efforts or the speed of adoption of ESG practices or polices. If we do not meet our stakeholders’ expectations or we are not effective in addressing social and environmental responsibility matters or achieving relevant sustainability goals, trust in our brand may suffer and our business and/or our ability to access capital could be harmed. These limitations in both the debt and equity capital markets may affect our ability to grow as our plans for growth may include accessing such capital markets. If those markets are unavailable, or if we are unable to access alternative means of financing on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to implement our business strategy, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and may also impair our ability to service our indebtedness.

As demographic and economic patterns change, current locations may not continue to be attractive or profitable. Possible declines in neighborhoods where such restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those neighborhoods could result in reduced revenue in those locations, which could have an impact on franchisee royalties and our margins. In addition, opening new restaurants that adapt to the customer preferences of our restaurant brands may present additional costs and challenges. For example, drive-through restaurants for 45 ----- restaurant brands operating in the QSR space, such as our Burger King brand, may require sites with specific characteristics and there are a limited number of suitable sites available in our geographic market. Desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing restaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation and we may face competition from other restaurant chains for the same or nearby locations. We may also relocate or open restaurants in new areas in anticipation of future development which ultimately does not materialize. In addition, if a franchisor under a Pure Franchise agreement terminates its relationship with us, ceasing restaurant operations in a desirable location, we may be required to find another replacement location, which may happen quickly or at all. Further, an increasing number of local authorities mandate certain environmental requirements in connection with the opening of new restaurants in their communities, including monitoring carbon impact and an assessment of impact on biodiversity. As a result, building permits for new restaurant sites may be more difficult to obtain or may require us to comply with new local requirements, which may be costly. The confluence of several factors as, the limited availability of suitable land, regulatory hurdles, local authority reluctance, and intense competition for prime locations, can significantly impact our ability to maintain and expand our restaurant footprint. The occurrence of one or more of these events could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.",,,,N/A

We believe that under the guidance of Mr. Olivier Bertrand, the Group has significantly transformed the franchise restaurant industry in France by developing existing brands and tremendously increasing their presence throughout the entire French territory. Historically, Mr. Olivier Bertrand has played a key role in our development and communication, positioning us as one of the leaders in the franchise food restaurant sector. Mr. Olivier Bertrand has been instrumental in ensuring that the brands in our portfolio are perceived as leaders in France. Considering the pivotal role Mr. Olivier Bertrand plays in the Group and his status as a well-known public figure, his departure from the Group for any reason, or any damage to his personal reputation, could materially adversely affect our reputation, brand awareness, business, operational results, financial condition and prospects.",,,,N/A

We aim to accelerate the development of our franchise network, particularly across our casual dining brand portfolio, featuring the Au Bureau, Hippopotamus, Léon, Pitaya and Volfoni brands, as a result of which we expect the overall proportion of our Franchise Restaurants in our network to increase. As a food service franchisor, our business relies on the revenue generated from our Franchise Restaurants, which consists of brand royalties, advertising contributions and, in the case of Franchise with Lease Management agreements, lease management fees, each calculated on the basis of a percentage of SWS. Consequently, our results of operations depends substantially upon our franchisees’ sales volumes, which in turn depends on recruiting and retaining qualified and motivated franchisees who play a crucial role in integrating our strategic initiatives and delivering the consistent quality and service that customers expect from our restaurant brands. The process of identifying individuals with the right blend of business acumen, commitment and financial resources is challenging and competitive. Once franchisees are part of our network, maintaining good relationships is paramount, particularly as our business strategy entails attracting high quality franchisees willing to open multibrand restaurants. These relationships are built on trust, support, and mutual benefit, and any breakdown can lead to operational issues, brand damage, and legal disputes. Franchisees who become dissatisfied may not only leave 46 ----- the network, affecting our expansion and revenue, but also potentially erode the brand’s reputation through negative word-of-mouth or public disputes. Franchisees may also choose to terminate their relationship with us in favor of operating competitors’ restaurant brands, which could result in our loss of local market share. As our franchisees benefit from our know-how and expertise, competition from former franchisees may undermine our competitive advantage. The support of our franchisees is important for the success of our promotional activities and the strategic initiatives that we seek to undertake, and the successful execution of these initiatives will depend on our ability to maintain alignment with our franchisees. While we can generally mandate certain strategic initiatives through enforcement of our franchise agreements, we need the active support, as well as the managerial competence and, in certain cases, the financial ability, of our franchisees if the implementation of these initiatives is to be successful. If a significant number of our franchisees are unwilling or unable to participate in the implementation of strategies that we believe are necessary to promote further growth, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.",,,,N/A

Our franchisees are independent operators and, while we can mandate certain operational standards and procedures through the enforcement of our franchise agreements, we may not be able to quickly respond to franchisees that do not uphold these standards. Further, we cannot control many of the factors that impact the traffic in their restaurants, which directly affect sales generated in their restaurants, which in turn impacts our revenues, which are generated as a percentage of their restaurant sales. Although we provide support and know-how to our franchisees, including brand management, supply chain and procurement support and synergistic promotion of omni-channel capabilities, as well as operational quality control audits for our franchisees operating Burger King brand restaurants, we cannot guarantee the performance of franchisee restaurants in line with the standards we set and that our model will be successfully implemented in their individual restaurants. We depend on our franchisees to provide high-quality and consistent service in order to maintain the value of our restaurant brands, however we are at the risk that they fail to abide by the standards we set. Franchisees may be less directly interested in preserving or enhancing our brands and reputation than we are and may operate their restaurants in a manner inconsistent with our standards and requirements, such as the cleanliness, service or quality standards set forth in our franchise agreements and manuals, or standards set by governmental laws and regulations. Further, while we provide our franchisees with specific pricing recommendations for menu items, they are not obliged to follow these recommendations and may implement their own prices, which can have an impact on the price perception of our brands. In addition, franchisees may fail to adequately hire and train qualified managers and other restaurant personnel, which could have an impact on the quality of their offerings and customer experience. We also cannot prevent our franchisees from incurring indebtedness or conducting other businesses that could adversely affect their financial viability, nor can we control many other factors that impact the profitability of our franchise restaurants.

For a detailed 47 ----- description of each of these agreements, see “Business—Our Operating Models—Franchise Restaurants.” As of the year ended December 31, 2023, 53% of our franchise arrangements were Pure Franchise, while the remaining 47% were Franchise with Lease Management arrangements. These agreements have a typical duration of nine years (renewable under certain conditions) for Franchise with Lease Management and ten years (renewable under certain conditions) for Pure Franchise. Our franchisees who have entered into such agreements to operate one or several restaurants may be unwilling or unable to renew their franchise agreements with us for a number of reasons, including low sales volumes, high rental costs, lack of profitability, dissatisfaction with our services or a desire to retire. If our franchisees under our Franchise with Lease Management arrangements cannot, or decide not to, renew their franchise agreements with us, we will have to find a replacement franchisee to operate their restaurants or otherwise operate them as company restaurants. If a substantial number of franchises are not renewed, we may lose a significant amount of revenue, as a result of which our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. With respect to our Pure Franchise arrangements, our franchisees either own or directly lease the building in which they operate their restaurants. To the extent that franchisees under our Pure Franchise model decide to terminate their relationship with us, we will lose our ability to operate in that restaurant location, which can cause a significant impact in the case of restaurants that are located in key desirable strategic locations.",,,,N/A

We rely on our franchisees to integrate our advertising and marketing initiatives, as well as to fund the budgets of such initiatives based on a percentage of their sales. A key element of our business strategy involves the development of innovative brand marketing and advertising, tailored to each of the restaurant brands in our portfolio. As part of this process, we identify the key target market for each brand and develop unique marketing campaigns across different channels and platforms to strengthen customer engagement. If our marketing and advertising programs are not successful, if our competitors increase spending on advertising and promotion or if our marketing and advertising programs happen to coincide with a larger marketing and advertising program from one or more of our competitors thereby, rendering our advertising program less visible or effective, we may not be able to attract new customers and retain existing customers for our restaurant brands, as a result of which our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Further, the marketing and advertising programs that we develop for the Burger King brand must be approved by BKC, the owner of the Burger King brand. If BKC does not approve our market and advertising programs, we may have to develop replacement programs, which could involve additional significant costs and delay the implementation of our marketing and advertising programs. Our franchisees under both our franchise models contribute to the relevant advertising fund associated with the brand under which they operate based on a percentage of their gross sales (with such percentage varying per restaurant brand). As a result, our advertising fund expenditures per brand depend on sales volumes at the restaurants across our portfolio operating under such brands. If such sales decline, there will be a reduced amount available for our marketing and advertising programs. Given the importance we place on advertising and marketing as a direct contributor to our success, we may have to maintain a certain level of marketing and advertising expenditure (notwithstanding any decline in sales) in order to compete and maintain our exposure in the market. In such circumstances, our margins may be diminished, which will have a negative effect on our results of operations. In addition, our margins may also be affected if the cost of mounting advertising campaigns increases.

From time to time, franchisees may fail, intentionally or unintentionally, to accurately report their sales performance, which may result in reporting sales levels that are lower than actual sale levels generated. As a result, such franchisees may generate less revenues for us than they would have had to provide to us had they reported their actual accurate sales levels. In addition, if a material number of franchisees do not correctly report their sales, or if such reports are delayed, our overall sales numbers will not be accurate, in which could have an impact on strategic planning decisions and our ability to analyze, plan and forecast our performance may be affected.

For more information about regulations applicable to our franchise contracts, notably the Loi Doubin and provisions of the French Commercial Code, see “Regulation.” Any claim that we have violated regulations applicable to our relationships with franchisees, including claims that we failed to provide sufficient information or support to a franchisee or claims that we impeded the ability of a franchisee to conduct its business freely, may, among other things result in the imposition of fines on us, harm our relationships with our franchisees, require us to compensate the affected franchisees or potentially trigger claims for contract annulment on the grounds of lack of consent, negatively impact the likelihood of potential franchisees joining our networks, and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Additionally, under French franchise law, franchisees are independent entrepreneurs who have freely entered into franchise contracts with a franchisor to use our brand names and know-how in exchange for payment of certain fees and royalties. Although we are not responsible for the employees hired by our franchisees, any change in the relevant laws or re-characterization of the employment relationships between our franchisees and/or their employees by a court or tribunal could oblige us to either hire such employees directly or make arrangements causing us to incur liabilities related to contributions to certain social security programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

Our growth strategy is based on the sustained performance and expansion of our restaurant brand network, both through growth of the existing restaurants of the brands in our portfolio, as well as the introduction and integration of additional new restaurant brands within our network. As part of this growth strategy, we will continue to seek franchisees to operate new restaurants in France, both under existing and newly acquired or developed restaurant brands, and potentially abroad. We believe that our ability to recruit, train, retain and contract with qualified franchisees will be increasingly important to our operations as we expand. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to attract new franchisees, which will affect our ability to implement our growth strategy. In addition, while we apply stringent criteria when selecting new franchisees, such as previous experience in the business and access to financial resources, there is no assurance that the franchisee will be successful. 49 ----- Developing and opening restaurants involve substantial risks, including the following: - the availability of suitable locations and competition for such locations for potential development sites, the negotiation of acceptable lease terms, and delays in obtaining construction permits, clearing potential pre-construction regulatory requirements and in completion of construction; - the impact of local tax, zoning, land use and environmental rules and regulations on our ability and the ability of our franchisees to develop restaurants, and the impact of any material difficulties or failures that we and our franchisees experience in obtaining the necessary licenses and approvals for new restaurants; - changes in governmental rules, regulations and interpretations; - the availability of financing, at acceptable rates and terms, to both franchisees and third-party landlords, for restaurant development; - employing and training qualified personnel; - securing acceptable suppliers; - developed properties not achieving desired revenue or cash flow levels once opened; and - general economic and business conditions. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully open new restaurants or that such restaurants will generate strong sales or profits. Delays in the scheduled opening of new restaurants, due to construction hold-ups or other unforeseen issues, pose a significant risk to our expansion plans and financial forecasts. These interruptions can lead to increased costs, missed opportunities, and a delay in revenue generation, impacting our overall business momentum. Further, new restaurants may be located in areas where we have little or no meaningful operating experience and, in such instances, we typically have to rely on the expertise and local knowledge of our local partners. Such markets may have different competitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets, which may cause our new restaurants to be less successful than restaurants in our existing markets or to incur losses. Our growth strategy also contemplates network growth through the acquisition or development of new restaurant brands, including internationally. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to adequately select the optimal location for such new restaurants based on target market, consumer preference and regional discretionary spending patterns as we begin to integrate new restaurants and brand concepts into our network, the performance of which will need to be monitored. Failure to properly deploy and utilize capital and other resources in furtherance of our identified strategy may negatively affect our planned activities. Given the various risks to which we are exposed and the uncertainties inherent in our business, we cannot guarantee the successful execution of our business and growth strategy. Additionally, the implementation of our strategy may put operational strain on our business and consume management time and focus to the detriment of our existing business operations.

We have in the past acquired companies or businesses, such as our acquisition of the Pitaya restaurant network in 2022, the Léon restaurant network in 2019, the Hippopotamus restaurant network in 2017 and the QSR restaurant Quick’s network in 2015 (which we converted into Burger King restaurants), and may in the future strategically evaluate and pursue other acquisitions. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including difficulties in integrating operations, existing contracts and personnel of an acquired restaurant network; difficulties in supporting and transitioning supply chains to our existing pre-approved supplier network; diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition or growth opportunities; failure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction; failure to identify all the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings of an acquired restaurant brand, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices; risks of entering new markets in which we have limited or no experience; potential loss of key employees or vendors; or inability to generate sufficient revenues to offset acquisition costs, among others. In our evaluation of our recent and potential acquisitions, assumptions are made as to our ability to increase sales as well as improve restaurant-level profitability particularly in the areas of food, labor and cash controls as well as other operating expenses. If we are not able to make such improvements in these operational areas as planned, the acquired restaurants’ targeted profitability levels will be affected which could cause an adverse effect on our overall financial results and financial condition. Further, our growth plans include the organic creation and development of new brand concepts. This process involves significant development expenditures, which may not yield the results we anticipate achieving within a certain time, or at all. Any misjudgments in developing such brands (such as misjudging consumer preferences, target market, brand positioning or preferred consumption channels) or flaws in our execution could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot guarantee that the integration of new restaurant brands in our portfolio will generate the expected synergies and cost-saving benefits that contribute to our overall business strategy. There is a risk that these anticipated advantages may not materialize as expected or at all. The complexities of integrating a new restaurant brand into our existing network can lead to underestimating the costs and resources required. The process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business and the loss of key personnel. The diversion of management’s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the acquisition of restaurant brands and integration of acquired restaurants brand operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Further, the successful integration and growth of new restaurant concepts will depend on our ability to identify and enter into franchise agreements with high quality and motivated franchisees who are willing and able to execute our vision for such new concepts, which may evolve in early stages as the market performance of such restaurant brands is evaluated. If the integration process fails to deliver the projected synergies or if the costs of achieving these benefits are higher than anticipated, our financial performance and strategic positioning could be adversely affected. We may from time to time pursue disposals or cease operating certain brands, which involve numerous risks that could have an adverse impact on our business. Periodically, we may engage in the disposal of certain assets of our business or cease operating restaurant brand concepts that no longer help meet our objectives, which carries inherent risks. These disposals could lead to operational disruptions, loss of revenue and unanticipated costs or liabilities that may negatively affect our business continuity and financial health. The success of any disposal depends on market interest for the assets or business sold and our and our franchisees’ ability to maintain optimal management of operations during the transition phrase. Even following a successful disposal, we face the risk of potential claims by former franchisees or by purchasers of such assets or restaurant brands. Impairment charges are possible due to the nature and timing of decisions we make about underperforming assets or markets, or if previously opened or acquired restaurants perform below our expectations.

This execution of this strategy exposes us to numerous risks that could impede our success in new markets. Any future international operations could be negatively impacted by volatility and instability in international economic, political, security or health conditions in the countries in which we eventually operate, especially in emerging markets. Navigating different regulatory environments, cultural nuances and consumer preferences requires precise execution and adaptability. Missteps in understanding and adapting to these factors can lead to underperformance or failure of new international locations. Additionally, the complexities of establishing supply chains, recruiting local franchisee partners and talent to operate restaurants and managing operational logistics across borders add layers of challenge that could compromise our expansion efforts. If our international growth initiatives do not yield the anticipated results, this could adversely affect our overall business performance and strategic objectives. We may face limited availability for restaurant locations, higher location costs and difficulties in franchisee selection and financing.

These factors can influence footfall in our restaurant locations, which are typically higher during school holidays. Consumer consumption behavior and spending patterns are also influenced by weather conditions. Persistent rain, snow or other inclement weather, particularly during the summer months, over our peak trading periods or over weekends, adversely affects us. Certain of our restaurants, namely those with terraces or significant outdoor space, are particularly vulnerable to rain and other bad weather, as the inability to use their outdoor space prevents such restaurants from maximizing their trading capacity. Unfavorable weather conditions can also deter customers from physically dining out, opting instead for delivery service, which could come at a higher cost to us as we pay an additional fee to third-party delivery service aggregators, such as Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just-Eat. Seasonal fluctuations also impact our inventory, working capital and liquidity levels. We must carry a significant amount of inventory before the peak selling periods, which is also reflected in our liquidity with a certain time lag due to the payment terms that we have agreed with our suppliers. If net sales during our peak trading periods are significantly lower than we expect, we may be unable to adjust our working capital in a timely fashion.

44_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.4,Additional General Business Risks,1.4.2,"We are subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amount of space, including future increases in occupancy costs.","We currently lease the premises for all our Company Restaurants and Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants. Leases are generally for a fixed term between nine and twelve years and feature periodic increases based on indexation clauses. In addition, market practice for leasing commercial space in certain high value areas such as central Paris requires the payment of key money to lessors and/or the former tenant. Our ability to effectively renew our existing restaurant leases or obtain restaurant leases to open new restaurants depends on the availability of locations that meet our criteria for traffic, square footage, lease economics, demographics and other factors. We may not be able to renew our existing restaurant leases on favorable terms or 52 ----- at all, including, for example, when the landlord is able to establish statutory grounds for non-renewal or if the leases do not have the benefit of statutory or contractual rights of renewal. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were forced to renegotiate certain of our leases with our landlords. This renegotiation may have an impact on our future leasing transactions moving forward as landlords who operate in the retail space may impose higher rents or new and stringent conditions that would prevent losses like those sustained as a result of pandemicrelated lease renegotiations. We typically occupy our restaurants under operating leases with terms of nine to twelve years. Any favorable rental rates that we are able to negotiate upon entering such leases in the years when there are high vacancy rates are not guaranteed to continue, and this may force us to pay higher rents once those leases expire or restaurants are closed in desirable locations. In addition, under French law, the maximum increases in rent imposed by law do not apply to leases with a term in excess of nine years. Our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including: - requiring that a substantial portion of our available cash be applied to pay our rental obligations, thus reducing cash available for other purposes; - increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry in which we compete; and - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing. We intend to prioritize Franchise with Lease Management structures with our franchisees moving forward for our Burger King brand, pursuant to which we will continue to own the leasehold rights of the restaurants that they operate, relying on lease management fees as a proportion of gross sales to pay our landlords for such leasehold rights. The proportion of gross sales that we collect from our franchisees varies depending on the restaurant brand. We cannot guarantee that our franchisees will not encounter financial difficulties that could prevent them from paying such lease management fees. Further, if an existing or future Franchise with Lease Management restaurant records reduced profitability, we would collect a reduced amount of fees as lease management fees are structured as a fixed proportion of their sales. Any failure by our franchisees to pay lease management fees or to pay a reduced amount of such fees as a result of reduced sales could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Further, if any of our Company Restaurants or Franchise with Lease Management Restaurants are not profitable and we decide to close them prior to expiration of the relevant lease, we would still be liable for the fulfillment of the obligations under the lease. In the event we decide to close any underperforming restaurant, we would have to renegotiate the terms of the lease agreement with the landlord for the remainder of the term of the lease and/or potentially assign or sub-lease the premises to a third-party.

As of December 31, 2023, we directly employed 5,973 full-time equivalent employees (excluding franchisees’ employees). Our human capital includes approximately 691 corporate employees that provide services to our franchisees, as well as approximately 5,282 employees for the management and operation of our Company Restaurants. Our franchisees are independent business owners that separately employ the management and personnel in the restaurants they operate, however they face similar risks related to labor and the need to maintain strong relationships with their employees. Consequently, our success depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships with our employees. The occurrence of strikes, work stoppages or other labor disputes could materially disrupt our operations or result in a 53 ----- loss of reputation or increased wages and benefits, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In France, many of our employees are covered by national collective bargaining framework in place for the hospitality sector that contain provisions that could affect our ability to make certain business changes that impact our employees. As is the case with most companies of our size, we have ongoing disputes with certain of our former employees and may face related litigation in the future, which could affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We also seek to manage our labor costs and its impact on our margins. In this respect, we have to continuously monitor the productivity levels of our employees by measuring a variety of productivity indicators. In addition, we seek to minimize the long-term trend toward higher wages through increases in labor efficiencies; however, we may not be successful. Any increase in the minimum wage or labor regulations or protracted renegotiations of the restaurant industry collective contract in France could also increase our labor costs. As the minimum wage increases, we may need to increase not only the wage rates of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to the employees at wage rates which are above the minimum wage, which will increase our costs. The extent to which we are not able to raise our prices to compensate for increases in wage rates, including increases in social benefits costs, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, even if minimum wage rates do not increase, we may still be required to raise wage rates in order to compete for an adequate supply of labor. Furthermore, the successful operation of our Company Restaurants requires us to continue to attract, motivate and retain regional operational and restaurant general managers with the qualifications to succeed in our industry and the motivation to apply our core service philosophy. If we are unable to continue to recruit and retain sufficiently qualified managers or to motivate our employees to sustain high service levels, the perception of our brands could suffer and our business and our growth could be adversely affected. Qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions are in short supply. Following the COVID-19 outbreak, we have experienced a number of additional difficulties in recruiting and retaining employees, in particular due to prospective employees’ perception of the restaurant industry as requiring long hours and difficult working conditions. The inability to recruit and retain qualified individuals may delay the planned openings of new Company Restaurants or result in high employee turnover in existing Company Restaurants, which could harm our business. While our franchisees are independent businesses, they face similar risks in locating and recruiting qualified employees, which could have an impact on the profitability of their restaurants, thus potentially reducing the revenues that we receive them.

We are particularly susceptible to such risks given the high degree of engagement with social media by certain of our key customer groups such as the student population. See “—Our inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social _media could adversely impact our business.”_ Further, we may be subject to employee, customer and other claims in the future based on, among other things, mismanagement, unfair or unequal treatment, discrimination, harassment, violations of privacy and consumer credit laws, wrongful termination, and wage, rest break and meal break issues, including those relating to overtime compensation. Certain of the restaurant brands in our portfolio have been subject to these types of claims in the past and if one or more of these claims were to be successful or if there is a significant increase in the number of these claims, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. Although we devote significant attention and resources in ensuring that our restaurants meet all applicable health and safety standards, including through implementing relevant training and passing on know-how to our franchisees, any injury or health issue experienced by a customer in our facilities may result in litigation and negative publicity, and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition to the above, we rely on our suppliers to source materials for use in our restaurants, including the production of products and uniforms that we customize for our restaurant brands. For example, our Burger King brand restaurants require employees to wear a uniform, which are produced through the use of third-party manufacturers and suppliers. While we make efforts to vet our suppliers to ensure that they have in place appropriate standards that are in line with our criteria and adhere to, among other things, labor standards workplace safety, anti-discrimination and anti-harassment, we cannot guarantee that they will comply with such standards and we have limited means to monitor such compliance, which can be costly. Any events of non-compliance by our third-party suppliers or manufacturers with such key values could result in negative publicity and harm to the image of our restaurant brands. We may also choose to terminate our ongoing relationships with such non-compliant suppliers, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.",,,,N/A

We own or use various intellectual property rights, including trademarks, logos, licenses and domain names. In addition, we are the master franchisee for certain brands in France (for example, in the case of Burger King and Itsu), which gives us the exclusive right to use and to grant the right to use the trademarks and trade names of such brands in France. Our success depends on our continued protection of our intellectual property rights and our ability to use existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness of the brands in our portfolio. In particular, some of the trademarks used in the operation of our restaurants are owned by third parties who have granted us 55 ----- the right to use such trademarks. Among other things, pursuant to these agreements we are required to invest certain specified amounts, comply with certain capitalization and store opening requirements, abide by the guidelines relating to the use of the relevant trademarks and trade names, comply with certain reporting obligations and keep the owners’ proprietary information confidential. While we believe we have complied with our obligations under such agreements and have good relationships with the owners, if we were to default on any of these agreements, or if any of these agreements were to expire and we were unable to renew them, we would lose the right to use the relevant trademark. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, in relation to the brands that we do not own, we do not have the ability to influence the decisions of the owners of our operating trademarks with respect to their use or disposition. Any transfer, disposition or encumbrance of any of our operating trademarks by their owners could affect our ability to continue to use the relevant trademark or to renew the relevant agreements. We cannot be certain that third parties will not infringe, misappropriate or terminate our rights. Further, we cannot guarantee that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged by third parties. If we are unable to protect and maintain our own intellectual property rights or our use of the intellectual property rights owned by others, the value of our restaurant brands could be diminished and our competitive position could weaken. In addition, if we are unable to renew our intellectual property rights when they expire, the value of our restaurant brands could also be diminished and our competitive position could weaken. In addition, we are subject to risks related to our franchisees’ operations under our existing restaurant brands. For example, we may be involved in claims raised by third parties against our franchisees. Further, while we encourage our franchisees to maintain the integrity of the restaurant brands that they operate under, such franchisees may take actions that could harm the value of our brands’ intellectual property rights or the reputation of our brands. As we expand our portfolio to include new restaurant brands, we may face intellectual property claims from third parties. In addition, we may be unable to adequately register and protect our intellectual property rights as and when we enter new markets. Notably, we are subject to risk that the laws of the countries we choose do expand in might not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of France. Should our intellectual property rights be challenged or infringed upon, or should we infringe upon intellectual property rights of others, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.",,,,N/A
44_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.4,Additional General Business Risks,1.4.8,Information technology system failures or interruptions or breaches of our network security may interrupt our operations or cause customer personal data to be lost.,"We rely heavily on our computer systems and network infrastructure across our operations. We run, directly or indirectly, an extensive array of information systems (including servers, networks, applications, websites and databases) that are essential to the operation of the restaurant brands in our portfolio and management of our activities including for our ordering systems, stocking activities, logistics, financial reporting and management of systems monitoring performance. Our operations therefore depend on the continued and uninterrupted functioning of our IT systems. The centralization of many aspects of our operations, such as purchasing, marketing, property, finance, human resources and IT, to a certain extent make such functions more vulnerable to a catastrophic failure at the site or sites at which the IT systems underlying such functions are physically located. The development, implementation and continuous and uninterrupted performance of our hardware, network, applications, websites and other systems, including those which may be provided by third parties, are important factors across the operations of all of our restaurant brands. The robustness and efficiency of such systems and network infrastructure are critical to our business because our revenue and franchisee royalty calculations are based entirely on the accurate and timely recording of system-wide sales. We also collect and process personal data that we use in our daily business, including information about our employees, franchisees and customers through the use of loyalty programs for certain of our restaurant brands. Furthermore, we rely on technology not only to efficiently operate our restaurants but also to drive the customer experience, sales growth and margin improvement. Execution of our growth strategy will be dependent on our initiatives to implement proprietary and third-party technology solutions and gather and leverage data to enhance restaurant operations and improve the customer experience. We may not be able recruit and retain qualified individuals for these efforts, and there is intense competition for qualified technology systems developers necessary to develop and implement new technologies for our growth initiatives, including increasing our digital 56 ----- relationships with customers. Our strategic technology initiatives may not be implemented in a timely manner or may not achieve the desired results. Even if we effectively implement and manage our technology initiatives, they may not result in sales growth or margin improvement. Additionally, implementing the evolving technology demands of the consumer may place a significant financial burden on us. Moreover, our failure to adequately invest in new technology or adapt to technological developments and industry trends, particularly with respect to digital commerce capabilities, could result in a loss of customers and related market share. If our digital commerce platforms do not meet customers’ expectations in terms of security, speed, attractiveness or ease of use, customers may be less inclined to return to such digital commerce platforms, which could negatively impact our business. We attempt to effectively safeguard our IT systems and related equipment against damage or compromise from interruptions, data breaches, cyber-attacks, sabotage, hacking and phishing attempts. However, despite our implementation of security measures, all of our technology systems are vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Disruptions to operations or interruptions in operations involving such systems may occur in the future as well as regulatory intervention or reputational damage, and we could further incur liability to customers or experience loss of data. We cannot assure protection against unauthorized attempts to access the IT systems that we use. Further, there is a risk that inadequate disaster recovery plans and information security processes are in place to mitigate against a system outage, or failure to ensure appropriate back-up facilities (covering key business systems and the recovery of critical data) and loss of sensitive data, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Any leakage of our data by third party data breaches, particularly personal data that we collect and process, may violate the laws and regulations to which we are subject, which could have an adverse impact on our operations. See “—Failure to protect the integrity and security of personal _information of our franchisees, customers and employees could result in substantial costs, expose us to litigation and damage our reputation.” If our technology systems were to fail, and we were unable to recover in a timely_ way, we could experience an interruption in our operations which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.",,,,N/A

We also rely on third party service providers to process data collection and customer payments made using bank cards and credit cards. The use and handling of this information is regulated by evolving and increasingly demanding laws and regulations at the sub-national, national and international levels, as well as by certain third-party contracts. If we or any such third party service providers fail to transmit customer information in a secure manner, if any such loss of personal customer data were otherwise to occur or if our security and information systems are compromised as a result of data corruption or loss, cyber-attack or a network security incident or if our employees, franchisees or vendors fail to comply with data protection laws and regulations (and as a result information about our customers and employees is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately), we could be subject to liabilities and penalties, reputational damage, litigation or government enforcement actions, the incurrence of substantial costs and a loss of customer confidence, thereby adversely affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the “GDPR”), governing the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data came. The GDPR obligates EU-based companies or companies that process personal data about EU subjects (either as “data controllers” or as “data processors”) to comply with a large number of obligations, which relate for example to (i) the processing of personal data including transparency, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, security, and confidentiality; (ii) the ability of the controller to demonstrate compliance with such principles (accountability); (iii) the obligation to identify a legal basis before the processing; and (iv) rights of data subjects, such as, among others, transparency, right of access, right to rectification, or right to erasure. 57 ----- In spite of our continued efforts to comply with the GDPR and similar regulations, we still face the risk that customer data that we collect may be stolen or misappropriated. In particular, the GDPR offers data subjects the option to allow privacy organizations to litigate on their behalf, including collecting potential damages, which may result in a substantial increase in claims being brought. Our customers may be discouraged from providing us with their data and our business could be negatively affected as a result. Under such circumstances, our regulation, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. As a data controller, we could face legal actions in the absence of compliance with GDPR. In addition, we could also face legal action in the absence of compliance of a third-party processing personal data on our behalf. Given that we and/or third parties, on our behalf, process certain sensitive information, we are subject to specific processing conditions and have taken steps to ensure compliance with these conditions. The GDPR obligates companies to implement a number of formal processes and policies to review and document the privacy implications of the development, acquisition, or use of all new products, technologies, or types of data. The GDPR provides for substantial fines for breaches of data protection requirements, which can be up to 4.0% of the annual worldwide revenue of the preceding financial year or €20.0 million, particularly in the event of a breach of the conditions applicable to consent and/or related to data subjects’ rights. A fine may be imposed instead of, or in addition to, measures that may be ordered by supervisory authorities (such as the request to cease any processing). The GDPR, the national implementing legislation, i.e., the French data protection rules and French law in general, also provide for a private right of action on data subjects for breaches of data protection requirements and additional private enforcement mechanisms. For instance, the French supervisory authority may issue a public warning, as part of a control revealing infringements of the applicable data protection regulation, and in parallel a public formal order to comply with the applicable regulation. Complying with all relevant data protection laws and regulation is relatively complex. We, or the entities or businesses acquired by us, may have entered in the past or may enter in the future into supplier contracts, employment agreements or other types of material contracts that may not be compliant with applicable data protection laws and regulations. The failure to comply with these laws could subject us to significant administrative fines and sanctions, as well as civil and criminal liability in some cases.",,,,N/A
44_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.4,Additional General Business Risks,1.4.10,"Our inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could adversely impact our business.","Events reported in the media, including social media, whether or not accurate, could create and/or amplify negative publicity for our restaurant brands, our overall business or for the industry or market segments in which we operate (irrespective of whether such events are directly related to our restaurant brands or our operations). Such media topics could include food-borne or hygiene-related illnesses, issues with food traceability, contamination, unsanitary restaurant environment, issues relating to quality of service or product quality, discriminatory behavior, injuries or good citizenship. Media reports relating to any of these topics, even when not involving us, could reduce demand for our restaurants and could result in a decrease in customer footfall in our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types. In particular, with respect to social media, consumers value readily available information concerning the industry and market segments in which we operate, and often act on such information without further investigation, authentication and without regard to the accuracy of such information. The availability of information on social media platforms and devices is virtually immediate as is its impact. Information concerning or affecting us may be posted on such platforms at any time, including accurate and adverse information that may harm our business. Negative claims or publicity involving us, our brands, our franchisees, our services or our products, or the production methods of any of our suppliers, could seriously damage our reputation and image of our brand restaurants, regardless of whether such claims or publicity are accurate. As part of our marketing and advertising strategy, we seek to develop the social media presence of the restaurant brands within our portfolio. Our social media presence amplifies consumer engagement with our brands, but comes with less control compared to more traditional marketing methods due to the possibility of negative consumer comments in real time that we cannot control. Further, the presence of such comments on the social media platforms of our restaurant brands could imply that our brands are associated with such content or views, which may not align with our values. The harm from the spread of such inaccurate information may be immediate, without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. Any failure to maintain favorable brand recognition across the restaurant brands in our portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 58 ----- In addition, activist groups, including animal rights activists and groups acting on behalf of franchisees, the workers employed by suppliers and others, have in the past, and may in the future, use tactics to generate adverse publicity by alleging, for example, inhumane treatment of animals by our suppliers, poor working conditions or unfair purchasing policies. These groups may be able to coordinate their actions with other groups, threaten strikes or boycotts or enlist the support of well-known persons or organizations in order to increase the pressure on us or our industry to achieve their stated aims. In the future, these actions or the threat of these actions may force us to change our business practices or pricing policies, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. A decrease in consumer patronage as a result of negative publicity from social media could result in a decline in our revenue at Company Restaurants and Franchise Restaurants, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we frequently use social media to communicate with consumers and the public in general. Failure to use social media effectively could lead to a decline in brand value and revenue. Other risks associated with the use of social media include improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about our brand, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud, hoaxes or malicious dissemination of false information.",,,,N/A

Families with children are one of the key target markets of the QSR brands in our portfolio and if we are unable to effectively advertise and promote our products as a result of these restrictions on our media advertising campaigns, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.",,,,N/A
44_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.4,Additional General Business Risks,1.4.12,"We are subject to health, safety and environmental regulations, which could result in increased costs and fines, as well as the potential for damage to our reputation.","As a preparer of food products for human consumption, we are subject to health, safety and environmental directives, laws and regulations, including regulations promulgated and enforced by local, national, European and international authorities. See “Regulation”. These directives, laws and regulations relate to the remediation of land and water supply and use, water discharges, air emissions, waste management, noise pollution, the use of refrigerators and workplace and product health and safety. We are also subject to stringent food preparation, health, quality and nutritional disclosure regulations and standards, as well as permits and licenses for operating as a preparer of food products. Health, safety and environmental legislation in France and elsewhere has tended to become broader and stricter, and enforcement has tended to increase over time. The installation and operation of some of our restaurants and distribution centers require, depending on the required regulations, a number of environmental permits, including environmental impact assessments and environmental risk assessments. These authorities or those in charge of awarding environmental permits and licenses could revoke any of our permits, for reasons of public interest or if they determine that we have incurred in repeated violations of applicable laws and regulations, which could in turn affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Additionally, we may be liable for a number of environmental compliance costs in relation to our restaurant brands, such as costs relating to recycling (for example, recycling of our used cooking oil) and waste disposal. In addition, we may be liable for the costs of removal, investigation or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances, including asbestos, on or in a property owned or leased by us. The costs of any required removal, investigation or remediation of such substances may be substantial thus, if we were found to be liable for the costs arising from any of these or other obligations or if our franchisees were unable to meet their rental payments as a result of such obligations (including fines for non-compliance), our revenue could be adversely affected. The presence of such substances or the failure to remediate such substances properly may also adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or to borrow using the property as security. Changes in law or regulation may impose further liabilities on us which may also form the basis of liability to third persons for personal injury or other damages. 59 ----- Any failure to comply with health, safety and environmental requirements may lead to fines and other sanctions and even restaurant closures, as well as damage our reputation and that of our restaurant brands. If health, safety and environmental laws and regulations in France or in the countries from where we source our ingredients significantly evolve or are strengthened in the future, the extent and timing of investments required to maintain compliance may differ from our internal planning and may limit the availability of funding for other investments. In addition, if the costs of compliance with health, safety and environmental directives, laws and regulations continue to increase and it is not possible for us to reflect these additional costs in the price of our products, our profitability could be adversely affected. In addition, compliance with current and future directives, laws and regulations regarding the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items may be costly and time-consuming and could affect consumer eating habits. If consumer health regulations change significantly, we may be required to modify or discontinue certain menu items, and we may experience higher costs associated with the implementation of those changes. Further, in the ever-evolving regulatory landscape of the food service industry, there is a risk that government initiatives could mandate the inclusion of detailed nutritional information on menus. Should such regulations come into effect, we would be compelled to undertake a comprehensive analysis of our menu offerings across our restaurant brands to accurately report on nutritional content. This requirement would likely incur additional compliance costs, including but not limited to, the expenses associated with laboratory testing, menu redesign, staff training, alignment and training with our franchisees and the continuous updating of information to reflect any changes in menu items. The financial burden of adhering to these new regulations could be significant, potentially impacting our profit margins. Moreover, the implementation process could divert resources from other strategic areas of our business, such as marketing and customer experience enhancements. Therefore, we cannot make any assurances regarding our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health regulations or our ability to successfully implement the nutrient content disclosure requirements and to adapt our menu offerings accordingly. See “Regulation—Food and Beverage Regulations—Food Labeling and Nutrition.” We are also increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including the disposal of waste. These regulations are expected to become more expansive and stringent over time, which makes it challenging to predict the impact on our future operations. Additional changes in these laws and regulations could require us to devote capital or other resources to comply with such laws and regulations. As is the case for businesses of our size, we are subject to inquiries and investigations from regulatory bodies in the ordinary course of our business. Authorities may take the view that we are not compliant with applicable laws and regulations and, consequently, we may be required to make significant expenditures to defend against allegations of wrongdoing or modify our business practices to comply with differing interpretations of existing laws and regulations or with future laws and regulations, which may increase our costs and materially limit our ability to operate our business.

For instance, the French law of December 9, 2016 relating to transparency, fighting corruption and modernizing economic life (more widely known as the “Sapin II Law”) and other similar anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, agents or other third parties will not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law, particularly as we expand our operations in emerging markets and elsewhere. In the future, we may decide to enter countries that have legal and regulatory systems that are different than the one in France and in which corruption may occur more frequently and to a greater extent than in France. Under some circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these laws, but despite our compliance policies and training efforts (including hiring for an internal role exclusively dedicated to compliance with the Sapin II Law), we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from acts committed by our employees or third parties. 60 ----- Violations of such laws can result in civil penalties, including fines, denial of import/export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, disbarment from government contracts, termination of existing contracts, revocations or restrictions of licenses, criminal fines or imprisonment.

We cannot guarantee that the coverage limits under our insurance programs will be adequate to cover future claims or operating losses incurred. Further, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to natural disasters or acts of terrorism. Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for losses could result in materially different amounts of expense under these programs, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we could be liable to repair damage caused by uninsured risks, and could remain liable for any debt or other financial obligation related to those properties. As a result of the nature of our business, we are also exposed to the risk of other health and safety incidents, for example, accidents occurring on our premises. Any such occurrence could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. 61 ----- In connection with our insurance renewal process, our insurance costs may increase following the occurrence of several events resulting in substantial claims for damages, in response to any negative development in our claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance market in general.

Such laws and regulations are generally very complex. Additionally, because tax laws may not provide clear-cut or definitive doctrines, the tax regime applied to our operations and intragroup transactions or reorganizations is sometimes based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations. We cannot guarantee that such interpretations will not be questioned by the relevant tax authorities, which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Tax laws and regulations are subject to change, and new laws and regulations may make it difficult to restructure our operations in an advantageous manner. More generally, any failure to comply with the tax laws or regulations of the countries in which we operate may result in reassessments, interest on late payments, fines and penalties. Furthermore, we may record deferred tax assets on our balance sheet, reflecting future tax savings resulting from discrepancies between the tax and accounting valuation of the assets and liabilities or in respect of tax loss carry-forwards from our entities. The actual realization of these assets in future years depends on tax laws and regulations, the outcome of potential tax audits and the future results of the relevant entities. In particular, pursuant to Article 209, I, paragraph 3 of the French tax code (Code général des impôts) (the “French Tax Code”), the fraction of French tax loss carry-forwards that may be used to offset the taxable profit with respect to a given fiscal year is limited to €1.0 million plus 50% of the portion of taxable profit exceeding €1.0 million.

44_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.4,Additional General Business Risks,1.4.20,Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.,"We are subject to complex tax laws in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as international tax laws. Changes in tax laws or regulations or to their interpretations could adversely affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments. In particular, European and French tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and are subject to varying interpretations. For example, the current implementation into French tax law of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (the “OECD”) principles related to base erosions and profit shifting (“BEPS”) included in the final reports released by the OECD as well as the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS (the “MLI”) signed in Paris on June 7, 2017, and ratified by France on September 26, 2018, which became effective as of January 1, 2019 may increase the administrative efforts within our business and impact existing structures. For all countries which ratify the MLI after France, the relevant dates of application should be calculated on an individual basis. The MLI notably introduces a “principal purpose test” (“PPT”) denying tax treaty benefits to companies when obtaining such benefits was “one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in” these benefits, unless granting these benefits under the given circumstances would be “in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions” of the tax treaty. Whether a France entity relying on tax treaty benefits can be construed as being part of such type of arrangement will predominantly depend on source state views. Furthermore, the European Union continues to harmonize the tax legislation of the Member States. In this respect, the Council of the European Union (the “Council of the European Union”) adopted a directive “laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market” on July 12, 2016 (Council Directive 2016/1164) (the “ATAD”), as later amended on May 29, 2017, by the Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 (the “ATAD **II”). The ATAD provides, in particular, for a general interest limitation rule pursuant to which the tax deduction of net financial expenses is limited to 30% of the taxpayer’s tax adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) or to a maximum amount of €3 million, whichever is higher (subject to several exceptions). Such rules have been implemented into the French Code general des impôts (the “FTC”). See “French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a portion of _the interest on our indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to service our indebtedness” for more details on this rule._ In addition, the anti-abuse provision provided for by the ATAD with respect to French corporate income tax, which aims to address abusive tax practices that are not dealt with by specifically targeted provisions, was also implemented into French law. Pursuant to this provision, the French tax authorities may ignore an arrangement, or a series of arrangements, which, having been put into place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the applicable tax law, are not genuinely taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances. The European Commission also published a corporate reform package proposal on October 25, 2016, including three new proposals that aim at (i) relaunching the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (“CCCTB”) which 63 ----- is a single set of rules to compute companies’ taxable profits in the EU, (ii) avoiding loopholes associated with profit-shifting for tax between EU countries and non-EU countries, and (iii) providing new dispute resolution rules to relieve problems with double taxation for businesses. On May 18, 2021, the European Commission communicated a new framework for income taxation for businesses in Europe (“Business in Europe:",,,,N/A
44_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.5,Framework for Income Taxation” or “BEFIT”) which aims to replace the pending proposals under the CCCTB.,1.5.1,,"BEFIT is based mainly on the framework of the OECD’s international tax reform project and would involve the consolidation of the profits of the EU members of a multinational group into a single tax base, which would then be allocated to Member States using a formula and be taxed at national corporate income tax rates. The preparation for this new proposal is carried out by the European Commission alongside the Member States and the European Parliament and is giving rise to consultations with the business sector and civil society groups. On September 12, 2023, the European Commission adopted the BEFIT Directive proposal. Should this Directive be adopted, Member States shall adopt and publish the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by January 1, 2028. Alongside BEFIT, the European Commission also announced, among other things, that it would (i) table a legislative proposal setting out union rules to neutralize the misuse of shell entities for tax purposes (the “ATAD",,,,N/A

In this respect, French case law has developed the concept of “abnormal act of management” according to which the expenses incurred by a French company, in relation with transactions that are not aligned with its direct corporate interest, are not tax deductible. Under Article 39-1-3° of the FTC, interest paid by an entity to its direct shareholders who are not related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC are tax deductible only up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate referred to in Article 39-1-3° of the FTC (i.e., the annual average of the average effective floating rates on bank loans to companies with an initial maturity exceeding two years). (currently 5.39% for companies closing their fiscal year between November 30, 2023 and December 30, 2023) provided that the share capital of the borrowing company is fully paid-in. By exception, under Article 212 I-(a) of the FTC, interest incurred on loans granted by related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC is deductible up to the 65 ----- amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate referred to in Article 39-1-3° of the FTC or, if higher, up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate that the borrowing entity could have obtained from independent financial credit institutions in similar circumstances. Pursuant to Article 39.12 of the FTC, two entities will be regarded as related if (i) one of the entities holds directly or indirectly the majority of the other entity’s share capital or actually exercises the power of decision in that entity or (ii) both entities are controlled by a same third-party enterprise under the conditions defined in (i) above. In both cases (i.e., non-deductibility under Articles 39-1-3° and 212 I-(a) of the FTC), non-deductible interest might be re-characterized as deemed dividends pursuant to Articles 109 _et seq. of the FTC, and may thus be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 _bis 2 of the FTC, at the rate of (i) generally 25% for payments benefiting to legal persons, or (ii) 75% for payments made in non-cooperative jurisdictions (Etat ou _territoire non coopératif) within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the FTC (a “Non-Cooperative State”) other_ than those mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of the same Article 238-0 A (subject in each case to the more favorable provisions of any applicable double tax treaty). Pursuant to Article 212 bis of the FTC, the deductibility of net financial expenses incurred by an entity in respect of a given fiscal year is limited to the higher of (i) €3 million and (ii) 30% of its tax adjusted EBITDA in the same fiscal year (corresponding to its taxable income before offset of carry forward tax losses and without taking into consideration net financial expenses and, to some extent, depreciation, provisions and capital gains/losses) generated by such entity (the “30% Limitation”). Such limitation applies to both related-party and third-party financings regardless of the purpose of these financings, subject to certain limited exceptions. The net financial expenses are defined as the excess, if any, of the financial expenses of the borrower over its financial income. Furthermore, for entities being part of a group that files eligible consolidated financial statements, a safeguard clause has been implemented in order to partially exempt companies that are able to demonstrate that the ratio of their equity over their total assets is equal to or higher than the same ratio computed at the level of the accounting consolidated group to which they belong. In this specific case, net financial expenses exceeding the 30% Limitation are deductible up to 75% of their amount (i.e., the “Financial Autonomy Safe Harbor”). French thin-capitalization rules apply in respect of loans granted by related parties. Where the amount of the related party debt of a company exceeds a ratio equal to 1.5 time the company’s equity, the deduction of net financial expenses borne by such entity is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 30% of its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €3 million, multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by non-related parties (directly or indirectly) within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC increased by 1.5 time the company’s equity (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said year. The balance of net financial expenses is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 10% of its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €1 million multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by related parties (directly or indirectly) within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC exceeding 1.5 time the company’s own funds (assessed either at the beginning or on the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said fiscal year. However, the interest deductibility limitation provided for by these thin-capitalization rules does not apply if the borrowing company demonstrates that the overall debt-to-equity ratio of the group, as determined under accounting consolidation rules, to which it belongs is higher than or equal to its own debt-to-equity ratio (i.e., the “Indebtedness Safe Harbor”). These thin-capitalization rules could apply at the level of the Issuer’s tax consolidated group (in respect of any loans contracted by the Issuer (or any company belonging to the same French tax consolidated group) from any related party not belonging to the tax consolidated group) (i.e., the “Thin Capitalized Perimeter”) and at the level of the Issuer’s French subsidiaries that do not belong to the Issuer’s French tax consolidated group with respect to any amount of the proceeds of the Notes used by the Issuer to grant intragroup loans to such subsidiaries as well as, more generally, in respect of any loans contracted by the Issuer’s French subsidiaries from any related party. 66 ----- The 30% Limitation is increased by 75% of the portion of the net financial expenses which are non-deductible after application of the €3 million or 30% adjusted tax EBITDA limitation in three circumstances: (i) autonomous companies (i.e., companies which are not members of a consolidated group, have no establishment outside France and no associated company (appreciated between entities holding a stake of at least 25%)); (ii) companies or tax consolidated groups belonging to a consolidated group which do not qualify as a Thin-Capitalized Perimeter and that benefit from the Financial Autonomy Safe Harbor; and (iii) companies or tax consolidated groups belonging to a consolidated group which qualify as a Thin-Capitalized Perimeter but benefit from both the Indebtedness Safe Harbor and the Financial Autonomy Safe Harbor. Financial expenses that are disallowed pursuant to the 30% Limitation can be carried forward indefinitely and deducted in the future under the same conditions. On the other hand, the portion of financial expenses which tax deduction is disallowed as a result of the application of the €1 million threshold or 10% limitation is only eligible for carry-forward for one-third of its amount. The unused interest deduction capacity of a current fiscal year may also be used over the five following fiscal years, but only against financial expenses incurred in respect of those fiscal years, it being noted that this measure is not available to thinly capitalized entities. Specific rules apply to companies that belong to tax consolidated groups, i.e., mainly (i) the 30% Limitation is computed on the basis of the consolidated adjusted EBITDA generated by the relevant tax consolidated group and (ii) the 1.5 debt-to-own funds ratio is analyzed at the level of the tax consolidated group (x) on a consolidated basis pursuant to French accounting rules applying for purposes of establishing consolidated financial statements and (y) in respect of loans granted by related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC which do not belong to such tax consolidated group. Pursuant to the Bulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques-Impôts BOI-ISBASE-35-40-10-20, § 20, dated May 13, 2020 and BOI-IS-BASE-35-40-20, § 240, dated May 13, 2020, the portion of interest that is not deductible by virtue of (i) Article 212 _bis, I of the FTC under the 30% Limitation and/or (ii) Article 212 _bis, VII of the FTC under the thin-capitalization rules is not to be recharacterized as a “deemed distribution” pursuant to Articles 109 et seq. of the FTC and, therefore, is not subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the FTC. In addition, the ATAD II, in relation to hybrid mismatches with third countries has been implemented and is applicable as from January 1, 2020 (except for certain of its provisions which are applicable since January 1, 2022) and codified under Articles 205 B et seq. of the FTC provide limitations on interest deductions in the event of (i) a deduction of a payment at the level of a paying entity without a corresponding inclusion of such payment in the taxable income of the receiving entity (referred to as a “deduction without inclusion”) or (ii) a deduction of the same payment, operational expenses or losses in the taxable income of both the paying and receiving entity (referred to as a “double deduction”). Unlike the previous domestic anti-hybrid rules, payments made to taxexempt or low-taxed beneficiaries are not within the scope of these rules that only target differences in qualification or attribution of the right to tax an element of income. Such limitations only apply to payments taking place between “associated enterprises,” except for the so-called “structured arrangements” (i.e., an arrangement pricing the relevant mismatch or an arrangement designed to produce the mismatch, subject to certain conditions). If the hybrid mismatch results in a deduction without inclusion, the deduction from taxable income will generally be denied to the French paying entity. Alternatively, the payment to a French receiving entity will be included in its taxable income if deduction is not denied in the jurisdiction of the paying entity. If the hybrid mismatch results in a double deduction, the deduction will either be denied at the level of the receiving entity or at the level of the paying entity. In respect of fiscal years opened as from January 1, 2022, these provisions also cover reverse hybrid entities, referring to situations where an entity is deemed to be tax transparent by the Member State in which it is incorporated or established and the jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which its “associated enterprises” (i.e., entities holding directly or indirectly in aggregate an interest in 50% or more of its voting rights, capital interests or rights to share profit) are established, qualify the entity as non-transparent. Where such a hybrid entity is incorporated or established in France, its income is, as the case may be, either subject to French corporate income tax at its own level or taxable pursuant to Article 8 of the FTC at the level of its partners or shareholders, to the extent that it is not taxed in another State. 67 ----- The above-mentioned tax rules may limit our ability to deduct interest accrued on our indebtedness incurred in France and may thus increase our tax burden, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and reduce the cash flow available to service our indebtedness.",,,,N/A

These new regulations could impact our tax position in the future. On January 17, 2023, the European Parliament approved almost by unanimity the directive proposal to neutralize the misuse of shell entities for improper tax purposes within the European Union (the “ATAD III Proposal”), which was released by the European Commission on December 22, 2021. In order to be definitively adopted, the text will need to be approved by the Council of the European Union and subsequently implemented by Member States. Even if the European Council had initially targeted an application of this directive as from January 1, 2024, the exact timing for the vote and the directive’s implementation by Member States remains unclear at this stage. On September 12, 2023, the European Commission published a proposal for a Council Directive on transfer pricing (which is part of the BEFIT package) aiming at incorporating the arm’s length principle into European Union law, harmonizing the key transfer pricing rules, clarifying the role and status of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and creating the possibility to establish, within the European Union common binding rules on specific transfer pricing subjects. Should this directive be adopted, Member States would have to apply these provisions as from January 1, 2026. On October 8, 2021, members of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS (the “Inclusive Framework”) agreed to the Statement on the Two-Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy reflecting the agreement reached by 136 out of the 140 Inclusive Framework members. The TwoPillar Solution is comprised of Pillar One and Pillar Two. Pillar One aims at ensuring a distribution of profits and taxing rights among countries with respect to the largest multinational enterprises (“MNEs”) through the re-allocation of taxing rights over 25% of the residual profit of the largest and most profitable MNEs to the jurisdictions where the customers and users of those MNEs are located (“Pillar One”). Pillar Two puts a floor on tax competition on corporate income tax through the introduction of a global minimum corporate tax at a rate of 15% that countries can use to protect their tax bases (the “GloBE Rules”) (“Pillar Two”). On 20 December 2021, the OECD published the pillar two model rules (the “Model Rules”) for the domestic implementation of the 15% global minimum tax rate agreed upon in October 2021. The new Model Rules aim to assist countries to bring the GloBE Rules into domestic legislation. They provide for a coordinated system of interlocking rules that (i) define the MNEs within the scope of the minimum tax; (ii) set out a mechanism for calculating an MNE’s effective tax rate on a jurisdictional basis, and for determining the amount of top-up tax payable under the rules; and (iii) determine the member of the MNE group which will be required to pay the topup tax. 64 ----- On December 14, 2022, Directive 2022/2523 setting forth rules to ensure a global minimum level of taxation for multinational groups was adopted. The directive aims at consistently implementing among all 27 member states the Model Rules that include an Income Inclusion rule (“IIR”) and an Under Taxed Payment Rule (“UTPR”). However, it also extends its scope to large-scale purely domestic groups, in order to ensure compliance with the European Union fundamental freedoms. In addition, the directive makes use of an option contemplated by the Inclusive Framework whereby the member state of a low-taxed income entity (referred as constituent entity) applying the IIR is required to ensure effective taxation at the minimum agreed level not only for foreign subsidiaries but also for all constituent entities residents in that member State. The Member States had to transpose the directive into their national laws by December 31, 2023 for the rules to be applicable for fiscal years starting on or after December 31, 2023 (with the exception of the UTPR, which is to be applicable for fiscal years starting on or after December 31, 2024). The French Finance Law for 2024 (Law 2023-1322 of December 29, 2023) transposed the directive implementing Pillar Two into French domestic law, introducing a minimum tax of 15% on the profits of MNEs that operate in France and have a consolidated revenue of at least €750m generated during at least two of the last four fiscal years. On October 11, 2023, the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework published the text of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Amount A of Pillar One (the “MLC”). Amount A of Pillar One co-ordinates a reallocation of taxing rights to market jurisdictions with respect to a share of the profits of the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises operating in their markets, regardless of their physical presence. It also ensures the repeal and prevents the proliferation of digital services taxes and relevant similar measures, secures mechanisms to avoid double taxation, and enhances stability and certainty in the international tax system. Furthermore, specific rules on tax dispute resolution already apply since January 1, 2019, following the transposition of Council Directive 2017/1852 of October 10, 2017 into French tax law. These regulations could impact our tax position in the future. Our tax returns are prepared in accordance with applicable tax legislation and prevailing case law. Certain tax positions we take are based on industry practice, tax advice we have received in some cases from third parties (including legal counsel), and similarities to facts and circumstances described in case law. These positions may relate to tax compliance (especially in the current international tax context tending towards enhanced mandatory disclosure obligations), classification of income, treaty relief and withholding tax, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues, including tax base. It is possible that the tax authorities will not agree with the views we have taken. From time to time, we are subject to tax audits, and any challenges from relevant tax authorities with respect to our application and interpretation of tax rules may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, and such adjustments may not be favorable to us. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor, they could result in significant additional tax liabilities and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A

In addition, the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains a springing financial maintenance covenant that is tested quarterly to the extent total cash drawings outstanding under the New Revolving Credit Facility (excluding any Utilizations of the Facility by way of Letters of Credit (or bank guarantees) and any Utilization of an Ancillary Facility other than, in each case, by way of cash drawing) on the last day of the relevant financial quarter are equal to or greater than 40% of the total commitment under the New Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Revolving Credit Facility”. The restrictions contained in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. For example, such restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, pursue our strategic initiatives, make investments, restructure our organization or finance our capital needs. Additionally, our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. These include prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If we breach any of these covenants or restrictions, we could be in default under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or the Indenture. If there were an event of default under any of our debt instruments that is not cured or waived, the holders of the defaulted debt could terminate their commitments thereunder and cause all amounts outstanding with respect to such indebtedness to be due and payable immediately, which in turn could result in cross-defaults or crossaccelerations under our other debt instruments, including the Notes. Any such actions could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation, and we may not be able to repay our obligations under the Notes in such an event. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes”. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service obligations, or our obligations under other financing agreements, in which case our creditors could declare all amounts owed to them due and payable, leading to liquidity constraints. Our ability to make interest payments on the Notes and to meet our other debt service obligations, including under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture, or to refinance our debt, depends on our future operating and financial performance, which in turn depends on our ability to successfully implement our business strategy as well as general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If we cannot generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements, we may, among other things, need to refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, obtain additional financing, delay planned capital expenditures or investments or sell material assets. If we are not able to refinance any of our debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to satisfy our 71 ----- debt obligations, including the Notes. If we are also unable to satisfy our obligations on other financing arrangements, we could be in default under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Indenture and other relevant financing agreements which we may enter into in the future. In the event of a default under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or certain other defaults under any other agreement, the lenders under the respective facilities or financing instruments could take certain actions, including terminating their commitments and declaring all amounts that we have borrowed under our credit facilities and any other indebtedness that we have incurred or may incur in the future to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. Such a default, or a failure to make interest payments on the Notes, could mean that borrowings under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, including the Notes and the New Revolving Credit Facility, may as a result also be accelerated and become due and payable. If the debt under the New Revolving Credit Facility or the Notes or any other material financing arrangement that we have entered into or will subsequently enter into were to be accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay the Notes in full. Any such actions could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation, and we might not be able to repay our obligations under the Notes in such an event.

Such subsidiaries will not have any obligations to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose unless they guarantee the Notes. Generally, holders of debt of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder. Accordingly, in the event that any non-guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent refinancing: - the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and 72 ----- - the creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

The holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral. Under French law the pledgee of a French law security interest and the creditor of the claim secured by such security interest are required to be the same person and such security interest cannot be held on behalf of third 73 ----- parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as fiduciary (fiduciaire) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agent (agent des sûretés) under Articles 2488-6 et seq. of the French Civil Code. The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents. The Security Agent will hold all security interests to be pledged as Collateral. As regards the security interests to be pledged as Collateral governed by the laws of France, the Security Agent will hold such security interests to be pledged as Collateral as security agent for the beneficiaries under Articles 2488-6 et seq. of the French Civil Code. Furthermore, in order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”). Although the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recognized, in a decision on Parallel Debt mechanisms (Cass. com. 13 September 2011 n°10-25.533 Belvédère) relating to bond documentation governed by New York law, the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent as Parallel Debt Creditor under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt. The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Indenture that become particularly important following Defaults or Events of Default, and acts in a fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the holders of the Notes. The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour de _cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. 13 September 2011 n°10-_ 25533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of 1[st] July 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will, subject to certain limited exceptions, act to enforce the security interests in the Collateral and take instructions from the relevant secured creditors in respect of the Collateral only at the direction of the “instructing group”. Subject to certain exceptions described below and in further detail in the section entitled “Description of Certain _Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement,” among other things, the “majority_ _pari passu creditors”_ (generally, creditors representing the simple majority of, among other things, the outstanding principal amount under the Notes and any pari passu secured indebtedness) shall constitute an instructing group and shall have the 74 ----- right to instruct the Security Agent as to the enforcement of the Collateral, _provided that such instructions are consistent with the “enforcement principles” set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. If, however: - the majority pari passu creditors have not either: (i) made a determination as to the method of enforcement and notified the Security Agent of that determination; or (ii) appointed a financial adviser to assist them in making such a determination, in each case, within three months of the date on which an instructing group delivers a copy of their proposed enforcement instructions (the “initial notice”); or - the “super senior discharge date” (as described in the section below entitled “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”) has not occurred within six months of the date of the initial notice; or - an insolvency event is continuing with respect to a member of the Group; or - the majority pari passu creditors have not either: (i) made a determination as to the method of enforcement and notified the Security Agent of that determination; or (ii) appointed a financial adviser to assist them in making a determination, and the “majority super senior creditors” (as described below): (a) determine in good faith that a delay in issuing enforcement instructions could have a material adverse effect on the ability to effect a distressed disposal or on the expected realization proceeds of any enforcement; and (b) deliver enforcement instructions they believe to be consistent with the enforcement principles before the Security Agent has received instructions from the majority pari passu creditors; then the Security Agent shall, instead follow the instructions that are subsequently given by the “majority super senior creditors” (generally, creditors representing more than 66.67% of the aggregate of all unpaid and undrawn commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility and the termination value or assumed termination value of certain hedging liabilities), provided that such instructions are consistent with the “enforcement principles” set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. The foregoing security enforcement arrangements could be disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes in a number of respects. Disputes may occur between the holders of the Notes and creditors under our New Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to the relevant hedging obligations or holders of any permitted additional indebtedness as to the appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement remedies and strategies with respect to the Collateral securing such obligations. In such an event, the holders of the Notes will be bound by any decisions of the instructing group, which may result in enforcement action in respect of the relevant collateral, whether or not such action is approved by the holders of the Notes or may be adverse to such noteholders. The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the enforcement sale of any Collateral will be subject to, as a condition to the release of any claims of any other indebtedness secured by such collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement, certain protections intended to maximize the cash recovery from an enforcement sale. The creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to certain hedging obligations or the holders of any permitted additional indebtedness may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may elect to pursue their remedies under the relevant security documents at a time when it would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so. In addition, other creditors not party to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence enforcement actions against the Issuer or its subsidiaries, the Issuer or one or more of its subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain Collateral could otherwise be impaired or reduced in value. In addition, if we incur substantial additional indebtedness which may be secured by security interests in the Collateral, the holders of the Notes may not constitute the requisite majority of pari passu creditors for the purposes of instructing the Security Agent.

In France, the enforcement of the Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured over such Collateral, as applicable, under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such a Guarantee or security interest in the Collateral is not in the grantor’s corporate interests, or the burden of such security interest exceeds the benefit to the relevant grantor, or such guarantee or security interest would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and would cause the directors of such subsidiary grantor, in certain jurisdictions, to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. In France, the liabilities and obligations under the Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral are subject to (i) certain exceptions, including any obligations which, if incurred, would constitute prohibited financial assistance within the meaning of Article L.225-216 of the French _Code de Commerce or infringement of the provisions of Articles L.242-6 or L.244-1 of the French _Code de Commerce; and (ii) a financial limitation corresponding to an amount equal to the proceeds from the offering of the Notes which the Issuer have applied for the direct benefit of each French Guarantor through intercompany loans. By virtue of this limitation, each French Guarantor’s obligations under the Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes or a French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under the Guarantee and the security interest in the Collateral. French law requires that, when a French company grants a guarantee of third-party obligations, the guarantee must be in the corporate purpose and corporate interest of the guarantor company. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance.

Under French law, pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. Enforcement by way of private sale may not be agreed at the time of granting of the security, and therefore, holders of the Notes will not benefit from such enforcement method. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosure securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial foreclosure or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of contractual foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, 76 ----- the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral. Consequently, in the event that the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the holders of the Notes are entitled to, and decide to, enforce the Collateral, as the case may be, which consists of a pledge over the shares of each Issuer, through judicial or private foreclosure, and the value of such shares exceeds the amount of the secured debt, the holders of the Notes may be required to pay immediately to the relevant pledgors a “soulte” equal to the amount by which the value of such shares exceeds the amount of the secured debt. If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect. Alternatively, an enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities, since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies.",,,,N/A

The Collateral will also secure on a first-ranking basis our obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations. In addition, the Collateral may also secure additional debt to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of holders of the Notes to the Collateral may be diluted by any increase in the first-priority debt secured by the Collateral. Not all of the respective Issuer’ assets will secure, directly or indirectly, the Notes. The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, the condition of the French economy and the availability of buyers. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, there can be no assurance that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in its liquidation. In addition, the pledges, shares and ownership interests of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding because all of the obligations of the entity must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the entity.",,,,N/A

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens, loss of legal perfection and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or characterization under the laws of France. The security interests will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. The Issuer cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. The Issuer also cannot assure you that the consents of any third 77 ----- parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. Furthermore, due consideration should be given by investors to the circumstance that enforcement procedures and timing for obtaining judicial decisions in France may be materially more complex and time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar.",,,,N/A

See “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of the Security”. Unless consented to by the holders of the Notes (and subject to certain exceptions), the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent shall not, in an enforcement scenario, exercise its rights to release the security interests in the Collateral unless, among other things, the relevant sale or disposal is made: - for consideration of which all or substantially all is in the form of cash; and - pursuant to a public auction, or if a fairness opinion has been obtained from an internationally recognized investment bank, accountancy firm or other valuation professional services firm selected by the Security Agent. The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the Collateral may be released and retaken in connection with the refinancing of certain indebtedness, including the Notes. Under certain circumstances, other creditors, insolvency administrators or representatives or courts could challenge the validity and enforceability of the grant of the Collateral. Any such challenge, if successful, could potentially limit your recovery in respect of the Collateral and thus reduce your recovery under the Notes.

The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under any indebtedness that the Issuer have incurred or may incur in the future (including, in the case of the Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility), even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from their subsidiaries to allow them to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a change of control may be limited by the Group’s then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when the Issuer’s subsidiaries are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, the Issuer’s subsidiaries may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to fund the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, the Issuer expects that they would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. There can be no assurance that the Issuer would be able to obtain such financing. The Issuer’s failure to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which could, in turn, constitute a default under certain other indebtedness. See “Description of the Notes—Purchase of Notes upon _a Change of Control”._ The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring or other similar refinancings involving the Issuer that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “change of control” as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Purchase of Notes upon a Change of Control”, the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, recapitalization or similar refinancing. The definition of “change of control” in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of each Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, as applicable, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular refinancing would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of each of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer are required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes. 79 -----",,,,N/A

The interests of our shareholders as equity holders may conflict with your interests as a noteholder. Such shareholders may have an incentive to increase the value of their respective investments or cause the Issuer to distribute funds at the expense of our financial condition and affect the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes. In addition, they may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings, capital expenditures or other refinancings that they believe could enhance their equity investments even though such refinancings might involve risks to the holders of the Notes.

See “Principal Shareholders and Related Party Transactions— _Cash management agreement”. Under the BH Cash Management Agreement, the Issuer will advance to BH a_ portion of its cash on balance sheet to facilitate the deposit of such cash with certain financial institutions on its behalf in order to optimize its cash management and increase the return on its cash investments. BH can only invest this cash in liquid and risk-free financial instruments. The Issuer’s consolidated free cash will be subject to this arrangement. All funds the Issuer will advance to BH, and all securities purchased with such funds, and proceeds of all of the foregoing, are deposited in segregated accounts in the name of BH, and these accounts are pledged to the Issuer to secure BH’s obligations under the BH Cash Management Agreement. The Issuer’s receivables under the Cash Management Agreement will in turn be pledged to the Security Agent for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of Notes to secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the New Revolving Credit Facility. Under the BH Cash Management Agreement, the Issuer will have the right at any time to require BH to repay it any cash or other property held on its behalf by BH thereunder, subject to reasonable notice. However, the Issuer’s ability to enforce this right may be suspended in the context of certain French insolvency proceedings involving BH. Moreover, even though the Security Agent can, on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of Notes, enforce the pledge of the Issuer’s receivables under the BH Cash Management Agreement, thereby giving it a direct claim against BH on behalf of the holders of Notes, its ability to enforce this direct claim would be similarly adversely affected under such circumstances. Therefore, if BH were to become subject to insolvency proceedings, the Issuer’s ability to access the cash and other property held by BH on our behalf may be legally blocked, and the amount of such cash and other property may be significant. Moreover, the Issuer does not control BH, and, since BH is not in the restricted group under the Indenture or the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, it is not subject to the covenants set out therein. Therefore, the ability of the holders to monitor and assess any potential for insolvency at the level of BH or to prevent it from taking actions that would violate the BH Cash Management Agreement or be inconsistent with the interests of the holders is very limited.

No later than 60 days after the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by the Post-Closing Collateral, as further described under “Description of _the Notes—Security”. We intend to take all actions such that the Notes are secured by the Post-Closing Collateral_ within 60 days after the Issue Date. There can, however, be no assurance that we will be successful in procuring such security interests within the time period specified or at all. The Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors within 60 days from the Issue Date, _provided that (x) such guarantees shall in each case be granted substantially simultaneously with the guarantees granted in favor of obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and subject to any requirements therein (and for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be required to be granted any earlier than those obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) and (y) are in all cases subject to the Agreed Security Principles. We will agree in the Indenture to take such necessary actions so that the Guarantors become guarantors of the Notes by executing and delivering to the Trustee one or more supplemental indentures substantially in the form attached to the Indenture. Prior to such accession, the Guarantors will have no direct obligations under the Indenture and holders of the Notes will have no direct claim on their assets. If one of such Guarantors were to become subject to insolvency proceedings or would otherwise be considered insolvent under the insolvency test discussed under “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees _and the Collateral—France—Insolvency Test” between the Issue Date and the date on which such Guarantee is_ put in place, holders of the Notes would face a greater risk of such Guarantee being invalidated, which could impair your recovery under the relevant Guarantee.

Applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer, the enforceability of a Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the security interests in the Collateral. Such courts may also in certain circumstances void the security interest or a Guarantee where the company is close to or near insolvency. In France, among other limitations, the granting of the security interests in the Collateral in connection with the issuance of the Notes may fall under the legal framework of hardening periods where certain arrangements or dispositions that are made during a specified period (the “hardening period”) preceding the opening order of reorganization proceedings or liquidation proceedings may be challenged by the receiver, the judicial administrator or the public prosecutor in bankruptcy and certain creditors under the applicable rules of avoidance. 81 ----- Indeed, while opening reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, a French Court will set the date on which the debtor is deemed to have become insolvent (date de cessation des paiements). This date can be fixed at any time up to 18 months prior to the judgement opening the proceedings (subject to certain exceptions). The period between the date of insolvency and the commencement of insolvency proceedings is known as the hardening period. The Indenture also permits the security interests in the Collateral to be released and retaken in certain circumstances. At each time, if the security interest were granted or recreated during the hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective or it may not be possible to enforce it. For more information see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability _of the Guarantees and the Collateral”. In France, insolvency legislation tends to favor the continuation of a_ business and protection of employment over the payment of creditors. In the context of insolvency proceedings affecting creditors, including court-assisted pre-insolvency proceedings (mandat ad hoc proceedings or conciliation proceedings (procédure de conciliation)), and court-controlled insolvency proceedings (safeguard proceedings, accelerated safeguard (sauvegarde accélérée) and reorganization or liquidation proceedings (redressement ou liquidation judiciaire)), the ability of holders of the Notes to enforce their rights under the Notes could be limited or suspended. For more information regarding insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Guarantees and security interests in the Collateral, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity _and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral”._ In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries, or any other grantor of security interests in the Collateral, experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, administration or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. Rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral are likely to be subject to insolvency and administrative laws of more than one jurisdiction and there can be no assurance that the holders of the Notes will be able to effectively enforce their rights in complex proceedings. The application of these laws may also conflict with each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void preferential transfer, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your rights under the Guarantees and limit any amounts that you may realize from the Collateral.",,,,N/A

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment-grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

The Floating Rate Notes will bear a variable rate based on the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”), plus an applicable margin, and the New Revolving Credit Facility bears a variable rate based on the EURIBOR, plus an applicable margin. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Floating Rate Notes. Neither the Indenture nor the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contain a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. Although we may enter into certain hedging arrangements to fix a portion of these interest rates, there can be no assurance that any such current or future hedging arrangements will adequately protect our operating results from the effects of interest rate fluctuations or will not result in losses or that our risk management practices and procedures will operate successfully. If we determine that EURIBOR has been permanently discontinued or, at the request of the Issuer or the agent under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (acting on the instructions of the majority lenders), the agent will use an alternative reference rate in the manner as described in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, and the rate of interest on the Floating Rate Notes will be determined for the relevant period by the fallback provisions applicable to such Floating Rate Notes.",,,,N/A

Most of the members of the board of directors, supervisory board and all of the senior management of the Issuer and the Group are non-residents of the United States. Although the Parent, the Issuer and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on its or its subsidiaries’ directors and executive officers. In addition, as the assets of the Parent, the Issuer and its subsidiaries and those of their respective directors and executive officers are generally located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with France. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability of civil liabilities based upon U.S. federal securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in France. In addition, the enforcement in France of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court based on civil liabilities, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions.

You should carefully consider the following risks, together with other information provided to you in this Offering Memorandum, in deciding whether to invest in the Notes. The occurrence of any of the events discussed below could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. If these events occur, the trading prices of the Notes could decline, and we may not be able to pay all or part of the interest or principal on the Notes, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial could also adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition or our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and affect your investment. Further, to the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this section. This Offering Memorandum contains “forward-looking” statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward- looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See “Forward-Looking Statements.”_",,,,N/A
57,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.25,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.25.1,"The effects of the outbreak of COVID-19 have disrupted our operations, which have had and may continue to have a material negative adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.","The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the global economy due to the implementation of a wide variety of control measures including states of emergency, “shelter in place” orders, border closures, closures of businesses, and restrictions on commuting, local and international travel, shopping, social and recreational activities and gatherings. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted our results. The volume of traffic at our car parks is dependent on mobility, and in particular people travelling to locations such as places of employment, shopping centers, leisure facilities, hospitals, airports, offices and urban areas. Beginning in February at our facilities in Italy and across Europe at certain airports and at all our other facilities in March, our car park usage reduced drastically as a result of the restrictions on movement and other social distancing measures imposed by governments in Europe in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For a number of weeks early in 2020 our short-term parking revenues came to a virtual standstill because people worked from home, were only allowed or advised to go out for essential or permitted purposes and most places that people tend to drive to were no longer accessible. The effect of these measures on the volume of traffic at our facilities was most severe in the period March to May 2020. Following the easing of restrictions during the second quarter of the year, customers immediately started to return to our facilities; however at most we only reached on average 80% of levels of volume of customers at our facilities in the comparable period in 2019. Travel in the countries in which we operate, however, in the second quarter of 2020 remained significantly below the levels in the comparable period in 2019. Increasing infections and hospitalizations led to the reinstatement of government restrictions from October 2020 onwards. All the countries in which we operate experienced various degrees of lockdowns which have continued in many of the countries in which we operate through the first and second quarters of 2021, which have significantly negatively impacted our revenues. The COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects to a number of risks. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, our revenues and profitability. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic made it difficult for us to satisfy liquidity requirements during 2020 due to a sharp decline in our car park usage and could continue to make it difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations or obtain financing on favorable terms, or at all, which could generally impact our costs and our ability to increase revenue in the future. As part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we reduced or postponed investments and expenses, introduced short-time working and reduced or deferred lease and rental ----- payments in agreement with landlords and partners. We took out government-guaranteed loans in Switzerland and benefited from one-off governmental subsidies from various government capital infusion programs designed to alleviate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses in the jurisdictions where we operate. We required an amendment to our credit facility in order to prevent a default and raised capital from our shareholders and third-party lenders. Despite the steps we have taken to assess and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects is uncertain. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities, and financing is not otherwise available to us from borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility or other sources, we may not be able to cover our expenses, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, all of which would harm our business. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance, including our ability to execute our near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, the rollout of vaccines, continued governmental restrictions and new strains or variants of the disease against which existing vaccines might be ineffective as well as the extent of the recovery of business and economic conditions in general, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. We estimate that a partial recovery of the economy may present substantial risks to our business and operations, as in that scenario occupancy levels at our facilities are likely to remain below pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, which would negatively impact our profitability, while our ability to benefit from governmental assistance would be substantially reduced due to the likelihood of termination of COVID-19 related financial support programs and furlough schemes. In addition, in that scenario our landlords may be more reluctant to provide any relief on our lease payments. The potential effects and long-term impact of COVID-19 could intensify or otherwise affect many of the other risks set forth herein or present other unforeseen consequences for our business.",,,,N/A
57,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.25,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.25.2,"Changes in individual behavior, including in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, may lead to a decline in parking demand, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.","New customer behavior, such as an increase in online shopping and working from home, or changes in the popularity of certain stores or locations, including as a result of permanent store, restaurant or entertainment venue closures, poses a risk of a decreased demand for parking facilities and may have an adverse effect on our business and revenue. Changes in customer behavior accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic and may continue to do so in the aftermath of the pandemic as the majority of the population in the markets where we operate has progressively adapted to the restrictive measures implemented in 2020 and 2021 and has increasingly relied on alternative solutions for leisure and professional needs. Complete and partial closure of shopping centers, leisure amenities and offices and the rapid growth of online retail, grocery shopping and food delivery services during the COVID-19 shutdown have resulted in a drastic reduction of visits to city centers. The COVID-19 lockdowns may have changed shopping behavior for the long-term, and customers may purchase more products online in the future. For instance, in Germany, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, trade fairs have been organized in a different set-up with fewer visitors and a substantial number of main street venues have gone out of business. Significantly decreased national and international travel, reduction in the number of flights and the closure of airports has led to the rapid development of remote working and virtual meetings solutions. Business travel is one of our most profitable business segments, and it might never fully recover because of the continued use of virtual meetings. Reduced travel will also impact hotel parking volume and may result in a decrease in parking at large events, such as sporting events and concerts. These changes in customer behavior and the emergence of alternative solutions for leisure and professional needs may be permanent or remain for the long-term, which may result in part of the parking volumes not recovering to the pre-COVID-19 levels in the long-term in each of the sectors in which we operate, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business. Reliance by customers on online services and progressive shifts by employers to flexible working solutions may continue in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and may result in a decline in ##### 38 ----- parking demand in cities and urban areas as well as transportation hubs such as train stations and airports, which could have a negative impact on our business. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, 11.4% of our revenue was generated by contract parking, where customers have monthly or annual passes at our facilities. This has generally been a valuable, recurring portion of our revenues. If many of these customers choose to work from home full-time or even part-time, they may not park in our facilities any longer, or may not buy monthly or annual passes. Moreover, a slight decrease in the average parking time that may result from new customer behavior coupled with a lower occupancy rate of our car parks could have substantial negative impact on our revenue. We have generally relied upon the historical trends towards urbanization in developing our value-creation initiatives. However, many people are leaving cities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and are choosing to live in rural areas and work remotely. A material decline in the number of people living in urban areas could have a material impact on the volume of cars using our facilities. In addition, changing customer habits as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that are long-lasting, for example less frequent or shorter shopping times, utilization of different modes of transportation and reduced in-person gatherings, may have a materially detrimental effect on our business.",,,,N/A

In particular, the long-term economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are unknown at this time. A downturn in economic conditions resulting in high unemployment rates, reduced customer spending, increased bankruptcy filings, increased interest rates, high inflation, fluctuations in the availability or cost of funding, fluctuations in the value of currency or a decline in the strength of national and local economies in which we operate and other factors that may negatively affect our end customers’ financial prospects could affect the mobility rates of our end customers. The number of people visiting shopping centers, restaurants, offices and city centers generally declines during periods of increased inflation and economic downturn. As a result, a decline in economic conditions could lead to a decline in the volume of cars parked at our facilities.",,,,N/A
57,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.25,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.25.4,"A large portion of our operations are carried out, and revenue is generated in Europe and Germany, in particular. Any adverse political or economic changes within these markets may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.","All of our business operations are located in Europe. Our business in Germany accounted for approximately 33% of our Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution in the financial year ended December 31, 2019. In light of this concentration, our business is sensitive to political or economic developments that effect Europe and Germany in particular. Concerns regarding the debt burden of certain European countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual member states of the EU could have an outsized adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.",,,,N/A
57,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.25,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.25.5,Customer driven changes in transportation habits may result in a reduction in cars parked at our facilities.,"Changes in the transportation industry could have a negative impact on our business, such as increased use of public transport by end customers and car sharing. The increased use of ride sharing services and alternative public or private transport providers, and the development of autonomous vehicles, are two trends that are particularly pronounced in larger cities. Such trends may lead to a decline in parking demand in cities and urban areas as well as in transportation hubs, such as train stations and airports. The increase in the accessibility of transportation hubs by alternative public or private transport providers such as trains, shuttles and ride sharing services may lead to a decreased need for car parks. Car share programs reduce the need for parking spots as multiple motorists can share a single vehicle. ##### 39 ----- Further development of pedestrian or bike pathways and general green initiatives like congestion charges which are meant to reduce automobile traffic in urban areas could reduce customers at our car parks. While we devote considerable effort and resources to analyzing and responding to customer preferences and changes to customer preferences in the markets in which we operate, customer preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly. We have invested in positioning ourselves to benefit from trends such as experience shopping and urbanization, but these trends may turn out to be less resilient than expected or even may reverse.",,,,N/A
57,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.25,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.25.6,Significant competition in our markets may adversely affect customers’ desire to park at our facilities.,"The parking industry is highly competitive. We believe that customer choice regarding parking is driven partly by price but also by factors such as location, lighting and security and the ease of parking in particular as a result of payment apps. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources available than us. For example, some of our key competitors include Empark and Q-Park, each of which has substantial financial, marketing and other resources and established brand names. Our competitors could use their significant resources to increase their marketing, develop new services or technology or reduce their prices in a manner that adversely impacts our ability to charge prices that generate the same margins we have earned in the past, or at all. We cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors. Furthermore, new technology and processes could negatively impact our existing business. For example, continued use of digital technology to operate parking facilities might diminish the need for physical controls by our parking officers and therefore the need for certain of our services. In addition, we currently generate a significant percentage of our revenue from consumers who fail to pay their invoices on time or at all (i.e., through late fees and related administration fees), which may decrease as more advance parking technology becomes available. Furthermore, increased use of technology could also lead to new competitors providing parking services, pushing us towards the role of a facility manager with reduced spread in the business, which could make our large number of parking facility locations less valuable, reduce our bargaining powers with our clients and reducing our margins. We also compete with certain property owners and businesses that operate their own parking facilities. Such entities may be able to charge lower prices than us because they are seeking to generate revenue through products sold in their stores, as opposed to parking revenue.",,,,N/A
57,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.25,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.25.7,"Changes in environmental and traffic control regulations could reduce demand for, and volumes in, our off-street parking facilities that could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial conditions.","National or local governments could implement measures which are potentially unfavorable to the parking sector as a result of pressure from public opinion, advocacy groups, or election results. For example, proposals relating to limiting traffic within city boundaries or the introduction of bans on driving of diesel vehicles in certain cities could adversely affect inner-city parking, resulting in lower revenue and diminished profitability. As an example, a number of car parking spaces in Copenhagen are expected to be converted to flexible parking spaces for both bicycles and cars. The local authority in Copenhagen also introduced the “Cyclist Priority Plan for 2017-2025,” which seeks to encourage 50% of commuting journeys to be completed by bicycle. In addition, certain of the cities in which we operate have introduced dedicated bike lanes in response to changes in traffic patterns and to tackle environmental concerns. Such initiatives are likely to continue in the future. Governments will likely continue to implement further measures aimed at reducing car traffic and availability of parking spaces, additional regulation to provide free parking for staff, patients and visitors at hospitals and other public places, and regulation with respect to the amount of permitted fines and surcharges that we may charge, thereby affecting our income. Some municipalities may impose traffic congestion charges in urban areas, reduce the availability of on-street parking spaces or promote the use of public transportation in lieu of automobiles. In addition, certain municipalities may measure and charge for curb time parking, which could encourage courier and package delivery services to use transportation methods other than cars. Governments may also ##### 40 ----- increase the tax levels on automobiles and petroleum for environmental reasons, which may reduce traffic. Social perception and pressure relating to environmental concerns over the use of private cars may similarly adversely impact the demand for our facilities. In addition, municipalities may promote environmentally-friendly initiatives by reducing the number of parking spaces and encourage the use of public transport for attendees of large public events and gatherings, trade fairs and transportation hubs. Furthermore, the government in certain cities may reduce the parking tariffs of their parking facilities in order to compete with other cities and private companies. We may also be materially adversely affected by temporary or permanent changes to traffic routes or road closures, which may make it more difficult to access our parking facilities and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic, certain municipalities in Austria and Italy also imposed “free parking” to accelerate the recovery of inner-cities or to support essential workers. If these free parking arrangements were to be extended or expanded, our results of operations could be affected.",,,,N/A
57,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.25,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.25.8,"We have a large amount of fixed costs, and if we experience a decrease in our revenue, our operating expenses and rent payments will not decrease at the same rate, which could have a material adverse effect on our net cash flows, margins and profits.","Many of the expenses associated with operating parking facilities are relatively fixed. These expenses include a large portion of our rent expenses, personnel costs, information technology costs, maintenance and repair and cleaning costs, insurance and utilities. If we are unable to decrease our costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our parking spaces decreases, the decline in our revenue can have a particularly adverse effect on our net cash flows and profits. This effect can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth. Where cost cutting efforts are insufficient to offset declines in revenue, in particular in respect of our leased car parking facilities, we could experience a material decline in margins and potentially negative cash flows which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We may also be unable to terminate on short notice or renegotiate unprofitable or disadvantageous leases or management contracts. In addition, we may be required to honor our contractual lease provisions or possibly pay considerable amounts in compensation or damages. Furthermore, our auditors may require us to book onerous contract provisions in relation to unprofitable or disadvantageous leases or management contracts, which may significantly increase our operating loss. These lease agreements may negatively impact our profitability, and may have significant adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we may be required to recognize unprofitable or disadvantageous leases or management contracts as onerous contracts under IAS 37 and record a provision in our financial statements for the loss we expect to make on such contracts. This may negatively impact our EBITDA and our leverage ratios under the restrictive debt covenants to which we will be subject and consequently limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities.

While the largest owners and operators in the industry are municipalities, other large competitors include divisions of diversified global corporations with substantial financial, management and other resources and capabilities. In Western Europe, many long-term parking lease contracts and management contracts for parking facilities are awarded and renewed through competitive tenders. A significant number of competing entities may bid on a parking facility tender. Generally, public tenders for on- and off-street leases and ##### 41 ----- off-street management contracts are competitive and primarily determined based on economic terms. Some of our competitors or new entrants to the market may be able to bid at lower prices, or offer additional incentives such as upgrades to the facility. They may be able to realize synergies or operate the facility in as part of a cluster, which would allow them to charge higher parking tariffs. We also may underestimate our cost to run a new facility, or we may overestimate the amount of volume that a new facility will generate, and our bid may contemplate rental or operating costs that are too high for the applicable facility to support. In such a case a facility may turn out to be unprofitable because we are paying too much in rent or are generating too little in management fees. In such a situation, that facility will negatively impact our margins and EBITDA. In addition, certain landlords, including municipalities, may choose not to retender a car park once it has expired, but rather in-source and operate the car parks themselves. This decision on the part of the landlord can result in a loss of revenue or the loss of opportunity to tender for a competitor’s former lease and increased competition for other car parks. As a result of such competition we may not be able to win new tenders or renew tenders on commercially favorable terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.",,,,N/A

The awarding party may contractually modify a tender agreement for public interest reasons that may affect the terms of the service provision or the price of tariffs paid by users. Additionally, unsuccessful bidders may challenge the decision of an awarding authority before the courts. Any decision adopted by a granting authority with respect to a competitive bidding process may be challenged be a third party provided this party has a legitimate interest in the result of the annulment of such decision. There can be no assurance that our right to contracts we have won through a competitive bidding process will be upheld.

There may be significant competition to renew existing leases or management contracts. This risk is more pronounced where the contract is with a public authority and where a bidding process is required as opposed to with a private landlord where we can initiate bilateral discussions ahead of upcoming lease expirations. Approximately 33% of our revenue in 2019 was with public or quasi-public authorities versus with private landlords. The loss of, or the renewal on less commercially favorable terms of, a significant number of our existing facilities, or one or more of our largest facilities, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. We are also subject to the termination rights set forth in the terms and conditions in our agreements. For example, in some of our contracts, a change in our shareholders may trigger the counterparty’s right to terminate the lease or management contract. A counterparty may also seek to terminate if we are not meeting our contractual requirements under the contract, such as maintenance obligations.

Sophisticated information technology and other systems, including systems for the efficient collection and management of revenue are integral to our business. In order to maintain the quality of our operations, we refine, update or replace our information technology and other systems with more advanced systems on a regular basis. Motorists increasingly use mobile phone applications and online parking reservation services that allow them to reserve parking at garages, lots and directly with individual owners. As a result, we constantly develop new applications and upgrade our information technology to adapt to changing preferences, to keep up with market demand for new services and to match services offered by our competitors. For example, in 2018 we also launched our APCOA FLOW system, which is an open, digital and scalable cloud-based platform which connects most of our parking garages, including parking technology, with our customers and their vehicles via smartphone apps. This system also provides real time data on occupancy and availability of our parking facilities. Our competitors may develop more efficient or popular solutions, which could attract more customers seeking to park their cars and could affect our business, operations and revenues. Developing and maintaining our systems will require significant capital. If we are unable to introduce information technology and other systems as quickly as our competitors our ability to compete effectively could be diminished. If we are unable to replace outdated or broken systems within budgeted costs or on schedule, our operations could be harmed.

Additionally, approximately 33% of 2019 revenue was with municipalities or other public or quasipublic entities. If a municipality with which we have an agreement faces financial difficulties we may be exposed to certain risks such as poorly maintained infrastructure in the areas surrounding and servicing the relevant facilities. Furthermore, certain municipalities facing financial challenges may be reluctant or unwilling to pay compensation amounts to which we are entitled under the relevant agreements. As a result, we may be required to initiate legal proceedings. This risk would be further exacerbated by an economic downturn in Europe. If a municipality with whom we have a contract experiences financial difficulties we are still obliged to continue providing services under our long-term contracts, regardless of outstanding revenues or compensation owed, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition ##### 44 -----",,,,N/A

Accordingly, market dynamics make it possible for large private players to acquire small competitors at attractive multiples and as such, we are focused on growing in part through acquisitions. We expect to continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire businesses that complement our operations. However, there can be no assurance that any acquisition we make in the future will deliver the anticipated benefits. In addition, the process of integrating an acquired business may create unforeseen difficulties, take longer than expected, result in the incurrence of unexpected costs and expenses or we ##### 45 ----- may not realize the synergies or operational advantages expected. The risks we face in connection with any potential acquisition of a business include, but are not limited to: - management time and focus may be diverted from operating our business to acquisition integration; - clients or key employees of an acquired business may not remain, which could negatively impact our ability to grow that acquired business; - we may face competition from management or key employees of an acquired business in case of their departure; - integration of the acquired business’s accounting, information technology, human resources, and other administrative systems may fail to permit effective management and expense reduction; - implementing internal controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a public company in an acquired business that lacked some of these controls, procedures and policies may fail; - additional indebtedness incurred as a result of an acquisition may impact our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows; and - unanticipated or unknown operational, commercial or technical issues or liabilities may arise relating to the acquired business. If we fail to identify and enter into attractive markets, to identify and operate facilities on acceptable terms, to attract, hire and retain skilled staff, to implement the appropriate infrastructure or to raise the required funds to successfully complete acquisitions, our business plans may be jeopardized and the intended consolidation or increase of our market share may fail to materialize, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.",,,,N/A

The financial information for the twelve months presented in this Offering Memorandum includes nonGAAP measures and is based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable and may differ materially from the actual amounts. We also present Pro Forma Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA, which gives effect to the estimated full-year effect of certain acquisitions, contract wins or contract terminations as if each of such event had occurred on January 1, 2019, and in the case of acquisitions and contract wins, including assumptions about the performance of such acquisition or contract during the first twelve months of ownership or execution by us.

Furthermore, Pro Forma Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA is calculated assuming the EBITDA achieved by the Company in 2019, rather than 2020 or the twelve months ended March 31, 2021. Because of the material adverse effects that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our business, we do not believe EBITDA from 2020 or the twelve months ended March 31, 2021 is an accurate reflection of our long-term business going forward. ##### 46 ----- Nevertheless, we cannot give any assurance that our EBITDA or other financial results will return to the levels of 2019.

For example, in 2016 one of our employees in Norway stole approximately €0.5 million in coins from parking meter change drawers over a period of approximately three years, and in the past we have had similar theft instances in other jurisdictions. While we have a compliance program and internal policies in place to mitigate the risks of theft, fraud, bribery, corruption and privacy breaches in the contract tender processes we engage in and for our business as a whole, we cannot assure that we can detect or prevent every instance of theft, fraud, bribery, corruption or breaches of privacy involving our employees, business partners or agents. We may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and to reputational damage as a result of such incidents. Instances of theft, fraud, bribery, corruption and breaches of privacy may also be taken into account as a negative factor by public authorities or private companies in evaluating our bids to acquire or renew contracts. Such incidents could result in a prohibition to tender for, or could otherwise prevent us from winning or renewing contracts, or make it more difficult for us to win or renew contracts in the future. Any involvement or association of our senior management, employees, business partners, suppliers or agents with theft, fraud, bribery, corruption and breaches of privacy, or allegations or rumors relating thereto, could negatively impact our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. For example, in 2018 we lost an on-street tender in Antwerp, Belgium, due to reputational issues resulting from a former fraud case in that city that was first identified in 2016, where one of our former technical directors was found guilty of large scale theft after we uncovered that he had stolen approximately €5 million in coins from parking meter change drawers over a period of at least five years, and in the past we had similar, albeit smaller, case of theft in other jurisdictions.

This paragraph draws attention to note “43 Group Risk Management— Going Concern” of the notes to our 2019 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, where the executive directors describe that in connection with the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern depends on the timing of the recovery of the business and hence, the achievement of the Group’s forecast earnings and cash flows, and respectively, the continuing financial support of the shareholders and the core banks. As stated in the note “43 Group Risk Management—Going Concern” in the notes to our 2019 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, these events and conditions indicate along with other matters stated there that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and that represents a risk that the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is threatened pursuant to section 322 paragraph 2 sentence 3 of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch— HGB). The audit opinion on the 2019 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements is not modified in respect of this matter. None of our financial information included in this Offering Memorandum, including our 2019 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, include any adjustments that may result from this uncertainty. The auditor’s report on our 2020 Audited Financial Statements does not contain an emphasis of matter paragraph, as the various measures taken by the Group to counteract the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations were deemed sufficient to ensure the Group’s status as a going concern, secure capital and liquidity by providers of equity and debt capital and to safeguard against further negative developments from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the COVID19 pandemic has had and continues to have a substantial impact on our business, primarily due to a significant reduction in volume of traffic at our car parks as a result of the restrictions on movement and other social distancing measures imposed by governments in Europe in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Risks Related to our Business and Industry—The effects of the outbreak of COVID-19 _have disrupted our operations, which have had and may continue to have a negative adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.” Our ability to forecast our pace_ of recovery from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the eventual levels to which our results of operations will return as well as our cash flows are dependent on when and the extent to which we can return to our pre-pandemic operating levels. Although our 2020 Audited Financial Statements do not contain an emphasis of matter paragraph, if one or more of the assumptions in making our assessment to report as a going concern are found to be incorrect, we may be unable to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we would have to liquidate our assets and may receive less that the value at which those assets are carried on our 2020 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and investors could lose a part or all of their investment in the Notes. ##### 48 -----",,,,N/A

In addition, some customer information and data is stored with third-parties who may also be subject to the risk of cyber-attack or access by unauthorized third-parties. Furthermore, the regulatory environment governing the use of individually identifiable data of customers, employees and others is complex. We must comply with data protection and privacy laws in the EU and other relevant jurisdictions, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation. Under the General Data Protection Regulation the relevant data protection authorities have the power to impose administrative fines for data protection compliance violations, including fines of up to a maximum of €20 million or 4% of the Group’s global annual turnover of the preceding financial year in certain cases. Privacy and information security laws and requirements change frequently and compliance with them may require us to incur costs to make necessary systems changes and implement new administrative processes. The implementation of any such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, any failure of our security systems or the security systems of third-parties that results in customer data or information becoming available to unauthorized third-parties may result in damage to our reputation and the loss of customers. This may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We are exposed to a variety of risks associated with credit and debit cards. In connection with credit and debit card payments, we pay interchange and other fees. These fees may increase over time and thus increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to increase our parking tariffs accordingly. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. Any failure to comply with applicable requirements or regulations may expose us to fines and higher transaction fees, the loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers or the cessation of payments from credit and debit card providers to us for purchases already made. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, any material failure by us or our service providers to maintain compliance with the payment card industry security requirements or to rectify a data security issue may result in fines and restrictions on our ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment. The regulatory framework for data privacy and protection with respect to credit card information is uncertain for the foreseeable future, and it is possible that legal and regulatory obligations may continue to increase and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent or possibly conflicting from one jurisdiction to another. In addition, changes in regulations that require us to update or replace our parking and operational infrastructure, including our points of payments and/or payment systems, may expose us to significant additional costs, which may have an adverse effect on our business. For example, changes to the Payment Card Industry standard have in the past required us (and may require us in the future) to ##### 49 ----- upgrade most of our points of payment and payment systems in certain of our jurisdictions of operations, which resulted in several million euros of additional costs.

Under the terms of our contracts, counterparties may terminate such agreements if we do not successfully comply with our obligations.","From time to time, we are involved in contractual and other disagreements with counterparties relating to our parking facilities and agreements and our operations under such agreements. Such disagreements are more likely to occur during periods of challenging economic conditions. We generally are required to maintain the relevant parking facility in satisfactory condition throughout the term of the contract, and upon the expiration of each agreement to turn over substantially all assets related to such agreement to the relevant counterparties without financial compensation. Certain of our contracts require us to sell our equipment at book value once a contract is terminated. If a counterparty claims that we have failed to comply with the terms of our agreements, the contract may be revoked or we may not be successful in extending or renewing the agreement at the end of its term, in either case we may have to compensate the counterparty as a result.

However, we may experience unforeseen problems such as water damage, cracks in the walls or foundation or sinking among other things, for which we may become liable if we fail to timely notify our landlords. In addition, under the terms of certain of our agreements in respect of parking facilities that we do not legally own, we are responsible for maintenance and upkeep. If we were to experience a significant problem requiring repairs, our maintenance costs may be higher than expected or we may be forced to suspend or reduce operations at the affected facility until such time as the issue is resolved. Such increased expenses or any reduction in revenue due to unexpected facility closures may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. From time to time we make investments in our properties to make them more attractive to customers or to increase the ways in which we can generate revenue at those properties. We are currently expanding our core business under the brand “APCOA Urban Hubs”. Through this program, we seek to use our parking areas for logistics, mobility, EV charging and new technologies services. For example, the introduction and popularity of electric cars requires investment in infrastructure, such as charging points and plug-ins, which may lead to increased infrastructure and energy costs in case we are unable to negotiate funding from our partners. Our investments will require capital, and we may not have sufficient liquidity to make such investments or to make our properties attractive to customers. Our investments may not draw new customers to our facilities and may not turn out to be profitable. In addition, we may experience unforeseen issues arising from alternative uses of our car parks which may prove to be costly to rectify. For example, if we see lower than expected demand for charging points and higher than expected demand for logistics and storage, we may be required to make additional investments to address customer demand and increase profitability of our facilities. ##### 50 ----- We manage the construction of two to three parking facilities on average each year. We are thus exposed to a number of risks associated with large-scale construction projects, such as the failure of our contractors and subcontractors to perform, as well as delays and disruptions caused by technical or environmental problems, adverse weather conditions or other factors. Generally, pursuant to the terms of the relevant agreements, our contractors and subcontractors are required to indemnify us for delays in completing the project on time and any losses resulting therefrom. Once the construction of a parking facility on a new site is completed, we are exposed to a variety of risks in connection with the opening and operation of the new parking facility, which could result in us failing to recover our investment in the new parking facility. For example, the actual demand for parking spaces at the new site may not meet our expectations, and we may experience lower than expected volumes and revenues. Further, in a small number of our contracts we are responsible not only for the maintenance and upkeep of the facilities that we construct but also for structural and mechanical repairs of such facilities which can lead to significantly increased expenses in case any unforeseen structural issues occur.",,,,N/A

We have collective bargaining arrangements in place in Sweden, Norway, Austria and Denmark (with respect to employees on our contract with the Billund Airport) which provide employment rights to our work force and may require us to expend greater time and cost to alter or amend employees’ terms of employment or discontinuing employment relationships. If we are made to negotiate additional collective bargaining arrangements with our work force in other jurisdictions where we operate, it could result in a substantial increase in labor costs that we may be unable to recover through our existing contractual arrangements. Further, under applicable law, we have works councils in The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and Denmark. We are required to seek such councils’ advice and consider any recommendations regarding certain business decisions we make from time to time and, for certain decisions, also seek such councils’ consent. Although we have not experienced any material collective labor disputes in the past and believe we currently enjoy good relationships with our works councils and employees, there can be no assurance that labor disputes will not arise in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, we may incur expenses in resolving disputes and complying with local laws relating to overtime, social security and pension contributions, occupational risk matters and other labor related issues. We may also incur increased labor costs due to competition, increased minimum wage, employee benefit costs, medical benefits costs or other factors, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations or financial condition. For example, a significant number of our employees are subject to minimum wage laws.

Natural disasters may also cause economic dislocations throughout urban areas, regions or countries. In addition, terrorist attacks have resulted in, and may continue to result in, heightened security and traffic control measures in urban areas and increased government regulation of airport facilities. For example, the terrorist attacks in large cities in the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Belgium could have a negative impact on customer travel and traffic levels in a number of locations where we operate parking facilities. Increased security protocols in airports and public perception of terrorist threats may lead customers to seek alternative means of transportation such as coaches or trains, in particular for national travel, which could have a negative impact on occupancy of our car parks at airports. The occurrence and consequences of such events are unpredictable, and further attacks could temporarily reduce traffic levels and decrease volumes for our parking facilities, thus causing a reduction in revenues. Our insurance may not be sufficient to cover claims arising from such events.

This seasonality in our demand, cost and profitability structures has resulted in fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations. Accordingly, seasonality in our operations could adversely affect our financial results. In particular, adverse factors, such as travel restriction measures during the third and fourth quarters of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, may have an outsized impact on our revenue because these quarters are important to our annual results. Volume at our parking facilities may also be impacted by adverse weather conditions.

Therefore, our commercial success depends on our ability to successfully defend our intellectual property, including trademarks, know how, client lists and domain names. In particular, we own key trademarks used by our companies, numerous domain names and certain other rights. We may also decide to file further trademark applications seeking to protect selected newly developed brands or concepts, or apply for registration of existing brands or concepts in other relevant jurisdictions as part of an international expansion, but cannot be sure that trademark registrations will be issued. There is also a risk that we could, by omission, fail to renew a trademark on a timely basis or that our competitors may challenge, invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, us. In addition, even though a trademark has been duly registered, under local regulation the fact that a trademark is not used for a certain period of time (such as five years in the EU) ##### 53 ----- may render the trademark registration voidable. Moreover, the effective and prior use of a name may prevail over the registration of the trademark. With respect to domain names, these are generally regulated by internet regulatory bodies and are also subject to trademark laws and other related laws of each country. If we do not have or cannot obtain or maintain on reasonable terms the ability to use our brands in a particular country, or to use or register a certain domain name, we could be forced either to incur significant additional expenses to market our services within that country, including the development of a new brand and the creation of new promotional materials and packaging, or to elect not to provide services in that country. Furthermore, there can be no assurance we will be able to adequately or sufficiently prevent infringement or misappropriation of our portfolio of intellectual property by thirdparties.

Tax laws and regulations are subject to change and may be subject to different interpretations (including, but not limited to, changes in applicable tax rates and requirements relating to deductibility of interest, withholding taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures). Any of the foregoing changes may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The structures of intra-group transactions and of our international operations, as well as judgments we make or positions we take relating to tax matters, are based on our own interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations, generally relying on rulings or specific guidance from competent tax authorities. We cannot guarantee that our interpretations of such laws will be accepted by the relevant authorities and there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will not seek to challenge or dispute such interpretations, and the current political climate and recent political and media focus on tax optimization schemes and austerity generally increases the risk of discussions or disputes with tax authorities. Any failure to comply with the tax laws or regulations applicable to us may result in reassessments, settlement amounts, late payment interest, fines and penalties and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, our operations that are profit making are subject to profit and income tax and other applicable taxes, such as property tax. There is no guarantee that tax laws or tax rates may not be changed in the future. Any change in tax laws or tax rates may increase our tax expenses and liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We may be subject to various tax proceedings and audits with tax authorities in respect of our operations. For example, APCOA Parking Italia S.p.A. received a tax assessment notice from the City of Avellino regarding charges and fees for occupying public land (TOSAP) for a total amount of €11.5 million for the 2013 to 2017 period (including interest and penalty surcharges). We successfully contested this assessment for the period from 2013 to April 2015 in the first and second instance, and the municipality filed an appeal. Our appeal against the notices for May 2015 to 2017 was rejected in the second instance, and we have appealed this decision. In addition to national tax laws, we are increasingly exposed to new taxes on regional and municipal levels in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Furthermore, in certain jurisdictions, parking fines are subject to VAT. Exposure to these additional taxes has a negative impact on our profitability and increases the risk of discussions or disputes with tax authorities. ##### 54 ----- We cannot assure you that we will not become subject to tax investigations in the future. If we were to become subject to such investigations, we may be held liable for additional tax payments, including penalties and interest for late payments, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that assessment is made. Any adverse findings of the relevant tax authorities could also result in unfavorable tax treatment for the transactions in question and could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any such investigations or challenges, such proceedings could result in substantial costs and may require that we devote substantial time and resources to defend ourselves. Also, a material change in applicable laws or regulations (including, but not limited to, changes in applicable tax rates), or in their interpretation or enforcement, could force us to alter our business strategy, leading to additional costs or loss of revenue, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.",,,,N/A

Certain of the industry data reports were commissioned prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and, as shown by the emergence of coronavirus variants, continues to develop and, accordingly, its end cannot be predicted. In addition, these assessments did not take into account the long-term structural and other effects of this pandemic on global economic activity or the near-term and medium-term effects of the countermeasures adopted to contain its spread, including the travel restrictions and bans and reductions in business and leisure airline travel, the practice of social distancing, quarantine advisories, shelter-in-place orders and closures of businesses, even once these measures are lifted. For example, many businesses have gone bankrupt or have otherwise been discontinued and unemployment rates in the markets in which we operate generally have increased significantly since the onset of the pandemic. Many employers have transitioned substantial portions of their employees to remote work arrangements and several multinational employers have announced that they do not expect for all of their employees to return to working in an office full-time or resume travelling at pre-pandemic rates once this pandemic has subsided. These announcements are indicative of significant structural economic changes caused by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional structural economic changes will likely emerge over the remainder of the pandemic, many of which we cannot yet anticipate. As a result, the post-COVID-19 pandemic economic and social environment in the markets in which we operate will likely differ significantly from the pre-COVID-19 pandemic economic and social environment in our markets.

We cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations on an ongoing basis or that we will remain cash flow positive once we take into account the debt service costs associated with the Notes. As of March 31, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had €718.0 million of outstanding indebtedness (on a pre-IFRS 16 basis), comprising the Notes, certain local credit facilities and pre-IFRS 16 finance lease obligations. In addition, we have €80 million commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, of which (i) €30.5 million will be made available as ancillary facilities pursuant to which bank guarantees may be issued, (ii) €17 million will be made available as ancillary facilities pursuant to which cash loans may be drawn, and (iii) €32.5 million will be available for utilization in accordance with the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility. The New Revolving Credit Facility is expected to be undrawn on the Issue Date, except for €20.1 million of noncash guarantees currently issued under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and Existing Guarantee Facility which will remain outstanding pursuant to the ancillary facilities described in the preceding sentence. The degree to which we will remain leveraged following the issuance of the Notes could have important consequences to holders of the Notes offered hereby, including, but not limited to: - making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes; - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions; - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow, and limiting the ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditure, acquisitions, joint ventures or other general corporate purposes; - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive environment and the industry in which we operate; - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged; and - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing. Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes. Despite our substantial leverage, we may still be able to incur more debt under the Indenture, which could further exacerbate the risks described above. The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that with respect to a distressed disposal of, or an enforcement of the security interests over, the Collateral, holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such Collateral only after the obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations, certain cash management obligations and certain other future indebtedness permitted under the Indenture have been repaid in full. Additionally, we could raise additional debt that could be secured or could mature prior to the Notes.

See “Description of the _Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance_ our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. In addition, the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will require us to comply with certain financial tests under certain circumstances. Our ability to meet the applicable financial test can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet it. A breach of this test could result in an event of default under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently anticipated revenue growth, cost savings and operating improvements will be realized or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs, including the repayment at maturity of the then outstanding amounts under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (if any), which will mature six months prior to the maturity of the Notes. See “Management’s Discussion and _Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”_ The commitments in respect of the New Revolving Credit Facility can be further increased, assuming we have the ability to incur such additional debt under the restrictive covenants to be included in the Indenture.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditure; - sell assets; - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or ##### 59 ----- - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes and the New Revolving Credit Facility, on or before maturity.

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our debt. In the absence of adequate operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The terms of our debt, including under the Indenture, restrict or will restrict our ability to transfer or sell assets. We may not be able to consummate certain dispositions or obtain the funds that we could have realized from the proceeds of such dispositions, and any proceeds we do realize from asset dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due. Any failure to make payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes, on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Notes, the Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement may limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, impacting our financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that any assets that we could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable.

As a result, the Issuer depends upon the receipt of sufficient funds from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations. APCOA intends to provide funds to the Issuer in order to meet the obligations on the Notes through a combination of dividends and interest payments on intercompany loans. If our subsidiaries do not fulfill their obligations under the intercompany loans and do not distribute cash to the Issuer to make scheduled payments on the Notes, the Issuer will not have any other source of funds that would allow it to make payments to the holders of the Notes. Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may actually prohibit, the ability of these subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation. Applicable law may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. In particular, the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuer will generally be limited to the amount of distributable reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay their respective debts when due, or the amount of intercompany loans available for repayment. Certain subsidiaries of the Issuer are organized under German law which provides that dividends may only be distributed out of current profits and distributable reserves, and, generally, interim dividend contributions are not allowed under German law. Under German corporate law, a company may only pay dividends if it has unappropriated retained earnings in its unconsolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch - “HGB”). Certain reserves must be established by law and have to be deducted when calculating the distributable profit. In addition, those subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with respect to any of the Notes. ##### 60 ----- The inability to transfer cash among entities within their respective consolidated groups may mean that, even though the entities, in aggregate, may have sufficient resources to meet such group’s obligations, they may not be permitted to make the necessary transfers from one entity in their restricted group to another entity in their restricted group in order to make payments to the entity owing the obligations.",,,,N/A

These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. Neither the Indenture nor the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt. Although we may enter into certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will be available or continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms.

In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on March 5, 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced the future cessation or loss of representativeness of the LIBOR benchmark rates (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021, in respect of some currencies and tenors, and after certain later dates for other currencies and tenors. This proposed elimination of the LIBOR benchmark and possible future announcements in respect of any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, including the need to adopt a replacement benchmark, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the Floating Rate Notes and drawing under the New Revolving Credit Facility). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, ##### 61 ----- which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest, including the Floating Rate Notes and drawings under the New Revolving Credit Facility. Furthermore, the Indenture will provide a mechanism whereby, if EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered, the Issuer could cause an independent financial advisor to determine an appropriate rate, which means interest on the Floating Rate Notes would be determined on the basis of a benchmark rate not contemplated at the time you purchased the Floating Rate Notes issued on the Issue Date. In addition, the development of alternatives to EURIBOR or LIBOR may result in our floating rate debt (including our New Revolving Credit Facility and the Floating Rate Notes) performing differently than would otherwise have been the case if the alternatives to EURIBOR or LIBOR had not developed. The Indenture may require the exercise of discretion by the Issuer and the making of potentially subjective judgments (including as to whether EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered and as to whether any alternative rate has replaced EURIBOR in customary market usage for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities) which may trigger amendments to the Indenture without the consent of the holders of the Notes. The interests of the Issuer in making such determinations or amendments may be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes. In addition, due to the uncertainty concerning the availability of an appropriate successor rate and the involvement of an independent financial institution, the Indenture’s successor rate mechanism may not operate as intended at the relevant time. If EURIBOR were discontinued or otherwise unavailable, the rate of interest on our floating rate debt (including debt instruments under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Floating Rate Notes) will be determined for the relevant period by the fallback provisions applicable to such debt.",,,,N/A

In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we will be permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may be secured by the same Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Notes and, in certain circumstances, receive proceeds from enforcement of Collateral prior to the Notes. The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will permit currency and interest rate hedging, certain cash management obligations and certain other indebtedness incurred in accordance with the Indenture to be secured on a priority basis. ##### 62 ----- In the event of enforcement of the Collateral securing the Notes, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, any credit facilities that refinance or replace the New Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations, certain cash management obligations and any other indebtedness permitted to be incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture will be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in priority to the Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral, holders of the Notes may not be able to recover on the Collateral if the then outstanding claims under Super Senior Liabilities (as defined in “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”) are greater than the proceeds realized. Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral will, after all obligations under Super Senior Liabilities have been discharged from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Notes and any other obligations secured by the Collateral that are permitted to rank pari passu and are secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes. As a result, proceeds from the sale of Collateral in connection with any enforcement action may be insufficient to pay claims under the Notes. In addition, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common security agent, who will serve as the Security Agent for the secured parties with respect to the Collateral, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Collateral unless otherwise instructed by the Instructing Group (as defined in “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements— _Intercreditor Agreement”) for the purpose of enforcement. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security.”_ Creditors of Super Senior Liabilities may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells the Collateral as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Notes and the Note Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such entities securing such Notes and Note Guarantees may be released.

We may increase the amounts available under the New Revolving Credit Facility or incur additional Super Senior Liabilities permitted under the Indenture, as a result of which the amount that will benefit from “super priority” first-priority security interests in the Collateral may be increased up to the amount permitted under the Indenture. The Collateral may also secure additional debt ranking pari passu with the Notes to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders of the Notes to the Collateral may therefore be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by first-priority liens on the Collateral. If there is an event of default on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only by the Collateral. There is no guarantee that the value of the Collateral will be sufficient to enable the Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with respect to the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due on the Notes. No appraisal of the fair market value of the Collateral has been made in connection with the Transactions. The fair market value of the Collateral is based on certain assumptions and may be subject ##### 63 ----- to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, general economic conditions, industry conditions and similar factors. The amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers, whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral and the fair market value and condition of the Collateral. Furthermore, there may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy a significant portion of our assets in the event of an enforcement action. As a result, the book value of the Collateral should not be conclusively relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets following the occurrence of an event of default or enforcement event under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture or the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in our liquidation. In addition, the value of the Collateral may fluctuate over time and the security granted over the shares of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. To the extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned by the Issuer or the Guarantors, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent, the Trustee or investors as holders of the Notes to realize or enforce that Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and the Note Guarantees, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s and (if the relevant guarantee has not been released) the Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the intercreditor arrangement governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral.",,,,N/A
57,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.26,Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital Structure,1.26.11,It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes.,"The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by other creditors that have the benefit of security interests in the Collateral from time to time. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first priority ranking of security interests with respect to the Notes can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in the Collateral. For example, the enforcement of share pledges, whether by means of a public auction or a private sale, may be subject to certain specific requirements and the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third-party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

The granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods in particular, because the Indenture will permit the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected or recreated. Each time, if the security interest granted, perfected or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. If the grantor of such security interest were to become subject to a bankruptcy or windingup proceeding after the Issue Date, any mortgage or security interest in the Collateral delivered after the Issue Date would face a greater risk than security interests in place on the Issue Date of being voided by the grantor or by its trustee, receiver, liquidator, administrator or similar authority, or otherwise set aside by a court, as a preference under insolvency law. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the security interest. See “Certain _Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.”_ The same rights and risks also will apply with respect to future security interests granted in connection with the accession of further subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interests over their relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes.",,,,N/A

The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. In addition, the Agreed Security Principles allow the Issuer and the Guarantor to retain control over, operate and collect, invert and dispose of any income from the Collateral securing the Notes which with respect to Collateral located in certain jurisdictions, including Denmark, entail that such Collateral will not be considered perfected. In addition, applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property, equipment subject to a certificate and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at or promptly following the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing such holder’s rights in the Collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral and some security interests do not actually create the purported security interest if not properly perfected. In addition, a debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the security provider until, but not after, the debtor receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by the security provider in favor of the security taken over the claims the security taker (as creditor) has against the debtor. Finally, since the ranking of pledges is sometimes determined by the date on which they became enforceable against third parties, a security interest created on a later date over the same Collateral, but which came into force for third parties earlier (by way of registration in the appropriate register, by notification or under the general terms and conditions of banks and financial institutions) may have priority. Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent has any obligation or responsibility to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or the perfection of, or to take steps or actions to perfect or ensure the perfection of, any security interest in the Notes against third parties. The failure to create or perfect such additional security interests may adversely affect the relevant security interest and/or the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes.

Such a release and retaking of Collateral may give rise to the start of a new “hardening period” in respect of such Collateral. Under certain circumstances, other creditors, insolvency administrators or representatives or courts could challenge the validity and enforceability of the grant of such Collateral. Any such challenge, if successful, could potentially limit your recovery in respect of such Collateral and thus reduce your recovery under the Notes. ##### 66 ----- Furthermore, under German law a secured party is, upon request by the relevant security grantor, obligated to release security if the realizable value of the security is significantly higher than the value of the obligations secured by such security.

In addition, as of March 31, 2021, our subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes had €1.5 million of outstanding third-party debt that would have ranked structurally senior to the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Note Guarantees. Unless a subsidiary of the Issuer is a Guarantor, such subsidiary will not have any obligations to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. The Indenture will, subject to some limitations, permit our non-Guarantor subsidiaries to incur substantial amounts of additional indebtedness and will not restrict the amount of other liabilities that may be incurred by these subsidiaries.

Any insolvency proceedings by or against the Issuer or Guarantors incorporated or organized in jurisdictions outside of the United States would likely be based on the insolvency laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the relevant entity or its “centre of main ##### 67 ----- interests” (including EU insolvency laws) and not of the United States. In the event the Issuer or any of the other Guarantors experience financial difficulty, we cannot predict as to which jurisdiction or jurisdictions may commence insolvency or similar proceedings, or the outcome of such proceedings. Any enforcement of the Note Guarantees of the Notes after bankruptcy or an insolvency event in such other jurisdictions will be subject to the insolvency laws of the relevant entity’s jurisdiction of incorporation or other jurisdictions, including the jurisdiction of its “centre of main interests.” The insolvency and other laws of each of these jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar. The insolvency and other laws of each of these jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void preferential transfer, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply and may adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Note Guarantees in these jurisdictions and limit any amounts that you may receive. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and _Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.”_ Security interests to secure the Notes and Note Guarantees will be granted in collateral located in certain of these jurisdictions. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions or in the jurisdiction of organization of a future Guarantor. Your rights under the Notes, the security granted in respect of the Notes and guarantees of the Notes will therefore be subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions, and you may not be able to enforce effectively your rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multijurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. The consequences of the multiple jurisdictions involved in the Transactions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply which could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Notes and the Note Guarantees. In addition, certain jurisdictions may impose limitations on the ability of foreign creditors to enforce security interests, including, for example, requiring registration or approval under foreign ownership regulations. The laws of certain of the jurisdictions in which the Guarantors are incorporated or organized further limit the ability of these subsidiaries to guarantee debt of, or provide security for, other companies.

However, the Indenture will provide that each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant Note Guarantee, as it relates to that Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law, and enforcement of each Note Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses. In addition, the Indenture will provide for further limitations in accordance with the specific legal requirements in each Guarantor jurisdiction. For example, the Note Guarantees and security interests to be granted by each Italian Guarantor will only guarantee and secure the Issuer’s obligations under Tranche B (as defined herein) of the Notes. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and _Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.” The same_ limitations may apply to security interests (other than the Note Guarantees) that will be provided by the Guarantors in certain jurisdictions. ##### 68 ----- Enforcement of any of the Note Guarantees or security against any Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses and limitations available to Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. These laws and defenses generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, the preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws, defenses and limitations are applicable, a Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its Note Guarantee or other security depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of any Note Guarantee against any Guarantor. Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a court could (i) void or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Note Guarantee, direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Note Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (ii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found, among other things, that: - the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest in the Collateral was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another, to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor; or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the Note Guarantees has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest; - the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for the relevant Note Guarantee and the Guarantor: (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest; (ii) was undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Note Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; - the relevant Note Guarantee and/or Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor; - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Note Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law; or - the grant of the Note Guarantee or security is, having regard to the risk accepted by the holders of the Notes, on terms which are, or were, such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether conditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the subscription for the Notes or otherwise grossly contravenes ordinary principles of fair dealing. These or similar laws may also apply to any future Note Guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture or other securities pursuant to the Security Documents. We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Note Guarantee was issued, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds. The measure of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than the fair value of all its assets; the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become due; or it cannot pay its debts as they become due. ##### 69 ----- The liability of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee or other security will be limited to the amount that will result in such Note Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution, or otherwise being set aside or found to be in violation of the applicable statutory requirements in each such jurisdiction. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor, or the effectiveness of limitation language. It is possible that the entire Note Guarantee or other security may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. If a court decided that a Note Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and voided such Note Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Note Guarantee that has not been declared void.

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase. If a Change of Control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other then-existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A Change of Control may trigger a mandatory prepayment of amounts outstanding under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and other indebtedness even if such event is deemed not to be a change of control under the Indenture. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control, may be limited by our thenexisting financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a Change of Control were to occur at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer would remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the New Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.” The Change of Control provision that will be contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a Change of Control as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of _the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer_ to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. ##### 70 ----- Moreover, as a matter of German law, with regard to any Change of Control triggered by measures taken in respect of the Issuer for the purpose of a debt/equity-swap as part of an insolvency plan proceeding (Insolvenzplanverfahren) or a restructuring plan proceeding (Restrukturierungsplanverfahren) under German law, the Change of Control provision could be deemed void and we would not be required to offer the repurchase of the outstanding Notes. In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a Change of Control will be deemed not to be a Change of Control if a certain net consolidated leverage ratio calculated in accordance with the “Description of the Notes” is not exceeded in connection with such an event. In this case, holders of Notes would not be entitled to require the Issuer to repurchase their Notes and would only be able to rely on the then prevailing trading prices in order to exit their investments, which might be lower than the 101% change of control repurchase price. See “Description of the Notes— _Change of Control” and “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions—Change of Control Triggering Event.”_ The definition of Change of Control in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (if any), taken as a whole, to certain persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the relevant Notes.",,,,N/A

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment-grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there can be no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all. Although an application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be or remain listed. Although no assurance can be made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the admission to the Official List of the Exchange, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of the Notes from the Official List of the Exchange may have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes in the secondary market.

Moreover, we may elect to, but are not under any obligation to, revoke or otherwise reverse an IPO Debt Pushdown undertaken in anticipation of an initial public offering, or to replace any Note Guarantees or Collateral released pursuant thereto, in the event such initial public offering is not consummated. To the extent that new security documents in respect of any Collateral to be retaken (including a pledge over the shares of the Issuer) are entered into, such Collateral may be subject to new hardening periods.

If such modifications result in a deemed exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such deemed exchange generally would be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which beneficial owners of the Notes would be required to recognize any gain or loss. Furthermore, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the new Notes deemed issued in such a deemed exchange could be treated as issued with original issue discount.

57,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.33,Overview,1.33.1,,"We are a leading parking infrastructure operator and services provider in the European market, with a large and diversified portfolio of leased and managed parking facilities across 13 European countries. We operate off-street parking facilities under leases from private and public landlords, and also operate on- and off-street parking facilities for clients under management contracts. As of March 31, 2021, we operated approximately 11,700 parking facilities with over 1.6 million parking spaces. We believe we are either the leading or number two parking facility operator by number of parking spaces in each of our ten largest country markets. We benefit from a large, structurally attractive and growing parking market that we believe will benefit from ongoing outsourcing, mobility and other industry trends such as growth in the number of vehicles in Europe, urban areas, electric vehicle (“EV”) charging, car hiring and sharing and more recently use of the car parks as infrastructure for the e-commerce value chain and customer delivery. During 2018, the European parking market generated approximately €28 to 29 billion in revenues of which approximately €11 to 12 billion was spent on outsourcing parking management. We believe we are well positioned to capture the benefits from these trends and the general economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic expected in 2021 and 2022 because we create significant, stable and recurring value for our clients, for whom parking facilities are often a non-core operation, by providing a large scale platform that is focused on driving higher revenues by increasing volume, pricing and utilization, at a lower cost of operation. ##### 78 ----- Our operations benefit from a diverse portfolio of lease and management contracts as well as geographical, business sector and customer diversification, which made our business more resilient during the COVID-19 pandemic, while at the same time allowing us to leverage operational similarities to benefit from scale economies. Our parking facilities are spread across most of Europe (with certain clusters for operational efficiency) and apart from one large market (Germany), five other countries (Denmark, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Norway) each contributed approximately 10% of our Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution in the year ended December 31, 2019. We operate in a wide range of business sectors, such as city and shopping, travel, healthcare & education, events and hospitality, and parking enforcement, with limited correlation between them. Furthermore, many of our parking facilities are not dedicated to a single institution, business or purpose but are instead multifunctional and used by motorists that visit a variety of locations, whether it is for work, shopping, restaurant or cultural activities, or other purposes. We have very low contract concentration, with over 5,900 contracts across over 11,700 parking facilities. We are a leading parking infrastructure operator and services provider in the European market, with a large and diversified portfolio of leased and managed parking facilities across 13 European countries. We operate off-street parking facilities under leases from private and public landlords, and also operate on- and off-street parking facilities for clients under management contracts. As of March 31, 2021, we operated approximately 11,700 parking facilities with over 1.6 million parking spaces. We believe we are either the leading or number two parking facility operator by number of parking spaces in each of our ten largest country markets. We benefit from a large, structurally attractive and growing parking market that we believe will benefit from ongoing outsourcing, mobility and other industry trends such as growth in the number of vehicles in Europe, urban areas, electric vehicle (“EV”) charging, car hiring and sharing and more recently use of the car parks as infrastructure for the e-commerce value chain and customer delivery. During 2018, the European parking market generated approximately €28 to 29 billion in revenues of which approximately €11 to 12 billion was spent on outsourcing parking management. We believe we are well positioned to capture the benefits from these trends and the general economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic expected in 2021 and 2022 because we create significant, stable and recurring value for our clients, for whom parking facilities are often a non-core operation, by providing a large scale platform that is focused on driving higher revenues by increasing volume, pricing and utilization, at a lower cost of operation.

Within the City & Shopping sector, our operations include a mixture of lease contracts and management contracts with clients including municipalities, investors and owners and operators of city centre parking facilities which are generally visited by consumers for a variety of purposes such as offices, other places of work, leisure and recreational locations. Short-term parking, including for work, shopping, cultural activities or other purposes, contributes the majority of revenue by fee type with approximately 65% on average. Our operations in this sector benefit from ongoing urbanization across Europe as well as the continuing increase in population mobility, which have historically led to increased vehicle numbers within urban environments. Our growth in this sector is partially offset by the expanding use of public transportation as well as the growing popularity of e-commerce, all of which reduces footfall in inner cities. In addition, we also operate a number of facilities related to either in-town or out-of-town shopping centers under a mixture of both lease and management contracts. Growth in this sector is generally through a combination of pricing and through utilizing technology to reduce the costs of operating these facilities (e.g., through the introduction of ANPR technology). ##### 79 ----- Our results of operations in the City & Shopping sector were significantly affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the implementation of nationwide lockdowns, increased home working and the closure of non-essential shops across Europe. Given the quick and almost instant recovery of the City & Shopping sector upon lifting of lockdown measures during 2020, we expect our operation in this sector to gradually return to the levels seen before the pandemic as the vaccine roll-out accelerates and restrictions on social contact are eased across Europe and, particularly in the initial periods of the recovery, where we expect some consumers switch to using private rather than public transport. _Travel_ The Travel sector is our second-largest sector in terms of revenue. Our operations in the Travel sector include a mixture of lease contracts and management contracts. In the latter, we receive management fees independently of parking volumes at the underlying parking facility, across a number of segments of the travel market including airports, train stations and park & ride facilities. Our financial performance in this sector has historically been partly driven by positive passenger volume trends in European air travel, which increased by 30% between 2014 and 2019, as well as by increasing disposable income, which has resulted in an increase in holiday travel. While our performance in the Travel sector in the three months ended March 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020, was significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a year-on-year decrease in air passenger numbers across the European Union by 70%, passenger volumes are forecast to recover to their preCOVID-19 pandemic levels by 2024. Despite the volume impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our Contract Contribution decreased only by 39% in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 due to a combination of our mix of contract types and operations across different segments of the Travel sector as well as support from our clients. A number of our clients in this sector waived any guaranteed minimum rents in our airport lease contracts (thereby making them fully variable rents and thus providing downside protection in the face of reduced travel volumes throughout the pandemic) and, in a number of locations, our landlords agreed to temporarily reduce the variable rent percentages. _Healthcare & Education_ Our operations in the Healthcare & Education sector have historically benefitted from the ongoing outsourcing of parking management and parking enforcement services by public and private hospital operators and universities. Our clients in the Healthcare & Education sector include public and private hospitals as well as universities. Many clients in this sector consider parking to be important as both a service to offer their visitors in addition to a revenue generator for them. As such, we operate a mixture of both lease and management contracts, depending on the client’s requirements and our view of the risk profile of a contract. The healthcare sites are usually characterized by limited available spaces with different publics to be served: staff, patients and visitors. The efficient management of these customers flows increasingly requires digital technology. Similarly, in the Education sector there is a mix of teaching and other staff, students and visitors, again with limited spaces that require careful management. Particularly in the Healthcare sector we increasingly help the hospitals to expand parking capacity by planning and coordinating the building of new facilities which we then manage through contracts with a duration of over 15 years. The Healthcare & Education sector were comparatively less impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as hospitals and other healthcare facilities remained opened throughout the year and continued to benefit from high utilization of parking facilities by, for example, hospital staff. _Events and Hospitality_ The Events & Hospitality sector primarily encompasses parking facilities at exhibitions, events (including sports and cultural venues) and hotels, with both lease and management contracts. Our lease revenue in particular in this sector will be dependent on the number of events held at these locations or the number of visitors. Since parking revenues in this sector are highly dependent on the number of ##### 80 ----- events held or visitors to these locations, our contract and rent structures reflect the characteristics of each location. We usually provide the following services: site-specific ad hoc resources, organize the car flow, provide the parking equipment and focus on driving revenue which is increasingly pre-booked. In the three months ended March 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020, our performance in the Events and Hospitality sector was significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to the cancellation of mass events and the temporary closure of trade fairs and entertainment venues and significantly reduced occupancy at hotels. _Parking Enforcement Services_ Parking enforcement services sales revenue comprises control fees and revenue generated from enforcement of parking on behalf of the owner or landlord of the parking facilities. This is generally generated by our parking attendants issuing the control fees to owners of vehicles who have parked in contravention of the parking regulations at the site, or through the use of technology such as ANPR cameras.

All countries are internally measured by their ability to win new business, retain existing contracts, site price and utilization optimization and deliver continuous improvements on cost optimization. The level of revenue generation and Contract Contribution from any given country also depends on the sector split in the relevant country as well as the split between revenue types and the mix of lease and management contracts. _Germany_ Germany is our largest market and has a comparatively larger share of lease contracts compared to our other markets. Growth in this market is primarily driven by increased outsourcing of parking management (i.e. first time letting of lease or management contracts) and parking enforcement services, in addition to overall macro drivers around the mobility sector. In addition, we believe that the relatively low digital penetration of the parking industry in Germany provides us with considerable growth potential as our electronic payment and consumer engagement solutions gain increased usage. ##### 81 ----- The following charts provide overview of revenue by sector and contract type from our operations in Germany for the year ended December 31, 2019:",,,,N/A

The Travel sector (primarily covering airports and rail segments) is our largest sector in the United Kingdom, which accounted for 38% of revenue in the year ended December 31, 2019. Our operations in the United Kingdom benefit from a high share of management contracts, accounting for 81% of our total revenue in the United Kingdom in the year ended December 31, 2019, which has historically led to stable and predictable Contract Contribution generation. In addition, our operations in the United Kingdom benefit from an increased roll-out of digital parking technology, which provides us with the opportunity to access new, high-margin income streams (such as ANPR technology, which has lower associated operating costs than traditional manned patrols or barrier operations).

In addition, the Italian market for parking management services and parking enforcement services is highly fragmented, which provides us with attractive consolidation opportunities.

Travel is the largest sector by revenue in Norway, and we operate the parking facilities at most of the public and privately owned airports in the country, currently with the exception of Oslo airport.

57,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.45,COVID-19 Impact on Our Business,1.45.1,,"Our results of operation in the three months ended March 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020 have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, total revenue declined across all fee types by a total of 26.2%. However, the decline was mainly driven by a reduction of short-term parking revenue (53% of total revenue 2019) by 42.0%, while revenue from all other fee types in aggregate decreased by only 8.2%. See “—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Fee Type.” Following an approximately 16.1% increase in revenue and an 11.1% increase in Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA in the two months ended February 28, 2020 compared to the prior-year period, revenue generation and Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA declined sharply, by approximately 44% and 173%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2020 as a result of the strict lockdown measures imposed by governments across Europe to slow the spread of COVID-19. The imposition of lockdown measures had most severe impact on our operations during the period from March to May 2020, when short-term parking revenues were significantly reduced, as consumers worked from home and were only allowed or advised to go out for essential or narrowly-defined permitted purposes. With the easing of lockdown measures across our jurisdictions of operation towards the end of the second quarter of 2020, consumers almost instantly started to utilize our parking facilities again, which resulted in a strong recovery of our short-term parking revenues and operating cash flows, which continued through the end of the summer of 2020. Even with short-term parking revenue in the third quarter of 2020 continuing to be negatively affected by the absence of mass events, the closure of hospitality and entertainment venues, nationwide working from home policies and continued restrictions on travel, we estimate that across all of our jurisdictions of operations our revenue for the third quarter ended September 30, 2020 reached approximately 76% of our revenue generated during the third quarter ended September 30, 2019. The resurgence of the virus in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the corresponding imposition of further lockdown measures led to a renewed significant decrease in short-term parking revenues. At the same time, our contract parking revenue increased by 5.5% in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, our management contracts remained relatively less impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with our revenue from management contracts for the year ended December 31, 2020 amounting to €155.6 million compared to €173.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Our management reacted quickly to the COVID-19 pandemic and established a cross-functional COVID-19 response team, which focuses on safeguarding the health and safety of our employees and consumers and limiting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. In particular, in March 2020, management implemented strict cash management controls, including (i) a bottom-up, 17-week rolling cashflow forecast and (ii) the deferral of non-essential capital expenditures, which resulted in a reduction of our non-new business capital expenditures to €17.7 million (compared to €22.5 million in the year ended December 2019). These cash management controls resulted in reductions in total capital expenditures (excluding finance leases) in 2020 compared to the original budget for that year of €10.3 million, of which €9.9 million was deferred to 2021. In addition, we implemented stringent operational and overhead cost reduction measures, including an immediate freeze on all temporary and new hiring, a reduction in headcount of 736 employees, particularly in our parking attendant and airport staff numbers, and furloughing approximately 20% of our non-directly revenue generating operational and overhead staff. Furthermore, we leveraged government programs, such as flexi-time and furlough arrangements and fixed cost recovery support schemes, in order to further reduce our cost base. These measures resulted in cost reductions compared to the original 2020 budget of approximately €44 million, or 17% of our total non-rent costs, in the period March 1 to December 31, 2020. ##### 85 ----- In March 2020, we initiated a rent waiver and deferral program across our entire business, which included the re-negotiation of lease contracts with the aim to defer rent payments and temporarily reduce or move fixed rent structures to variable rent structures. In addition, we invoked existing contractual protection clauses, such as clauses allowing rent adjustments in the case of an under-utilization of parking facilities, to further reduce our rent payments. These rent reduction measures, coupled with the benefit of reduced variable rent costs due to lower revenues, resulted in rent savings of approximately €125 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the original budget for that year. In May and June 2020, we also raised additional liquidity in an aggregate amount net of costs of €68 million in the form of an additional term loan facility. Furthermore, in May 2020, our shareholders, Centerbridge and SVP Global provided us with an equity injection in the amount of €40 million. In addition to implementing measures to safeguard our business, we also continued to focus on providing consumers of our parking facilities with the best possible customer service given the circumstances, including by keeping our parking facilities open as much as possible as people were advised to avoid public transportation, decreasing physical contact points by enabling and promoting digital payment and contactless and cashless parking solutions and leveraging our online pre-booking tools. These efforts resulted in high retention rate of 98% in line with previous years and new business equivalent to €13.2 million in annualized Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution during 2020, which we expect will contribute significantly to our portfolio growth going forward. While our business has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the past fifteen months also showed that as soon as restrictions are eased, people quickly start to return to our facilities, corresponding to a direct recovery in revenues. Our liquidity position remains stable and we believe that the continued roll-out of vaccination programs across our markets will contribute to the acceleration of our recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.",,,,N/A
57,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.46,Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations,1.46.1,Demand for Parking Services,"Our revenues and profitability are affected by industry-wide megatrends which drive demand for our parking services. Growth in the European parking industry is driven by increasing urbanization across Europe, as well as an increased mobility of urban populations, with cars historically accounting for more than 80% of passenger transport in the European Union. These trends have led to a significant growth of the overall vehicle fleet in Europe, which has increased by between 12 and 15 million vehicles per year between 2013 and 2019, and stood at over 240 million vehicles at the end of 2019. While this growth trend was reversed in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, when new car registrations in Europe decreased by approximately 24%, the total number of vehicles in Europe remained relatively stable. At the same time, traffic volumes and, in turn, demand for parking services are negatively affected by increased consumer reliance on car sharing and taxi services, such as Uber, which provide alternatives to private vehicle usage. In addition, cities and municipalities are expanding their public transportation networks as they seek to control the flow of traffic through their town and city centers, which may result in reduced car traffic. Furthermore, increased regulation of the car industry, such as the phase-out of combustion engines across Europe as well as road user charges, such as London’s congestion charge and Oslo’s road tolls, can lead to a reduction in the level of traffic, as well as stagnating demand for parking spaces.",,,,N/A
57,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.46,Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations,1.46.2,Type of Contract,"We provide parking management services and parking enforcement services through a combination of lease contracts and management contracts. ##### 86 ----- _Lease Contracts_ Lease contracts are medium-term contracts with a typical initial duration of ten to fifteen years, with an option to extend for another five to ten years mostly at our sole discretion. Under our lease contracts, we are typical responsible for running the parking operations at the relevant parking facility. In turn, we receive parking fees directly from the consumer using the parking facility and pay rent to the lessor or owner of the underlying asset. Rent payments under our lease contracts are usually in a combination of fixed rent payments, which accounted for 42% of rent payments in the year ended December 31, 2019 (on a Pre-IFRS 16 basis), and variable rent payments that are linked to, for example, the amount of parking fees collected. In addition, under our lease contracts, we are typically responsible for all operating expenses of the relevant parking facility, such as personnel expenses, cost of materials and other operating expenses as well as all capital expenditure for parking equipment. We often have full pricing autonomy under our lease contracts, except at locations where the landlord wishes to retain authority for parking tariffs such as airports and shopping centers. In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, lease contracts accounted for 76%, 76%, 71% and 69%, respectively, of our total revenue . Furthermore, in the year ended December 31, 2019, lease contracts accounted for 96% of revenue in Denmark, 83% in Sweden, 97% in Norway, 84% in Italy, 84% in Germany and 19% in the United Kingdom. As of March 31, 2021, we had approximately 7,000 sites under lease agreements. _Management Contracts_ Management contracts have a typical duration of three to eight years. Under our management contracts, we receive fees from the site owner or lessor to cover our costs for running a site in addition to a fee for managing the site. We can also generate revenue from equipment sales to our clients. The management fees that we receive under our management contracts is typically adjusted on an annual basis based on the consumer price index or other benchmark indices. We do not pay rent to our customers under our management contracts but remain responsible for covering the underlying parking facility’s operating expenses, such as personnel expenses, cost of materials and other operating expenses. Parking tariff control and other strategic decisions related to the underlying parking facility remain with the owner or lessor. As a result, we are not exposed to risk of fluctuating parking volume and instead focus our activities on optimizing our operational performance. Management contracts generally have lower margins than lease contracts as we are not exposed to any revenue risk. However, our margins earned from management contracts are a function of a markup on our operational costs, rather than consumer revenue less rent less operational costs for lease contracts, and as a result on a percentage basis, management contract margins are not directly comparable to those for lease contracts. Total management contract revenue includes that shown as ‘management agreements’ in the fee type analysis, in addition to part of ‘other services’ which relates to charge-on of costs to management contract clients. In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, management contracts accounted for 24%, 24%, 29% and 31%, respectively, of our total revenue. Furthermore, in the year ended December 31, 2019, management contracts accounted for 4% of revenue in Denmark, 17% in Sweden, 3% in Norway, 16% in Italy, 16% in Germany and 81% in the United Kingdom.

Furthermore, the parking fees are impacted by regulation: regulation affects the level of supply, through controlling new developments, the pricing of on-street parking, and the amount of available free parking. Lastly, regulations affect the demand for our parking facilities through policies that discourage vehicle traffic, such as congestion charges and other urban planning measures, and the promotion of mass transit alternatives. We continue to optimize our pricing structure through the roll-out of our data-driven dynamic pricing model, which allows us to adjust our parking tariffs based on the location of a parking facility, the time and day, demand at a particular parking facility and the duration of stay.",,,,N/A

As of March 31, 2021, we had 7,000 sites under lease contracts and 4,700 sites under management agreements and to May 31, 2021 we have signed new contracts accounting for €6.4 million of total Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution. The amount of new contracts signed per year has continued to increase in recent years, from €12.2 million in 2018, to €12.4 million in 2019 and €13.2 million in 2020, in each case, of total Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution. We have historically retained contracts accounting for more than 95% of our Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution in the past five years, which we believe is a result of our disciplined and proactive approach to contract renewals for facilities that we consider desirable or less risky to our overall business operations. In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, we renewed contracts accounting for €8.6 million, €11.3 million and €22.7 million of total Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution, respectively. Our win rate has also increased, from approximately 35% in 2016 to 60% in 2019 and 75% in 2020. As a result of the successful renewal of these contracts, the volume of contracts that is due for renewal by the end of 2026 is significantly lower and only accounts for an aggregate €44.8 million of Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution for the year ended December 31, 2019 representing on average only 5% per annum across that period of our total Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of March 31, 2021, the remaining average duration of our top 100 lease contracts was 14 years and of our top 100 management contracts was approximately six years, in both cases based on 2019 Pre-IFRS 16 weighted average Contract Contribution. We believe that our high client retention rate, coupled with lower volumes of contract renewals in the period through to 2026, have historically contributed, and will continue to contribute, to the stability of our revenue generation and earnings visibility. Despite the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, in the year ended December 31, 2020 and the three months ended March 31, 2021 we signed new contracts which we estimate will contribute an aggregate amount of approximately €53.6 million to our revenue and approximately €13.2 million to our Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution and approximately €14.8 million to our revenue and approximately €3.6 million to our Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution, respectively. On average, the Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution margin of new business won during 2020 is approximately 500bps above the existing core portfolio of contracts. Our unweighted pipeline of new contracts has constantly remained high, amounting to approximately €66 million, €67 million, €78 million and €80 million of Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, respectively. Prior to entering into a new contract for a parking facility, we assess the optimum level of investment for that facility in order to increase its profitability and produce a suitable return on our investment. Our level of investment will in turn depend on whether or not we believe that the facility in question would benefit from extensive investment in the redesign and addition of APCOA-specific features, such as APCOA FLOW and ANPR technology, which would be typical for attractive locations with expected high demand for high quality parking, such as in the City & Shopping sector. We typically agree a lower level of investment in facilities where cash flows are less certain and/or there is a limited opportunity to realize financial benefits from our branding and design. We typically recoup or initial investment after one to two years in the case of lease contracts and less than one year in the case of management contracts. Contract Contribution recognized in the year from new contracts increased from €8 million in 2016 to €13 million in 2019.",,,,N/A

Our cost structure mainly comprises fixed costs, such as fixed rent payments, overhead personnel costs and costs associated with our parking facilities, such as costs for maintenance and repairs and ancillary costs, which accounted for approximately 40% of our costs in the year ended December 31, 2019 (on a Pre-IFRS 16 basis), as well as semi-variable costs, such as operational staff, cleaning costs, costs related to snow removal, travel and equipment repairs, which accounted for approximately 30% of our cost base in the year ended December 31, 2019 (on a Pre-IFRS 16 basis). In addition, in the year ended December 31, 2019, ##### 90 ----- approximately 30% of our costs were variable (on a Pre-IFRS 16 basis), mainly consisting of variable rents and payment card processing fees. _Rent_ Lease expenses, or rent, comprises fixed lease payments as well as performance-based variable lease payments, which are generally calculated on a percentage of the sales revenue generated from the underlying leased site. In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, 57%, 58% and 46%, respectively, of our pre-IFRS 16 rent expenses were variable. The fixed rent component under our lease contracts is periodically adjusted based on the consumer price index or other benchmark indices. Our total rent expenses amounted to €356.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 (of which €126.1 million was fixed and €230.6 million was variable), €321.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 (of which €129.0 million was fixed and €192.5 million was variable), €318.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 (of which €136.8 million was fixed and €181.8 million was variable), €344.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 (of which €144.0 million was fixed and €200.6 million was variable) and €262.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 (of which €141.1 million was fixed and €121.1 million was variable), in each case, before giving effect to the application of IFRS 16. Excluding the effects of IFRS 16, our comparatively low rent expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflect a decrease in variable rents as a result of reduced revenue from lease contracts due to the COVID-19 pandemic during that year. In addition, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we received government grants on a country-by-country basis to offset fixed costs (including fixed lease payments, office rent, other operational expenditures and other overhead expenses). _Personnel Expenses_ Our personnel expenses constitute the second largest part of our cost structure after lease expenses. Personnel expenses are largely fixed and semi-variable and include wages and salaries as well as social security payments. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we benefitted from a number of government aid programs set up in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the jurisdictions in which we operate our business. Pursuant to these programs, we received government grants in an aggregate amount of €8.4 million, which were recognized as a reduction in personnel expenses in our 2020 Audited Financial Statements. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we took advantage of employment support programs, such as Kurzarbeit in Germany, Cassa Integrazione in Italy, temporary unemployment in Belgium and the furlough scheme in the United Kingdom. _Cost of Materials and Purchased Services_ Our cost of materials are largely variable or semi-variable in nature and include (i) maintenance repair costs and expenses for the repair of technical equipment, (ii) expenses for other external services, such as payments in connection with external parking space monitoring and expenses for payment cards and cleaning services, (iii) expenses for energy and other utilities and (iv) the costs of general operating supplies, such as Pay & Display machines. _Other Expenses_ Other operating expenses are mainly fixed in nature and include audit and consulting costs, information technology expenses, expenses for temporary workers, expenses related to our fleet, travel expenses and expenses for telecommunications. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we significantly reduced our other operating expenses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, by terminating and furloughing temporary employees (resulting in a €2.5 million reduction in other operating expenses), cancelling nearly all business travel (resulting in a €2.2 million reduction in other operating expenses), streamlining our vehicle fleet (resulting in a €1.2 million reduction in other operating expenses) and severely limiting our marketing expenses (resulting in a €0.9 million reduction in other operating expenses). ##### 91 -----",,,,N/A

In order to increase the productivity in our control fee revenue stream, we optimized the deployment and routing of parking attendants based on site occupancy, traffic congestion and historical hit rates. We also minimized unproductive hours by starting the routes directly on site, reduced sickness rates and used means of transportation reflecting the local traffic situation. To optimize site costs across our business, we implemented group-wide benchmarks and best practices, resulting in a streamlined FTE headcount and pooled resources to minimize overcapacity. We also adjusted third-party services and reduced utilities costs. To streamline our central and procurement costs, we implemented pooled customer service functions cross-country, we digitized back-office processes and implemented self-administrative contract parker platforms. In addition, we took steps to bundle our procurement activities across our entire business to leverage our scale and generate cross-country synergies. We estimate that these measures have resulted in total cost savings of approximately €10 million across 2017-2019, in addition to the various measures and savings introduced in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which are discussed elsewhere in this document.",,,,N/A

To grow our business, we increasingly rely on digital marketing, including a robust social media presence, which continues to be a key driver of parking volumes. In addition, we are increasing the use of our online sales and pre-booking platforms, which allow consumer to pre-book parking spaces and purchase season tickets online. Between 2015 and 2019, the number of online prebooking services more than tripled. Furthermore, we believe that the increasing digitization of the parking industry allows for new partnerships with participants across the broader automotive landscape, such as fleet lessors, fuel card managers and parking services providers, which drive volumes at existing sites and which we expect will provide for additional revenue streams, such as subscription fees for partners’ services offered through our websites, in the future. To respond to the increased demand for digital parking services, we launched our apps “APCOA Connect” in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland in 2012 as well as “APCOA FLOW” in Denmark, Germany, Italy, Norway, Austria, Poland and Sweden from 2018, which enables consumers to access mobile, contactless on- and offstreet parking services. We estimate that we generated revenues of approximately €35 million through these apps in the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, the digitization of the parking industry has allowed us to generate revenues from new parking and services concepts, such as storage opportunities for logistics providers, virtual car rental services and electronic vehicle charging, which we continue to roll out across our business through our Urban Hubs initiative.",,,,N/A

Revenue for leased sites is comprised of a mix of short-term parking fees, contract parking fees and control fees, although we do not always generate all types of fees from every site. For leased sites, our revenue is generally related to the volume of consumers using these sites. In addition, we are usually also responsible for collecting the consumer revenue at leased sites. To minimize our revenue collection risk, we collect most of the short-term parking and contract parking fees at our leased sites either in advance or at the point of utilization of the parking site. Revenue for management sites is comprised of management fees, which are intended to cover both our costs incurred in operating a site for a client and our fees for performing the management services. Management fees are either fixed in total, which allows us to increase site profitability through cost savings, or on an actual cost recovery basis, which results in cost saving programs benefitting the client, plus a fixed management element. In addition to our traditional fee types, we are seeing increasing demand for utilization of our parking facilities as Urban Hubs. We consider income from our Urban Hubs to be incremental to income generated from parking consumers as our Urban Hubs typically either utilize spare capacity at sites or at times of the day when occupancy levels are generally lower, resulting in only limited overlap with our other revenue streams. We plan to separately report revenue from our Urban Hubs once it becomes material to the overall group. ##### 88 ----- _Short-Term Parking Fees_ Short-term parking fees are generated from shorter term parking customers, such as per-hour or per-day tickets, under our lease contracts. We collect short-term parking fees directly from the short-term parking customers in the form of cash or by debit or credit cards at the gates and physical barriers present in our parking facilities. Short-term parking is typically charged at higher rates than long-term parking, resulting in higher profitability per hour as compared to long-term parking. At the same time, short-term parking exposes us to risks of lower level of parking facility utilization and, as a result, greater volatility in revenue generation. _Management Fees_ Management fees comprise fixed and variable fees generated under our management contracts with third parties, including public authorities and private landlords and can be across all the main sectors in which we operate. The level of management fees for a particular asset is typically agreed for the duration of the management contract and is typically adjusted on an annual basis based on the consumer price index as well as other benchmark indices, such as the London Living Wage. Given their relatively fixed nature, management fees provide us with revenue stability and visibility over the duration of the management contract. _Contract Parking Fees_ Contract parking fees describe fees generated from customers holding season tickets, including monthly, quarterly and annual season tickets, under our lease contracts. Contract parking fees are fixed for the duration of the agreement with the consumer and are typically subject to annual price escalations and collected in advance of the period to which they relate. As a result, contract parking fees have historically provided us with greater revenue stability compared to short-term parking fees. _Parking Enforcement Services Fees_ The type of fees received under our parking enforcement services vary depending on whether our contract is with private landlords (in the case of Parking Control (“PAC”) or Park & Guard services) or with municipalities (in the case of “On-Street” services). Under contracts with private landlords, we generate control fees which comprise revenue generated from enforcement of parking on behalf of the owner or landlord of the parking facilities. Under these contracts, we patrol privately-owned parking spaces and issue and collect parking control fees directly from the consumer. We subsequently may pay a portion of the fees collected to the site landlord under our lease agreements based on the level of fees collected. In the case of “On-Street” services, we patrol parking spaces owned by public authorities and issue parking fines, which the consumer pays directly to the municipality. Under such contracts, we receive a management fee from the municipality for the provision of our enforcement services. These fees are reported under the ‘management agreement’ fee type. We do not book any of the control fees and fines as part of our revenue. _Other Services_ Our revenue from other services mainly includes charge-on of certain costs to management contract clients, fees charged to owners and landlords for services provided to them in connection with our contacts, such as revenue generated from the sale of parking equipment, income generated from advertising activities and valet parking services. ##### 89 -----",,,,N/A

Revenue in all of our geographies decreased in the three months ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to reductions in frequencies and volumes caused by movement restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Germany this decrease was partly offset by the impact of the new contract at Berlin Brandenburg airport (€3.4 million) which commenced operations in the fourth quarter of 2020. In Norway, the decrease was partially offset by revenue generated from the Security Park Group (€1.6 million), which we acquired in December 2020.

This decrease was primarily due to lower variable rent payments as a result of decreased revenues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On a Pre-IFRS 16 basis, our variable rent for the three months ended March 31, 2021 would have been €27.3 million compared to €42.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily as a result of decreased revenues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On a PreIFRS 16 basis, our fixed rent for the three months ended March 31, 2021 would have been €36.0 million compared to €37.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020.

Revenue in all of our geographies decreased in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to reductions in frequencies and volumes caused by movement restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Germany, this decrease was partially offset by the impact of the new contract at Berlin Brandenburg airport which commenced operations in the fourth quarter of 2020. In Sweden, the decrease was also due to the loss of an airport taxi management contract in the fourth quarter of 2019, partly offset by the impact of the acquisition of Xpert Parkering Sweden AB in January 2020 which contributed revenue of €6.1 million in that year. In Denmark, the decrease was partly offset by the impact of the acquisition of OnePark, which we acquired in May 2019 and contributed to our revenue for a full year for the first time in 2020. In our non-key geographies, the decrease in revenues was partially offset by new business contracts in Poland and by the impact of the acquisition of NCPS in Ireland, which we acquired in August 2019 and contributed to our revenue for a full year for the first time in 2020. ##### 97 ----- Revenue by Sales Type Short term parking_ - Short-term parking revenue decreased by €161.0 million, or 42.0%, to €222.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to €383.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to reductions in frequencies and volumes caused by movement restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. _Management agreements - Management agreements revenue decreased by €3.1 million, or 2.5%, to_ €123.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to €126.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to reduced headcount and other costs required to services these contracts caused by movement restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in lower revenues as we often recharge our actual cots to service these contracts. _Contract parking - Contract parking increased by €4.5 million, or 5.5%, to €87.0 million for the year_ ended December 31, 2020 as compared to €82.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to increased consumer demand for assigned parking spaces when using their car for commuting due to the COVID-19 pandemic. _Control fees - Control fees decreased by €10.9 million, or 14.2%, to €65.9 million for the year ended_ December 31, 2020 as compared to €76.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to due to some reduction in parking violation volumes caused by movement restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. _Other services - Other services revenue decreased by €19.5 million, or 33.9%, to €38.2 million for the_ year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to €57.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower levels of charge-on of operating costs on some management contracts and fees paid by taxi businesses for utilizing our parking spaces. _Sales deduction - Sales deductions decreased by €1.2 million, or 21.1%, to sales deductions of €4.5_ million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to sales deductions of €5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to some reduction in parking violation volumes caused by movement restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. _Other Income_ Other income increased by €0.8 million, or 5.3%, to €15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to €15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due an increase in income from negative variable rent payments according to IFRS 16. _Rent_ Rent decreased by €84.7 million, or 40.8%, to €122.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to €207.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower variable rent payments as a result of decreased revenues due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

57,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.62,Liquidity and Capital Resources,1.62.2,,"Our primary liquidity requirements are to service our debt, fund our operations and for other general corporate purposes. Our ability to generate cash from our operations depends on our future operating performance, which is in turn dependent, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors including those discussed in this section and the section entitled “Risk Factors.” Following the completion of the Transactions, we expect that our principal sources of liquidity will be cash flows from operations as well as drawings under our New Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Certain _Financing Arrangements—New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.”_ To manage our liquidity and working capital needs, we have entered into certain cash management arrangements with Deutsche Bank. These arrangements are provided to us on customary terms in the ordinary course of business and include, amongst others, zero balancing cash pooling and the collection of direct debits. We will continue to utilize these services following the Issue Date. Any obligations arising in connection with these cash management arrangements may be secured on the Collateral in priority to the Notes. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in the year ended December 31, 2020, we implemented a number of measures to safeguard our liquidity, including drawing down a new €78 million term loan facility (which resulted in additional liquidity of €68 million net of costs) and accessing €40 million of funds provided by our Sponsor. Furthermore, we made selective use of economic stimulus and government support programs where available, including furlough programs and government grants to assist with lease payments. In addition, we reduced or postponed investments and expenses and, in particular, we implemented a sustainable reduction in maintenance capital expenditures, introduced ##### 102 ----- short-time working arrangements for employees and reduced or deferred lease and rental payments in agreement with our landlords.

The increase was primarily driven by a €33.3 million improvement in the cash impact of changes in payables, from a payable outflow of €14.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020 to an inflow of €19.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021. This positive impact was partially offset by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in our group result before income taxes decreasing by €13.0 million from the three months ended March 31, 2020 to the three months ended March 31, 2021.

This increase was primarily due to a positive impact from working capital, namely increased trade payables and lower trade receivables, partly offset by the impact of the COVID-19, which resulted in a significantly lower EBITDA compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020.

This decrease was mainly due to the sharp decrease in operating profit caused by the COVID-19 pandemic during the course of 2020.

This decrease was primarily driven by payments for granted loans of €4.8 million in 2020 which was incurred in 2020 but not in 2021 and payments for acquisitions of affiliated companies decreased by €3.4 million. On a Pre-IFRS 16 basis, our cash flow from investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2021 would have been an outflow of €5.4 million compared to an outflow of €15.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was mainly due to our higher outflows in the three months ended March 31, 2020 due to the acquisition of Xpert Parkering Swede AB and loans to our Belgian joint venture, ParcBrux BV.

This increase was primarily driven by the lower outflow incurred in 2020. In the three months ended March 31, 2020, we paid a €90 million dividend to our principal shareholder, which was partly offset by a €131.0 million inflow from payments received from long-term financial debt. This positive impact did not reoccur in 2021 and with other movements within this section remaining stable year-on-year, there was a higher outflow in 2021. On a Pre-IFRS 16 basis, our cash flow from financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2021 would have been an outflow of €8.1 million compared to an inflow of €33.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to financial liabilities which increased in the three months ended March 31, 2020, offset by a dividend payout we made in the three months ended March 31, 2020 which did not reoccur in the three months ended March 31, 2021.

In the year ended December 31, 2020, payments received from long-term financial debt increased to €205.1 million. In addition, we repaid lease liabilities and financial liabilities in the amount of €140.7 million (compared to €101.2 million in 2019) and incurred interest payments, bank charges and transaction costs in the amount of €80.5 million (compared to €68.1 million in 2019), including interest on lease liabilities in the amount of €52.1 million (compared to €50.6 million in 2019). In addition, in the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid a dividend to our principal shareholder which resulted in a cash outflow of €90.0 million, partly offset by an equity injection by our principal shareholders which resulted in a cash inflow of €40.0 million. On a Pre-IFRS 16 basis, our cash flow from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have been €85.1 million compared to €16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the increase in financial debt which was partly offset by the dividend payment to our shareholder.

This increase was primarily driven by a redemption of liabilities from finance leases as a result of the the implementation of IFRS 16. In the year ended December 31, 2019, interestbearing loans from third parties increased to €42.2 million, primarily to fund the company acquisitions conducted in 2019. In addition, we repaid lease liabilities in the amount of €101.2 million (compared to €6.4 million from finance leasing in 2018) and incurred interest payment, bank charges and transaction costs in the amount of €68.1 million (compared to €20.5 million in 2018), including interest on lease liabilities in the amount of €50.6 million.

Examples include the new installation or the replacement of prior operator equipment with new parking equipment (barrier systems, lane branding, servers, cash machines and other payment points). - Digital infrastructure capital expenditures relate to investments in our digitalization strategy, including the inclusion of the car park onto our FLOW platform. Renewal capital expenditures comprises investments related to renewed contracts and include the upgrade of existing equipment or refurbishing the appearance of car parks (new lane branding, paint, lighting etc.). Maintenance capital expenditures relate to the maintenance of car parks within our lease portfolio. Examples include necessary repairs of broken equipment, lighting, or regulatory required upgrades, for example to cash or card payment machines. Car & overhead capital expenditures include investments in cars for operational and overhead staff as well as investments related to headquarters or non-operational functions, such as ERP updates, information technology hardware & software. The level of capital expenditures at any given parking facility varies depending on whether the facility is subject to a lease or management contract.

Liquidity at the level of both the Group and the national companies is monitored continuously. A Group liquidity status report is compiled daily for this purpose.

These discounted cash flows are calculated on the basis of five-year forecasts which are prepared in line with financial plans authorized by the Management Board. The cash flow forecasts take into consideration historical data and are based on the Management Board’s best estimates of future development.

Generally, the parking infrastructure and parking operations and management business, has limited demand risk and limited direct competition. Additionally, the industry benefits from a degree of regulatory protection and stability because it provides a critical service to municipalities. The number of car parking spaces has been growing in Europe driven by a variety of factors which include urbanization and an increase in the number of cars. The profitability of the sector is generally improving, supported by scale efficiencies, the implementation of cost savings programs and the utilization of digital based technologies, among others. In aggregate, there are 24 million parking spaces in APCOA’s geographies, of which approximately 60% are off-street and 40% are on-street. APCOA’s top 6 countries (Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, Sweden, Denmark and Norway) account for 18 million of these spaces, of which 11 million are offstreet. Despite approximately 40% of European parking spaces being on-street, major industry players are focused on the off-street segment due to legislation that restricts private operators from operating onstreet car spaces. Parking spaces located in cities and shopping centers are the two largest sectors in Europe, accounting for 70% of regulated off-street parking spaces.",,,,N/A

Parking spaces located in airports typically have a lower rotation given travelling passengers stay for days to weeks at a time (except for drop-off parkers). Landlords are mainly sophisticated airport operators / owners given the importance and size of the business with relevant negotiation power upon contract renewal. Given the growing importance of car parking economics within airport activities, in a few cases airport operators have decided to keep the management of parking spaces in-house in order to realize all car park economics despite a lack of operating experience.

We offer motorists various services related to on-street and off-street parking via smartphone applications and end customer-oriented websites. These services cover the entire parking customer experience, from searching for and reserving a parking space, navigating to the parking garage, contactless entry and exit, and electronic payment. This saves motorists from having to draw a ticket, walk to the ticket machine or cash machine and pay with cash, making the parking process easier, faster and more comfortable for the end customer. These digital services also allow for additional yield management through differentiated pricing according to the number of available spaces, distribution channel, location and size of specific parking spaces and customer groups. We operate our clients’ parking assets through two business models, lease contracts and management contracts. In each of these models, we run parking operations for our clients without incurring significant capital expenditures and thus through an “asset light” approach that is flexible and scalable, because we operate the facilities as opposed to owning them. Our long-term underlying contract structures provide us with stability of revenues and the ability to forecast and plan. As of March 31, 2021, our average contract life (including extensions) for our top 100 contracts (based on weighted average Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution for the year ended December 31, 2019) was approximately 31 years with an average remaining life of approximately 12 years. - _Lease Contracts. We lease parking sites from our clients, where we are responsible for running the parking operations and driving site-revenue. We receive parking fees directly from the consumers parking in our leased sites and we pay rent to the lessor, either as a fixed rent, a variable rent or a combination of fixed and variable rent payments. We focus on driving yield at the site by increasing parking volume and price. We have a mix of short and long-term parking customers at our leased sites. Short-term parking includes customers who pay on a perhour or per-day basis. Short-term parking generated 53% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. Long-term, or contract parking revenue, includes customers holding season tickets, including monthly, quarterly and annual season tickets, and individual customers and business customers who may contract for multiple spaces. Long-term contract parking generated 11% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. Short-term parking customers provide immediate payment in cash, by debit or credit cards, or through payment apps at the location of our parking facilities. In addition, in some countries, including Norway and Sweden, short-term parking customers are charged via invoice after the parking event has been completed, for which we charge an additional fee payable by the consumer. Contract parking customers provide advance payments which contribute to revenue stability and a favorable net working capital profile.

Our lease contract business generated 76% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. - _Management contracts. Our management business represents the fees we receive for managing parking facilities under contracts with third parties including public authorities as well as private landlords and other private entities. Under these contracts we also advise on driving revenue and traffic to the site. We are responsible for running the parking operations and providing the car parking technology, which is often purchased through us but paid and owned by the client. We are incentivized to meet a fixed contractual service level for which we receive a fixed management fee from our client, and may also receive additional incentive fees. We do not pay rent to our client, and the clients benefit from the fees paid by customers parking their cars at these locations (which they receive either directly or through us, but which we typically do not recognize as revenue). At sites under management contracts, we focus on maximizing operational efficiency and scale and do not bear the risk of reduced traffic volumes and make limited to no capital investments.

Our parking enforcement services (issuing penalty notices on private land and administering fines in public spaces) help our clients increase parking compliance and safety and reduce abuse, over-stays and unwanted parking. These services include the patrolling of parking facilities owned or leased by our clients, the issuance and collection of parking fines, the management of debt collection and the provision of impartial representation and appeals services. We offer our parking enforcement services mainly in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Poland and the United Kingdom. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated revenues of €157 million, or 21.8% of our total revenue from parking enforcement services. We also provide an extended range of ancillary services, including traffic management, taxi management, shuttle management, valet parking, trolley services, parking space monitoring, security and cleaning, advertising space marketing, e-solutions such as online booking platforms, apps and electronic payment methods, collection services to parking facility owners as well as 24/7 support and advising property owners on commercial and technical asset management as well as, in certain circumstances, the planning, financing, construction and operation of multi-storey car parks and parking spaces. In addition, we have recently introduced “APCOA Urban Hubs,” which expands our core business through new partnerships with participants across the mobility, logistics, electrification and technology sectors. The COVID-19 pandemic led to the acceleration of the e-commerce penetration, on-demand proximity services, proliferation of new mobility models and increased automation. These services require substantial city-based infrastructure. Our APCOA Urban Hubs offer this infrastructure with dedicated parking areas that can be used for alternative services, such as the long-term and short-term storage of goods, trans-shipping for trucks and electric bikes for last mile deliveries, fleet parking for logistics companies, shared vehicle and other mobility services and EV charging stations for fleet and micro mobility like electric scooters and bikes. In addition, APCOA Urban Hubs offer fixed infrastructure such as the installation of 5G antennas, solar panels and wind energy generation. Our APCOA Urban Hubs typically require low capital expenditures from us as our partners usually bear the cost of installation of any required infrastructure. We created APCOA Urban Hubs with the aim of establishing a new business segment for the use of parking spaces by B2B partners initially with an increasing B2C offering in the medium term. To date, we have opened 179 APCOA Urban Hubs focusing primarily on Germany, Denmark and the United Kingdom. As the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the need to find alternative uses for parking spaces, we expect that APCOA Urban Hubs will be a substantial part of our business going forward, reducing risk by providing further diversification of our revenue streams. We have recently signed contracts with significant participants in this evolving market, in addition to pursuing a healthy pipeline of additional Urban Hubs opportunities. ##### 121 ----- For the year ended December 31, 2019, our revenue was €720.6 million, our Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA was €83.7 million and our Pro Forma Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA was €99.3 million.",,,,N/A
57,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.94,Strengths,1.94.1,Leading Parking Infrastructure Operator in Europe,"We are one of the leading car park infrastructure operators in the European parking market. We operate approximately 11,700 parking facilities, and have increased our parking facilities from 1.3 million in 2016 to over 1.6 million parking spaces as of March 31, 2021. We believe we have the leading or second largest market share by number of parking spaces in each of our ten largest markets. Our leading position helps provide strong brand value, which has allowed us to achieve above-market growth in recent years in our key countries. Our well-developed operational capabilities provide us with a highly scalable platform through which we can add additional facilities and services at a moderate incremental cost. We have been able to efficiently consolidate other European parking operations by acquiring smaller operators, including Real Estate Schaffhausen GmbH, Alpina Deutschland GmbH, OnePark A/S, Security Park AS, Profectum AS, Nationwide Controlled Parking Systems Limited, Mobile Research Solutions Limited and Xpert Parkering Sweden AB. We have a large presence in the top cities by population in each of our markets, which leads to density-related synergies. Our pan-European presence allows us to serve our clients across a wide range of European geographies and makes us a partner of choice for key pan-European property owner and investor corporate accounts. We believe that our attractive locations, digital offering with direct customer interactions and internal data on frequencies and customer behavior help us drive favorable pricing. We are able to use our scale to operate our car park portfolio in an efficient manner, which allows us to realize synergies and also makes us an attractive partner for our clients. For example, our scale enables us to share resources among our car parks (in particular, in clusters where we operate multiple parking facilities in close proximity) including maintenance and supervisory staff, as well as management resources in respect of parking customer service, client support, accounting, marketing, human resources, insurance and tax matters. Due to our size and scale, we are better equipped to make significant investments in IT and parking lot technology and to leverage such investments across our operations compared to smaller competitors. Our information technology services cover the entire parking customer experience from searching for and reserving a parking space through to navigating to the parking garage, contactless entry and exit and electronic payment. In 2018 we launched our APCOA FLOW platform, which is based on a central, open and scalable digital platform which connects the vast majority of our leased parking garages, including parking technology, with its customers and their vehicles via a cloud solution including smartphone apps. We are also in the process of upgrading our APCOA Flow platform to provide real time data on occupancy and availability of our parking facilities, thereby enabling us to better anticipate and predict customer demand. APCOA FLOW also provides us with a direct channel to our end customers, allowing us to offer tailor-made products, differentiated prices and convenience thereby increasing customer loyalty and frequency of use. These operational efficiencies and incremental revenues generated through information technology initiatives and investments allow us to offer a compelling product to customers and landlords. APCOA FLOW is also a key element of our new APCOA Urban Hubs initiative.",,,,N/A
57,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.94,Strengths,1.94.2,Large and Structurally Attractive Growing Market,"During 2018, the European parking market generated approximately €28 to 29 billion in revenues, with approximately €11 to 12 billion spent on outsourcing parking management of which over €6 billion was spent on off-street management in our top six markets. The European parking market grew by 4-5% annually from 2013 to 2018, primarily as a result of new outsourcing, increased pricing and increased ##### 122 ----- volume through better utilization and new builds, in particular in larger cities. We expect that outsourcing will continue to increase as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as clients seek to lower their costs by partnering with operators like us who can provide economies of scale and provide alternative uses such as through our APCOA Urban Hubs initiative. The countries in which we operate have seen steady parking revenue growth and increasing personal car fleet levels over the past decade. The large and growing car fleet in Europe included over 240 million vehicles in 2019. From 2013 to 2019, the number of passenger car registrations in Europe increased by between 12 and 15 million vehicles per year. In 2020 this trend was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Summary— _Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.” The off-street parking industry in Europe is highly fragmented_ with a limited number of large players who have the scale to operate their business as efficiently as we do. Our client acquisition strategy is largely focused on first time outsourcing. We believe there is continued strong outsourcing penetration potential in Europe, as currently approximately 50% of the European parking market by revenue is run by business or property owners and not otherwise outsourced to specialized parking operators. In addition, we believe that there will be continued growing demand for outsourcing in parking due to the increased adoption of technologies, the increased consumer demand for digital services, the increased level of sophistication required in yield management, increased budget pressure on municipalities and the necessity to decrease costs through economies of scale. Approximately 80% of our average Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution from new business during 2018, 2019 and 2020 results from first time outsourcing. We believe that off-street parking is expected to benefit from key trends in the industry, including, for example: the regulatory shift away from on-street parking with reduced on-street parking provisions in city centers, increasing prices of on-street parking and the introduction of electric cars, which require EV charging spaces that off-street parking can offer. As a result, based on the market report prepared by an international management consultant firm, outsourced parking consumer spend is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 4% between 2018 and 2023. (1) Total parking market valued at €28-29 billion in 2018. ##### 123 ----- We also believe that parking facilities will benefit from the ongoing transformation of off-street car park facilities into multi-modal urban hubs. We have focused on four case-use groups to increase our revenue derived from urban hubs: mobility modality, new technology and services, logistics and electrification. Modality improvements provide inter-modal and multi-modal transports from one location. Ride share providers use parking facilities as hubs to provide these journeys, or rent shared cars, electric scooters or bikes from these facilities. New technology and services involves integrating proximity and community services from our locations through our digital platform. In addition, in October 2020 we demonstrated, together with Bosch/Daimler, automated valet parking for vehicles with autonomous driving capabilities at Stuttgart airport. Logistics services includes using urban facilities as fulfillment centers for logistics, storage and distribution services, such as Amazon drop boxes and overnight delivery package storage. Electrification includes providing connected charging services for EVs, fleet and micro mobility like electric scooters and bikes. We currently provide consumers access to over 2,000 third-party owned charging stations at our parking facilities, which is being further expanded. There are significant barriers to entry for new entrants in the car park industry in Europe, including required investments in building the required operational know-how and digital infrastructure and the economies of scale that result from achieving local density. In addition, our long-standing relationships with our clients enable an ongoing dialogue with them as contracts approach renewal and provide us with an opportunity to sign pre-emptive renewals usually involving upgrading the parking equipment in return for a new long-term contract. Our focus on outsourcing, not ownership, allows us to develop key accounts for whom we operate multiple locations across multiple geographies.",,,,N/A
57,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.94,Strengths,1.94.3,Diversified Portfolio with Long-Term Contract Base,"Our business benefits from a portfolio of parking facilities and parking spaces which is highly diversified in terms of the geographical distribution, number of contracts, type of contract, number of clients, number of customers and types of customers we serve. Our parking facilities are diversified across most of Europe and even our largest market (Germany) only represents approximately 33% of our total Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution, with five other countries (Denmark, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Norway) each contributing approximately 10% of our Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution in the year ended December 31, 2019. We cover parking facilities for a wide range of business sectors, such as city and shopping, travel, healthcare & education, events and hospitality, and parking enforcement. Furthermore, many of our parking facilities are typically not dedicated to a single institution, business or purpose and are multi-functional, in the sense that they are used by motorists that visit a variety of locations, whether for work, shopping, other cultural activities or other purposes. We believe our limited reliance on any single geography, customer base or contract helps reduce our cash flow volatility. Our top ten car parks represented 18% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019, while our largest car park represented less than 5% of our revenue during the same period. We are highly selective when evaluating contract opportunities and we only provide such services to the extent that they comply with our margin and profitability criteria. We operate parking facilities under long-term leases with a typical initial duration of ten to fifteen years, with an option to extend for another five to ten years mostly at our sole discretion and management contracts with a typical duration of three to eight years. Our top 100 existing lease and management contracts (based on weighted average Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution for the year ended December 31, 2019) have an average of approximately 12 years remaining. The average duration for our top 100 contracts (based on weighted average Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution) has increased from 23.5 years in 2016 to 31.1 years in 2021. We have very low contract concentration, with over 5,900 contracts across over 11,700 parking facilities. We typically have over 96% annual retention. In addition, on average, contracts representing only 5% of our total Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution for the year ended December 31, 2019 are up for renewal in each of the next five years. We benefit from significant revenue visibility in that more than 90% of our revenue typically comes from contracted car parks prior to the start of any year and such contracted car parks typically provide a stable and predictable revenue generation. We have a disciplined and proactive contract renewal framework to maximize retention while safeguarding profitability. ##### 124 ----- We believe we are well-positioned for a recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic due to the structure of our portfolio, which provides long-term revenue visibility. Furthermore, we continued to invest in new businesses and acquire new contracts during the pandemic, securing new business contracts in 2020 equivalent to €13.2 million in annualized Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution. As of May 31, 2021, we valued our unweighted pipeline of new parking contracts at approximately €80 million of Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution. Our current unweighted pipeline of new contracts has constantly remained high at approximately €75 million of Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution since January 2020 and over €65 million since the fourth quarter in 2018. We expect this to contribute significantly to our portfolio, revenue and margin growth going forward once utilization levels recover to the pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels.",,,,N/A
57,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.94,Strengths,1.94.4,Asset-Light Business Model With a Flexible Cost Base and Optimal Return on Capital,"We operate our clients’ parking assets through two business models: lease contracts and management contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our operations under lease contracts generated 76% of our revenues, and operations under our management contracts generated 24% of our revenues. In each of these models, we run parking operations for our clients without incurring significant capital expenditures and through an asset light approach that is flexible and scalable, because we operate the facilities as opposed to owning them. Our asset light model benefits from an attractive payback period of approximately one year on new business investments, mainly in parking and equipment technology. Our long-term underlying contract structures provide visibility and stability and we seek to negotiate for contractual flexibility in the event of material adverse changes on sites that are outside of our control. For the facilities we operate under leases, we generate our fees based on tariffs charged directly to car park users, which allows us to apply our yield management expertise to increase volumes and prices. We have a balanced level of fixed lease costs (42% of fixed rent as a percentage of total rent in the year ended December 31, 2019 on a pre-IFRS 16 basis) because most of our leases provide for a mix of fixed and variable rent payments, the variable portion of which is based on the actual revenue earned by us at the location subject to the lease. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 58% of our €345 million of pre-IFRS 16 rent expense was variable rents. In the year ended December 31, 2020, when our business was adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the variable rents provided an immediate expense buffer with our variable rent expense decreasing by €111 million compared to our original budgeted variable rent expense for the period. In the year ended December 31, 2020, 46% of our pre-IFRS 16 rent expense was variable. The management fees charged by us under our management contracts typically increase each year in line with inflation, and often include additional incentive fees depending on the performance of the facility. Compared to the substantial decrease in our lease contract revenue due the COVID-19 pandemic, our management contract revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 only decreased by 10% compared to the previous year, as our clients continued to need our services and were required to make payments despite lower parking volumes.",,,,N/A
57,Preliminary Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.94,Strengths,1.94.5,"Strong Financial Profile, with Successful Management Execution resulting in Growth, Profitability and High Cash Conversion","Our business model provides us with long-term cash flow visibility as a result of our strategic focus on operating our facilities through long-term contracts, recurring business through seasonal parking customers, parking playing a central role in the local economy as well as our ability to accurately estimate our revenue and profitability and analyze trends in working capital and capital expenditure. Our long-term cash flow visibility is furthered by the favorable and stable regulatory environment in the markets in which we operate as well as by certain contractual protections for us in our lease and management contracts. Between 2015 and 2019, we achieved 20 quarters of consecutive year-on-year profit growth up to the end of 2019 (measured on the basis of Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution). Parking demand in a particular market is typically correlated to the total size of the car fleet in that market (rather than GDP), which enhances the stability of our revenues over long periods and helps provide resilience through periods of economic downturn. Our revenue has benefitted from positive structural trends such as increasing motor vehicle fleet in our markets, a move from on-street parking to off-street parking and ##### 125 ----- increasing levels of outsourcing, but it has also benefitted from the successful implementation of strategic expansions by our management team, focusing on clients who outsource operations or management of their parking facilities for the first time, and achieving high retention rates of typically over 95% for the past five years. In addition, between 2015 and 2019, we increased our Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA profit margin from 8.8% to 11.6%, primarily as a result of the implementation of cost savings and operational efficiency measures and better yield management through, for example, dynamic pricing that we offer across 69 of our sites, all of which were implemented by our current management team which joined in 2016 and early 2017. Our revenue increased at a CAGR of 2.3% between 2016 and 2019, primarily driven by like-for-like growth and the acquisitions of OnePark A/S and Nationwide Controlled Parking Systems Limited, offset by the non-renewal of our contract with Oslo Airport, which we decided not to pursue aggressively due to low margins. This like-for-like revenue growth was driven by a combination of tariff increases, length of stay and volume management across all core countries. In addition, between January 2019 and March 31, 2021, we completed five bolt-on acquisitions with attractive synergies. We believe our scale, stability and industry experience facilitates our ability to win new business, with a 75% win rate in 2020 for all contracts bid on. Our management team has also implemented a differentiated approach to both our key pan-European and local clients, which has resulted in an increase in the share of new business that is generated from relationships with key accounts. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 60% of our new business was generated by key accounts, compared to 11% in 2016. We typically have separate agreements for each of our facilities with our key accounts, with differing durations and renewal dates. We believe we have strong relationships with our key accounts and that there is continued growth potential. As of March 31, 2021, we had over 4,800 clients. Our parking facilities, once operational, require relatively low levels of capital expenditures. Our limited maintenance capital expenditures, which averaged less than 1% of revenue in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 are driven by the capital-light nature of our business. Our cash flow generation benefits from an advantageous working capital cycle through the collection of upfront payments (through season tickets) from our long-term parking customers and revenue collection directly upon exit from a car park for our short-term parking customers. We implemented a net working capital optimization program in 2017 aimed at extending supplier terms and payment cycles and improving collection and payment processes. As a result of our low capital expenditure and working capital requirements, we benefit from a high level of cash conversion and achieved an adjusted cash conversion ratio of 92.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019 on a Pre-IFRS 16 basis. We consistently increased our adjusted free cash flow (before expansion capital expenditures) from 2016 to 2019 by a CAGR of 30.4%. ##### 126 ----- Below is a chart showing our Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA, Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA margins, adjusted free cash flows and adjusted cash conversion ratios from 2016 to 2020:",,,,N/A

79,Preliminary Offerings 2022.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.1.1,"Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the current COVID-19 public health pandemic.","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had, and any possible future outbreaks could have, an adverse effect on us. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the reactions of governmental and other authorities to contain, mitigate or combat the pandemic, have severely restricted the level of economic activity worldwide, and have impacted, and are expected to continue to impact, our operations. Further, the nature, extent and duration of the impact of COVID-19 or any future disease or adverse health condition is highly uncertain and beyond our control. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing lockdowns, curtailing travel, school closures, prohibitions of mass gatherings, mandatory remote working, and in some countries, limitations on the ability to access production facilities and office buildings. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused significant economic dislocation in many of the countries in which we operate and sell our products, which has resulted in an unprecedented slowdown in economic activity and a related increase in unemployment. Were a recession to occur as a result of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot predict the length of such recession or the short- and long-term impact it may have on the global economy or our business specifically. Resurgences or further outbreaks of COVID-19 are also likely to occur. We cannot predict when or where any further outbreaks may occur, their duration, how far into the future we may experience outbreaks nor can we predict with any certainty the impacts of such subsequent outbreaks, including the impacts of future national or local lockdowns or other measures implemented by national and/or local authorities. As of September 2021, COVID-19 outbreaks were significantly affecting many countries, including Germany, the United States and other countries in which we operate, with cases rising markedly and with new, more contagious strains of the virus emerging. Any or all such consequences may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The global COVID-19 pandemic has had a material impact on economic activity across our markets and on our business in 2020 and at the start of 2021. In this period, we experienced decreased volumes as non-essential surgeries were postponed and customers had to cancel orders or shift delivery dates given the lower demand from clinics, which negatively impacted our revenue. Performance in Industrials markets has been impacted by a global industrial down-cycle that started in 2019 that which was further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We also experienced COVID-19 related involuntary plant closures between the February 2020 and August 2020, and again in July 2021, which negatively impacted revenue and EBITDA for the respective periods. In particular, our factories in Malaysia were required to shut down in March and April of 2020, and again in July 2021, following general government directives. Our factory in China also had to close for two weeks in the beginning of February 2020, which negatively impacted sales. In India, lockdowns in March and April 2020 that extended to mid-May 2020 in some regions and subsequent production slowdowns negatively impacted business until August 2020. In addition, we experienced a slowdown in most of our facilities as a result of delays of customer orders, while one of our subsidiaries operating in mobility end-markets, Emil Müller Group, also had to slow production following shutdowns at its major customers due to the lack of raw materials and other components, which negatively impacted revenue. Our manufacturing costs were also impacted by COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of such factory closures, costs for cleaning and safety measures, illness rates and quarantines. As a result, revenue decreased by 22.8% from the first quarter of 2020 to the second quarter of 2020. Overall, we experienced a decrease in revenue of 10.9% in 2020 as compared to 2019. We implemented a large number of measures to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including among others providing all employees at our German sites with free FFP2 masks, distributing two free COVID-19 self-tests per week, allowing all indirect employees to work from home over an extended period and implementing hygiene -32 ----- measures for direct shop-floor employees, such as separation walls. In addition, we eliminated business travel for our employees, adopted restrictions regulating visits of third-party staff to our facilities and, for a period of time, tested our own staff regularly before allowing entry to our facilities. We also implemented short-time work (Kurzarbeit) measures to reduce working hours, from time to time, depending on the specific situation affecting the relevant plant and our customers. We have also incurred certain costs in connection with implementing these mitigating measures. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we continue to enforce safety measures depending on both country-specific regulations and plant-specific requirements, reviewing on a regular basis any changes to the measures implemented at a given time, in order to quickly adjust to changing scenarios. However, these actions may not fully mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, or adequately protect against any outbreaks of COVID-19 at our facilities and offices. We also still remain vulnerable to further lockdowns and COVID-19-inspired adverse events in the short-term, which could result in increasing volatility during 2022. We cannot predict the degree to, or the period over which, we will be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Given evolving government policies and the emergence of new variants of COVID-19 and despite the development and ongoing rollouts of vaccines, there may be further impacts on the economies or the consumer purchasing power of the countries where we operate. Any of the foregoing including any resulting deterioration in general economic conditions or change in consumer behavior, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the top four Medical markets customers made up 44% of our Medical markets revenue and the top ten customers accounted for 63% of its revenue. Our customers are orthopedic implant OEMs, including the top orthopedic implant OEMs who together have a strong presence in the global hip implant market. Any consolidation in our customer base for hip implant products could result in further pricing pressure which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition results of operations and prospects.

Our BIOLOX[®] products are considered an industry benchmark in the market for ceramic joint replacements. The success of our BIOLOX[®] products is largely dependent on our close collaborative partnerships with orthopedic manufacturers, material scientists and surgeons, and any negative perception of the quality of these products could have a material adverse impact on our business.

With some of our customers, we have short-term contracts that will soon expire if not renewed. See also “—We rely on a limited number of large customers, in particular in the Medical _markets, for a significant part of our revenues and our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if our relationship with any of our key customers deteriorates or ends.” While negotiations for the renewal of these_ contractual relationships are currently ongoing, the relevant customers may decide not to renew their contract with the Group. Any loss of such a customer could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and the inability to retain such customers, or to replace business generated by such customers, may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. As a result, the loss or deterioration of such relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition results of operations and prospects. In addition, we believe that our customers are increasingly looking for strong, long-term relationships with a few key suppliers that help them improve product performance, reduce costs, or support new product development. This is largely due to our customers’ needs for tailored products that very often require joint development efforts. However, even in cases where we co-develop a product with a customer, it will be for one application only. If our customer develops or upgrades a product or process, we need to offer a newly tailored product meeting our customer’s new specifications. This may require us to invest more in research and development and to increase marketing costs so that we can strengthen existing customer relationships as well as attract new customers. If our key competitors are able to innovate faster, spend more on R&D, or generally develop technology for ceramic products or comparable products from substitute materials more cost effectively or with a higher quality, our customers may opt to work with our competitors instead of us. Inability to keep key customers and failure to attract new customers due to a perceived lack of innovation could materially affect our reputation which would further reduce our ability to compete. We believe that product quality, product specifications, innovation and customer service are key competitive factors for our business. If we are unable to develop, produce or market our products effectively to our existing or new customers, we may lose key customers or fail to acquire new customers.

Changes in these regulations or failure by us or our customers to comply with them could adversely affect our business.","Regulatory requirements for our medical products as well as components for such medical products are complex, costly and far reaching. Any failure to comply with them could subject us and/or our customers to fines, injunctions, civil penalties, lawsuits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial of government approvals, withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecution. Any of these actions could adversely impact our revenue, undermine goodwill established with our customers, damage commercial prospects for our products and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Globally, our products are marketed in more than 65 countries and each of these countries may regulate our products and processes differently. In the United States, before we or our customers can market a new medical device, or a new use of, new claim for or significant modification to, an existing product, we or they must first receive either clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or approval of a premarket approval (or “PMA”), from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. Certain of our DENSILOX[®] implant products have received marketing authorization pursuant to the 510(k) clearance process, and our OEM customers have obtained 510(k) clearances and PMA approvals for certain products that utilize our BIOLOX[®] components. Obtaining FDA clearances or approvals for any new medical devices or modifications to existing medical devices can be time consuming and can be delayed or rejected by the FDA for many reasons. In the United States, the manufacture and supply of our ceramic ball head and cup inserts for hip joint prostheses systems is subject to the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, which imposes current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements on the manufacture of medical devices. While we have successfully completed FDA audits and audits by our customers in the past, there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so in the future. In addition, our medical device customers to whom we supply our ceramic ball head and cup inserts are subject to FDA regulation, including premarket approval and post market compliance requirements of their hip joint prostheses systems. In the EU, our medical products are required to comply with the essential requirements under the EU Medical Devices Regulation, which entered into force in May 2021. This new regulation generally increases standards applicable to -34 ----- conformity assessment procedures and requires more stringent scrutiny by notified bodies when conducting audits, among other things. Compliance with these requirements entitles us and our customers to affix a CE mark to the medical devices verifying products meet EU safety, health or environmental requirements. As implantable devices for hip joint prostheses, certain of our medical products are considered high risk medical devices falling within Class III. Our customers therefore have to undergo a recurring conformity assessment procedure including stringent audits by a so called “notified body” for these products. Unless our customers successfully complete this conformity assessment, they do not have the right to carry the CE mark. Without the CE mark, the customers’ medical devices cannot be commercialized in the European Union. Compliance with relevant regulations is monitored by the respective authorities of EU member states. Furthermore, our customers are subject to other legal regulatory requirements in additional end-markets, such as, for example, China, which we continuously monitor. Changes to these regulations or non-compliance by our customers or by us can lead to market withdrawals of our products and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations The FDA may take several years or longer to grant premarket approval of our or our customers’ new medical devices, if at all. European conformity assessment procedures are equally challenging and time consuming. Further, our competitors may seek pre-market approval for products that compete with our medical products for ceramic hip joint prostheses. At any time, our customers’ total hip prostheses systems may be withdrawn from the market either voluntarily by our customers or as a result of the FDA’s or a foreign equivalent’s withdrawal of marketing approval or removal of such products for a number of reasons including safety, current Good Manufacturing Practice or Quality System Regulation problems with our products or our customers’ final products. For example, a customer initiated a voluntary recall in August 2010 of its hip implant system.

Specifically in the United States, certain of our customers’ hip joint prostheses systems have obtained PMA approval or 510(k) clearance from the FDA. Governmental regulations relate to the testing, development, manufacturing, labeling, design, sale, promotion, distribution, importing, exporting and shipping of our products. We cannot assure you that any regulatory clearances or approvals, either foreign or domestic, will be granted or maintained for our key medical customers’ new products that include our products on a timely basis, if at all. If our key medical customers are unable to obtain regulatory approvals or clearances for use of their medical devices, the commercial success of our products could be limited. Regulators may also limit the claims that we or our customers can make about our products. Approval processes differ in the United States, Europe, Asia and other jurisdictions and the approval in the U.S. or any other single jurisdiction does not guarantee approval in any other jurisdiction. Obtaining foreign approvals for our customers’ medical devices could involve significant delays, difficulties and costs for our customers, which could adversely affect the commercial success of our products. If the FDA or any other regulatory authority does not grant the necessary marketing authorizations for our customers’ medical devices, due to deficiencies of our products or any other component used in our customers’ medical devices, our customers may no longer be able to market their medical devices in their markets or may even choose to switch to another supplier. As a result, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We and our customers are required to pass inspections and to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in order for our customers to continue to sell their hip joint prostheses systems. Any failure to pass an inspection or to comply with regulatory requirements could adversely impact our operations through a recall or seizure of products, an issuance of warning letters and operating restrictions or the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production or sale of hip joint prostheses systems.

The FDA and other national regulatory bodies have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture of a product or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. The FDA’s authority to require a recall must be based on a finding that there is reasonable probability that the device could cause serious injury or death. We or our medical customers may also choose to voluntarily recall a product if any material deficiency is found.

79,Preliminary Offerings 2022.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.1.9,The existence of adequate coverage and reimbursement is important for the sales of our products. Inadequate coverage and reimbursement policies and changes in health care reimbursement systems in the U.S. and elsewhere could reduce our revenues and profitability.,"Sales of medical devices largely depend on the reimbursement of patients’ medical expenses by government health care programs and private health insurers. Without the financial support of government reimbursement or third-party insurers’ payments for patient care, the market for our medical customers’ hip joint prostheses systems, and in turn, our products, will be limited. In the United States and in certain other jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory reforms that have changed the regulatory and healthcare systems in ways that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act” or the “ACA”)) was enacted, which significantly impacted the medical device industry in the United States. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act imposed an annual excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States, with limited exceptions, beginning in 2013 (the “Medical Device Excise Tax” or the “MDET”). In addition, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Federal agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, establishes payment levels for hospitals and physicians on an annual basis, which can increase or decrease payment to such entities. The ACA also established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee and identify priorities in comparative clinical effectiveness research in an effort to coordinate and develop such research, and created an independent payment advisory board to submit recommendations to reduce Medicare spending if projected Medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate. Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which include, among other things, reductions to Medicare payments to providers, as well as changes made by third-party payors to the reimbursement amounts and/or payment methodologies used to determine such amounts, any of which could have a negative effect on those selling products to hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and surgeons, including medical device manufacturers. Any reduction in such payment amounts could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures. However, there have been recent executive and legislative actions to amend or impede the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and ongoing efforts to repeal, replace or further modify the Affordable Care Act which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, the MDET was suspended for 2018 and 2019 as a result of the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, certain bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. In particular, on January 22, 2018, former President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the MDET on non-exempt medical devices. Since then, The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act 2020, signed into law on December 20, 2019, repealed the MDET. Congress has also enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act such as removing penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate to carry health insurance and delaying the implementation of certain fees mandated by the Affordable Care Act. In addition, former President Trump signed additional executive orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Further, on December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the individual mandate was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling -36 ----- that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states, without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. The full impact on our business of the ACA and other new laws is uncertain. Nor is it clear whether other legislative changes will be adopted, if any, or how such changes would affect the demand for our products. Future actions by the U.S. administration and the U.S. Congress including, but not limited to, repeal or replacement of the ACA could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, all or a portion of the ACA and related subsequent legislation may be modified, repealed or otherwise invalidated through other judicial challenge. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace, which began on February 15, 2021 and remained open through August 15, 2021. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA, will impact the ACA or our business. The current presidential administration and Congress may pursue significant changes to the current healthcare laws. We face uncertainties that might result from modifications or repeal of any of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions. The impact of those changes on us and potential effect on business is currently unknown. Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs and subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may interrupt commercialization of our current and future solutions. Any changes to the Affordable Care Act are also likely to have an impact on our results of operations, and may negatively affect our business, financial condition and prospects. We cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the United States may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The net effect of the Affordable Care Act, as currently in effect, on our business is subject to a number of variables, including the law’s complexity, lack of complete implementing regulations and interpretive guidance, and the sporadic implementation of the numerous programs designed to improve access to and the quality of healthcare services. Additional variables of the Affordable Care Act impacting our business will be how states, providers, insurance companies, employers, and other market participants respond during this period of uncertainty surrounding the future of the Affordable Care Act. Further, sales of medical devices in China are subject to importation authorizations and purchasing tender processes governed by local authorities. In 2021, Chinese authorities published a new system regulating official tenders for medical devices. The growth of our sales volumes in China is dependent on acting in accordance with the relevant purchasing tender authorizations, as applicable from time to time. However, the timing and the magnitude of any changes or updates to these official tender systems remain uncertain, and we may continue to experience significant variability as it relates to our sales in China. In addition, on an international level, medical reimbursement systems vary significantly from country to country, with some countries limiting medical centers’ spending through fixed budgets, regardless of the levels of patient treatment, and other countries requiring application for, and approval of, government or third party reimbursement. Uncertainties regarding future healthcare policy, legislation and regulation, as well as private market practices, could affect our customers’ ability to sell their hip implant system in commercially acceptable quantities at profitable prices and therefore could also impact our revenues, profit margins, operating cash flows and results of operations.",,,,N/A

For example, we may be notified by a customer, patient, treating surgeon, or hospital, alleging that the relevant surgery resulted in the implantation of a medical device that includes a defective component produced by the Group. We have been named as defendants in a number of product liability lawsuits in Europe, substantially all of which alleged various claims against our ceramic hip joint components and, in the past, we were named in lawsuits in the United States relating to broken artificial hip joints. See “—We are subject _to the risk of litigation and other claims” and “Business—Legal Proceedings.”_ In addition many of our products are integrated into our customers’ products, and we may be requested to participate in or share in the costs of a product recall conducted by a customer. For example, we supply products to customers in the mobility industry. In the event one of these customers conducts a product recall that it believes is related to one of our products, we may be asked to participate in or fund in whole or in part such a recall. Our customers often require us to represent that our products conform to certain product specifications provided by our customers. Any failure to comply with such specifications could result in claims or legal action against us. -37 ----- We are unable to estimate our exposure, if any, to the above-mentioned product liability lawsuits at this time. While we do not believe we have any material liability associated with our current litigation and that our provisions for the lawsuits will be sufficient, there can be no assurance that we will not be exposed to material liability. We may be subject to future claims with regard to these suits or others like them and we may not be able to avoid significant product liability exposure. In addition, any such claims may be costly to defend. While we maintain insurance against product liability claims, this insurance is limited to €100 million and there can be no assurance that a claim will be covered. A successful product liability claim or series of claims against us for which we are not otherwise indemnified or insured could materially increase our operating costs or prevent us from satisfying our financial obligations. We may not have sufficient cash flow from operations or assets to pay a judgment resulting from a product liability claim or product recall, if any, for which there is inadequate insurance coverage. Any such judgment or product recall could materially increase our operating costs or prevent us from satisfying our financial obligations and materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, lawsuits relating to alleged deficiencies in our medical products, specifically our ceramic hip replacement components, could materially impact our reputation as a manufacturer of high-quality ceramic components and could lead to the loss of our customers’ FDA market authorizations for hip implants that include our ceramic components or the loss of other regulatory approvals in other jurisdictions and could prevent or delay approvals for future products that include our ceramic components.

In the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, our revenues from customers based in Europe together accounted for 63.6% of our total revenue, with customers based in Germany accounting for 19.7% of our total revenue. Since early 2020, the primary factor in increased uncertainty globally from an economic and social perspective has been the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted, and may continue to result, in materially increased volatility and declines in financial markets and weaker demand in the global economy. Measures implemented, or intended to be implemented, by governments or governmental bodies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on supply chains resulting, for instance, in plant closures or increases in the cost of raw materials, and generally impact business operations across the economy both as a result of weakened economic activity and the employees being affected. Furthermore, global economic conditions have been, and are likely to continue to be, affected by concerns over increased geopolitical tensions as well as international political developments, such as the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union (“Brexit”) on January 31, 2020, the threat of escalated trade disputes on a global level and the collapse of the Afghan government in August 2021. It is difficult to predict how economic conditions will develop, as they are impacted by macro movements of the financial markets and many other factors, including the stock, bond and derivatives markets as well as measures taken by various governmental and regulatory authorities and central banks. Uncertainty remains in the global markets and the global economy could experience another recession, or a depression, which could be more prolonged or have a greater financial impact than the global recessions that began in 2008. Any downturns in general economic conditions that impact consumer spending, particularly in the countries where we sell a significant portion of our products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, the mobility, electronics, construction and other industrial end-markets we serve are cyclical, and both general macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control could reduce demand from any one of these markets for our products. Demand for our products is significantly affected by the business success of our OEM customers as well as end users that purchase products from those OEM customers. For example, weak economic conditions could depress new car sales, negatively impacting our mobility customers, thereby reducing demand for our ceramic components in automobiles and engines. Similarly, reduced global economic activity could hinder global industrial output, which could decrease demand for our ceramic cutting tools and textile components. General economic or industry-specific downturns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A

For example, the industries and end-markets into which we sell our products experience rapid technological change and product improvement, evolving standards, rules and regulations, evolving patient and surgeon needs. Manufacturers in the high performance ceramics business periodically introduce new generations of products or require new technological capacity to develop customized products. In order to remain competitive, we will need to anticipate and respond to these changes, which requires continued investment in, and time spent on, innovation and research and development. -38 ----- While we strive to maintain strong technological capabilities to remain at the forefront of the markets we operate in, the process of developing new, high technology products and services and improving existing products and services is however complex and uncertain. Any failure to anticipate, identify and keep pace with the changing needs of patients, surgeons and OEMs and emerging technological trends, growing use of alternative materials to ceramics such as metal or polymer as materials in the hip implant market, as well as any failure to introduce attractive and innovative products and services, could lead to a decline in the use of the our products and services which could in turn significantly damage our market share and economic results. For example, polyethylene and polymer liners are cheaper than ceramics, while their resistance to wear, when highly cross-linked, is almost equivalent of that of ceramics. In addition, any delay in offering new products and services, or failure to differentiate our products and services or accurately predict and address market trends and demand, could render our products and services less desirable or even obsolete, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Our products could also become obsolete sooner than we expect and be replaced by a new solution, product or material. For example, an alternative treatment to hip joint replacement for osteoporosis patients could be developed or new products that we are currently developing for dental, spine, knee and shoulder implants may not reach the market according to our current planned timeline. Furthermore, the penetration of our hip implant insert components might not grow as expected due to technological improvements of Polyethylene inserts, surgeon preferences, or any perceived issues related to ceramic-on-ceramic hip implants. We must anticipate and respond to industry and customer changes, including by taking advantage of the growing use of ceramic in dental and other orthopedic implants in addition to hip, in order to remain competitive. We may be required to make investments to develop new technologies before knowing whether predictions will accurately reflect customer preferences, or if we are not able to develop the necessary technologies internally, we may have to incur expenses in an attempt to obtain a license or acquire technologies from third parties. Our future growth will depend on our ability to gauge the direction of the commercial and technological progress in all our key end-markets and upon our ability to fund and successfully develop, manufacture and market products for our OEM customers who compete in such changing end-markets. We will have to continue to effectively identify, develop, market and in certain cases, secure regulatory approval for, innovative products on a timely basis to replace or enhance existing products. Because of the lengthy and costly development process, technological challenges and intense competition, we cannot assure you that any of the products and/or technology we are currently developing, or could begin to develop in the future, either alone or with third parties, will result in a technically viable product and achieve substantial commercial success. While we develop products and services that we expect will address new market opportunities that are not yet fully developed (including, for example, the dental implant, spine, knee and shoulder implant markets), there is no guarantee that these new opportunities will develop as we currently anticipate. There is also no guarantee that our products and services will secure broad acceptance from OEMs and surgeons, that such products and services will be consistent with developing industry standards, that we will succeed in gaining market share in these new markets or that we will fully recover investments made in acquiring or developing such products. For example, it is expected that the growth of the usage of ceramics in dental implants will be driven by a combination of factors, including better aesthetics and biocompatibility. However, we may not be able to develop or market technological advances and introduce new products in a manner and to an extent sufficient to remain competitive in this sector. More specifically, we may not be able to invest the human and financial resources required to develop these products or make mistakes or incorrect assessments in our planning with regard to these sectors or encounter difficulties in launching the products. Furthermore, we may not be able to meet the product development and delivery schedules due to unforeseen problems during the design, development or production stages of new products and the introduction of new technologies. Delays in product development may also require further investments in research and development. If there is an increase in costs associated with the development of new products and the improvement of products for which we will not achieve sufficient revenue, the development costs of new products may not be recoverable. An increase in costs or a decrease in revenue from new products, or both, could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Failure to maintain innovation or the introduction of new or updated technologies that respond to needs and preferences of patients, surgeons, OEMs in Medical markets, or our customers in the Industrials markets, or regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our competitiveness and could cause us to lose market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

We face substantial competition from our primary competitors, -39 ----- but also from many other international, national, regional and local competitors of various sizes. Competition is particularly intense in the mobility, electronics and several niche industrial end-markets where product-oriented competition is acute. Various competitors such as 3M Company, Coorstek or Kyocera are larger than us and have greater financial resources. Other competitors are smaller and may be able to offer more specialized products. As such, we face substantial risk that certain events, including new product development by our competitors, changing customer needs, production advances for competing products or the replacement of ceramic products with products made from different materials could result in declining demand for our products and reduce our market shares as our customers switch to our competitors’ products or undertake to manufacture such products on their own. In particular, increasing competition from competitors in Asia may lead to lower prices for our products. Our failure to effectively compete or increased use of substitutes for HPC products could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.",,,,N/A

Currently, we operate facilities in countries such as Germany, the United States, Brazil, India, China, Czech Republic, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Our products are also distributed, directly or indirectly, in more than 65 countries, and our operations are affected directly and indirectly by global regulatory, economic and political conditions. Thus, we are exposed to a range of factors that we cannot easily influence and that could have an impact on our business activities in these countries. These factors include the following: - changes in the rate of economic growth; - political, social, economic, financial and market instability and volatility; - war, terrorist activities or other armed conflict; - foreign currency controls and foreign currency exchange volatility; - changes in government policies and regulations or imperfect application of such regulations; - trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products; - inadequately developed and inconsistent legal and administrative systems, which can lead, for example, to expropriations, the inadequate protection of intellectual property rights or can jeopardize the enforcement of receivables and other claims; - burdensome tariffs and other trade barriers and delays associated with customs procedures, including increased security requirements applicable to foreign goods and measures related to COVID-19 and Brexit; - imposition of confiscatory taxation or adverse taxes, other charges and restrictions on imports, currency, interest and exchange rate risks, changes in double tax treaties; - managing and obtaining support and distribution for local operations; - increased costs and availability of raw materials, transportation or shipping; - credit risk, financial conditions and compliance risk of local customers, distributors and other agents; - risks related to labor practices increasing minimum wages and inflationary pressures, national and regional labor strikes; - increased risk of fraud and corruption; and - the risk that regulations will become less favorable to our business. We may not succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies to counter the foregoing factors effectively in each location where we do business. Our failure to do so could limit our ability to sell products, compete or receive payments for products sold in such locations. As a result, the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. -40 -----",,,,N/A
79,Preliminary Offerings 2022.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.1.15,"Price increases or interruptions in the supply of raw materials, including as a result of increased shipping costs, could have a significant impact on our ability to sustain and grow earnings.","Our manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of raw materials, the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond our control. All raw material costs constituted approximately one third of our cost of products sold. Because the properties we require from our raw materials are highly specific and the properties of these raw materials reflect their manufacturing processes, as well as the specific properties and distinctive characteristics of their precursors, we typically source each type of raw materials only from a single supplier. We have identified more than one suitable raw material supplier only in the case of a few specific raw materials. We keep additional safety stock for most single-sourced raw materials, and our risk management monitors critical suppliers and attempts to identify suitable alternative supply channels, but there can be no guarantee that we any such mitigation efforts will be successful or that our stock will be sufficient in the case of supply chain disruptions. Supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of certain raw materials could result in supply imbalances that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Increases in the price of resources, such as natural gas, petrol, electricity and water, whether as a result of inflation, shortages or interruptions in supply, or otherwise, could also materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects. Our ability to respond to increased costs for raw materials by increasing our prices or implementing alternative processes and supply chains will depend on our ability to anticipate and react to such increases in the contest of the prevailing general economic conditions, as well as the responses of our suppliers, competitors and customers. Each of these factors is difficult to predict and beyond our control. Accordingly, increased costs, and the uncertainty related thereto, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We generally purchase raw materials based on supply agreements, in which prices are fixed for no longer than 12 months. As a result, we may be subject to fluctuations in raw materials prices. These fluctuations limit our ability to accurately forecast future raw material costs and hence our profitability. Our ability to increase the prices of our products in order to pass-on any increases in raw materials costs to our customers is dependent upon our contractual arrangements and economic conditions. If we are not able to fully offset the effects of higher raw materials costs, our financial results could deteriorate. Separately, we are subject to the current trends affecting global shipping. Shipping costs have grown significantly since 2020, due to a number of factors, including imbalances in global trade and countries locking down and reopening at different times due to varying patterns of local COVID-19 outbreaks. In addition, while global demand for shipping has increased robustly over the past year following the easement of lockdown measures due to COVID-19 and the gradual reopening of numerous economies, shipping continued to suffer delays due to port congestion, port closures (including the protracted closures affecting the Ningbo-Zhoushan port in China in August 2021), vessel delays and extraordinary accidents such as the March 2021 Suez Canal closure. In addition, disruptions to or increases in the cost of local, regional domestic or international transportation services for our products due to shortages of vessels, barges, railcars or trucks, weather-related problems, flooding, droughts, accidents, mechanical difficulties, bankruptcy, strikes, lockouts, bottlenecks or other events could increase our costs, temporarily impair our ability to deliver products to our customers on time or at all and might, in certain circumstances, constitute a force majeure event under our customer contracts, permitting our customers to suspend taking delivery of and paying for our products or resulting in a charge to us for our customers’ lost profits as a result of our failure to timely deliver our products. We have experienced an increase in raw material, energy and shipping costs and have experienced delays of deliveries of parts and components from our global suppliers, and of products to our customers, due to which we have recently increased, and plan to further increase, prices for a broad range of products and customers. While these delays and cost increases are not currently at a level that they have caused a material disruption or negative impact to our profitability, these delays and costs may increase to a point that they may negatively impact our financial results and ability to grow our business. Any events leading to price increases and scarcity of raw materials, packaging materials, utilities or freight required to deliver raw materials to our facilities could disrupt our operations, or negatively impact demand for our products if we pass such price increases onto customers and subsequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, either temporarily or permanently.",,,,N/A
79,Preliminary Offerings 2022.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.1.16,Fluctuations in energy costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.,"Energy costs are a significant component of our operating expenses and increasing energy costs, unless offset by more efficient usage or other operational responses, may impact our profitability. Energy purchases in 2020 constituted approximately 5% to 6% of our cost of sales. Energy prices have been volatile in the past and may increase in the future, also given current geopolitical conditions. In addition, energy prices (including the prices for crude oil and natural gas), are subject to a variety of factors beyond our control, such as the domestic and foreign supply dynamics, consumer demand, local regulation and tax regimes and market expectations regarding supply and demand. For example, we recorded a recent dramatic increase in natural gas prices in September of 2021, as global supplies were depleted by a series of extreme weather -41 ----- events (including, most recently, heatwaves in Europe and the US, and Hurricane Ida which forced a production halt in many gas production facilities located in the Gulf of Mexico). In addition, our shipping costs have also increased due to fuel and freight prices affected by the above-mentioned trends. We may not be able to recover these rising costs through increased prices charged to our customers. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in attempts to protect against these increases in energy costs through long-term energy contracts, improved energy procurement, improved efficiency and other operational improvements, the overall costs of operating our stores will increase, which could impact our profitability, financial condition and results of operations. Fluctuations in the price of energy limit our ability to accurately forecast future energy costs and consequently our profitability. Our management expects electricity costs in Germany, where we maintain the majority of our production volumes and energy consumption to increase over the coming years. Rising energy costs may increase our production costs and negatively impact our customers and the demand for their products. These risks will be heightened if our customers or production facilities are in locations experiencing severe energy shortages. If energy prices fluctuate significantly, or we experience severe energy shortages, our business or results of operations may be adversely affected.",,,,N/A

If one or more of our production facilities were to suffer a serious accident, breakdown, equipment malfunction or other unexpected events, a part of our production capacity could be jeopardized and our sales would be materially adversely affected until we repaired or found a replacement for any such facility and/or machinery. Further, our production was reduced or halted in 2020 and 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a significant impact on our business and results during that period. While we maintain insurance to cover property damages and other material damages, depending on the risk and type of asset or property insured, any losses related to a serious accident, equipment malfunction or other unexpected event could exceed the amount of this coverage. Further, any interruption in our production capabilities, generally, will inevitably increase our production costs and reduce our sales and earnings for the affected period. Moreover, any interruption in production capability may require us to make significant capital expenditures to remedy the problem, which could have a negative effect on our profitability and cash flows. We may sustain a loss in revenue in excess of any recoveries we make under our business interruption insurance coverage. Longer-term business disruption could result in a loss of customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In addition, the refurbishment or reconstruction of any of our production facilities or the construction of new facilities could be subject to regulatory approval in the jurisdictions in which they are located, which could result in significant delays in the resumption of product manufacturing.

Further, agreed limits and other restrictions (for example, exclusions) within the insurance coverage may prove to be too low or inadequate for compensating potential damages or losses, ultimately resulting in a gap in the insurance coverage. There can moreover be no assurance that our insurance providers will continue to grant coverage on commercially acceptable terms or at all. For some risks, we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive related to the risks presented. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and, in some instances, certain insurance policies may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. As a result, we may not be able to renew our insurance policies or procure other desirable insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, there are risks left intentionally uninsured (such as, but not limited to, customer or supplier insolvency, industrial disputes or specific natural hazards), and we therefore have no insurance against these events. If we sustain damages, losses or liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage, if we encounter a delay in the payment of insurance proceeds, or if we have to pay higher insurance premiums or encounter restrictions on insurance coverage, this may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A

79,Preliminary Offerings 2022.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.1.20,"Compliance with existing laws and regulations, including extensive environmental, health and safety laws, or changes in any such laws, could require material expenditures or changes in our operations.","We operate in a range of international markets and are subject to a variety of laws and regulations and we routinely incur costs in complying with these laws and regulations. For example, our operations are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations at national, international and local levels in numerous jurisdictions. New laws or regulations or changes in existing laws and regulations, particularly those health and safety or environmental protection, may conceivably require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement and could increase our cost of doing business. In addition, our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal. The nature of our industry exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production, storage, transportation, disposal and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment. In 2020, our capital expenditures for safety, health and environmental matters were €1.2 million. Compliance with environmental laws such as air emission or water protection laws generally increases the costs of manufacturing, the cost of registration/approval requirements, the costs of transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products, as well as the costs of the storage and disposal of wastes, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We may incur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs, or experience interruptions in our operations, for violations arising under these laws or permit requirements as well as in connection with subsequent orders, the withdrawal or revocation of permits and the renewal of permits. Furthermore, environmental laws are subject to change and have tended to become stricter over time. This is particularly the case with regard to changes in connection with the Industry Emissions Directive (Directive 2010/75/EU) and subsequent national legislation by EU member states transforming this directive which imposes additional and stricter obligations such as further specified basic obligations, notification obligations of the installation operator and stricter emission thresholds. Such changes in environmental laws or their interpretation, or the enactment of new environmental laws, could result in materially increased capital expenditures and compliance costs. Potential changes in laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement or alternative interpretation of existing laws and regulations in jurisdictions in which we currently operate can change the legal and regulatory environment, making compliance with all applicable laws and regulations more challenging. Various governments and intergovernmental organizations could introduce proposals for tax legislation, or adopt tax law, that may have an adverse effect on our worldwide effective tax rate, or increase our tax liability, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, or our deferred tax liabilities. Changes in laws and regulations in the future could have an adverse economic impact on us by tightening restrictions, reducing our freedom to do business, increasing our costs of doing business, or reducing our profitability. In addition, the compliance costs associated with such evolving laws and regulations may be significant. We have experienced certain limited instances of non-compliance in the past, which were addressed or are in the process of being addressed. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations can lead to civil, administrative or criminal penalties, including but not limited to fines or the revocation of permits and licenses that may be necessary for our business activities. We could also be required to pay damages or civil judgments in respect of third-party claims. In addition, the discovery of contamination arising from historical industrial operations at some of our former and present properties has exposed us, and in the future may continue to expose us, to cleanup obligations and other damages. For example, soil and groundwater contamination is known to exist or to potentially exist or to have existed at seven of our current facilities (for example, concentrations of trichloroethylene and hydrocarbon were identified at our Ruabon site in the UK), however, we have not identified regulatory drivers for further soil and groundwater investigation or remediation as some of these sites have already met the relevant remediation targets, or impacts with material costs implication. We have received indemnities from previous owners of our sites related to remediation works undertaken by them, but there can be no assurance that such indemnities will fully cover any liabilities associated with those sites. In addition, we maintain liability for the ongoing water treatment and associated measures at our former manufacturing facility located in Wallkill, NY, which was disposed in 2000. Based on the most recent monitoring conducted in October 2016, this former site recorded high levels of residual VOC concentrations. We allocate approximately $25 thousand to $30 thousand on a yearly basis, to cover any remaining soil and groundwater contamination related expenses at this former site. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we have provisions set up for environmental risks and claims in the amount of €0.3 million. There can be no assurance that these provisions will be sufficient to fund our portion of any clean-up costs. Regulatory changes in the key markets in which we will operate can also have an impact on our business. For example, new regulations may require the mandatory usage of lead-free piezo ceramics in the near future, or introduce other requirements affecting the materials which we utilize in our daily operations for the manufacturing of our products. Our success will depend on our ability to develop new technologies and to adapt to technological changes and the evolution of -43 ----- regulatory requirements, which may require major research and development activities, entailing associated research and development costs. We might not have, or might not be able to attract, the personnel necessary for such research and development activities.

In addition, we have received subsidies in the past from public bodies in Germany in relation to the development of certain R&D cooperation projects (Verbundprojekt). Governmental subsidies may be subject to certain conditions, such as the creation and maintenance of a certain number of permanent jobs until the end of a certain given period.

Our success depends significantly upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property rights and technological know-how and expertise, including, in particular, our medical products. Though we have a large number of patents, we do not possess patent protection for all of our key products such as, for example, our BIOLOX[®] ceramic hip implant products, and instead, for such products, we rely heavily on our manufacturing know-how, which is not a legally registered right, to protect our market position. We conduct research and development activities with third parties and co-develop certain intellectual property. The confidentiality and patent assignment agreements with our employees and third parties to protect the confidentiality, ownership and use of intellectual property may be breached, may not be enforceable, or may provide for joint ownership or ownership by a third party. In addition, we may not have adequate remedies for a breach by the other party, which could adversely affect our intellectual property rights. The use of our intellectual property rights or intellectual property similar to ours by others or our failure to protect such rights could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, adversely affecting our revenue. The steps we take to protect our intellectual property, including patents, proprietary technology and trademarks, may not be successful and may be challenged by third parties. For example, since 2013 we have been involved in a series of legal proceedings against C5 in Germany, the United States and France in relation to our trademarks for the distinctive pink color of our ceramic hip implant component BIOLOX[®] delta, in respect of which we incurred significant expenses and which remain ongoing. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.” In addition, Dentalpoint AG, and one of our German subsidiaries are involved in separate intellectual property litigation proceedings. If we must sue to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights, any suits or proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of company resources and management attention, and we may not prevail in such action. In addition, a failure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive position. We cannot be sure that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our patents and other proprietary rights will be adequate to protect our rights, or that any of our intellectual property will not be challenged or held invalid or unenforceable, and we may not be able to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and proprietary rights of others. We may not always be able to secure protection for, or stop infringements of, our intellectual property, and may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights. Any litigation or dispute involving the scope or enforceability of our intellectual property rights, however, as well as any allegation that we infringed upon the intellectual property rights of others, could be costly and time-consuming. In addition, if we are unable to protect our technology and intellectual property, or if key products are not subject to sufficient or any intellectual property protection, our competitors may, even temporarily, misappropriate our technologies and intellectual property rights and develop competing products, which could also have a material adverse effect on the our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects. Any of the above factors, and our inability to protect our intellectual property rights or other uses of our property (including for any of our key products that do not have patent protection) could have a material adverse effect on our competitive advantage or our ability to create innovative solutions for our customers, which will adversely affect our revenue and our relationships with our customers.

Loss of the services of, or failure to recruit, key management, scientific, technical or sales personnel could be materially detrimental to our business and financial condition. In addition, loss of employees engaged in our research and development activities may lead to a loss of know-how and research progress, with a consequent increase of costs. We face competition for scientific and technical personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other organization. Such competition is enhanced by changing population demographics, influencing the recruitment of skilled and executive personnel, and the reduction of specialized personnel in certain key functional areas, such as in the case of engineers in Germany.

As of September 30, 2021, we had approximately 3,400 FTE employees worldwide, consisting of sales, technical, manufacturing, operations, supply chain and customer service personnel, excluding approximately 350 contract labor (Leiharbeiter) workers. All of our employees in Germany and a substantial number of our employees globally are covered by labor agreements, including works agreements. Employees at our German locations have traditionally been heavily unionized and we regularly conduct, or are involved in, negotiations with the relevant employee representative bodies. For example, we recently renegotiated employee tariffs applicable at certain of our German production facilities. Any deterioration of these relationships could adversely impact our business operations. In the future, we may be subject to potential union campaigns, work stoppages, union negotiations and other potential labor disputes. While we believe that we have good relations with unions and employees generally, there can be no assurance that our relations will not deteriorate and that we will not experience labor disputes in the future. Any such strikes, conflicts, work stoppages or other industrial actions may, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Additionally, future negotiations with unions or works councils in connection with existing labor agreements may result in significant increases in our cost of labor, divert management’s attention away from operating our business, disrupt our production and sales activities, damage our reputation, adversely affect our customer relations or break down and disrupt operations. Further, we may be subject to work stoppages at our suppliers or customers that are beyond our control. There can also be no assurance that our employees will not make claims or that we will not incur work stoppages in the future. In addition, works council and collective agreements may impose obligations and restrictions on us that may adversely affect our flexibility to undertake adjustments to our workforce, restructurings, reorganizations and similar corporate actions. Any of the preceding outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. -46 -----",,,,N/A

Doing business on a worldwide basis requires us to comply with international, EU, U.S., UK and other national and local laws, and our failure to successfully comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to liabilities. These laws and regulations apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents, and may restrict our operations, trade practices, investment decisions and partnering activities. In particular, our international operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, as well as anti-corruption laws of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The FCPA and other laws prohibit us and our officers, directors, employees and agents acting on our behalf from offering, promising, authorizing or providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. As part of our business, we deal with state-owned business enterprises and, to a lesser degree, with governmental authorities, the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA. We are also subject to the jurisdiction of various governments and regulatory agencies outside of the United States, which may bring our personnel into contact with foreign officials responsible for issuing or renewing permits, licenses or approvals or for enforcing other governmental regulations. In addition, some of the international locations in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have elevated levels of corruption (for example, Brazil or China). Our employees may be tempted to win business with illegal practices, in particular corruption, certain sales incentives or violation of antitrust laws. In some of the countries in which we operate, such practices may be the custom or expected, and our competitors may undertake such practices, increasing the pressure on us and our employees. Our global operations expose us to the risk of violating, or being accused of violating, the foregoing or other anti-corruption laws. Such violations could be punishable by criminal fines, imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions and debarment from government contracts, as well as other remedial measures. Investigations of alleged violations can be very expensive and disruptive. In addition, some jurisdictions in which we operate also have anti-corruption laws in place that specifically address interactions with healthcare professionals. For example, in the U.S., the federal healthcare anti-kickback statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Violations are subject to potential criminal penalties and exclusion from participation in the programs. Claims for payment in violation of the antikickback statute are also subject to the federal False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent. Many states have analogous state laws applicable to their Medicaid programs and in some cases, private health insurance. Similarly, German criminal law (Sec. 299a and 299b of the German Criminal Code, StGB) specifically addresses corruption in the health care sector. Essentially, the acceptance or grant of a benefit (which does not necessarily have to be a direct payment of money) in exchange for a healthcare professional giving undue preference to the products of a specific producer is criminally sanctioned. Our interactions with healthcare professionals are subject to these restrictions. Any failure to comply with applicable restrictions on interactions with healthcare professionals could subject us to fines and criminal liability and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We maintain and regularly update a group-wide compliance management system, which provides a structure to identify and mitigate potential compliance risks, including certain policies and procedures. Certain of our employees have taken and may in the future, take actions in violation of our policies and procedures (or otherwise in violation of the relevant anti-corruption laws, anti-money laundering laws and sanctions regulations). There can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will be sufficient in preventing such instances or that we will not ultimately be held responsible for violations of applicable anti-corruption and sanctions regulations by our employees, directors, managers, officers, partners, agents and service providers. Violations of anti-corruption laws and sanctions regulations could lead to financial penalties being imposed on us, limits being placed on our activities, authorizations or licenses being revoked, damage to our reputation and other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Furthermore, detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management. In addition, litigation or investigations relating to alleged or suspected violations of anti-corruption laws or sanctions regulations could be costly. We cannot guarantee that our compliance and internal controls will protect us against actions taken by our officers, managers, directors, employees and agents that might be determined to be in violation of law.",,,,N/A

79,Preliminary Offerings 2022.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.1.31,Our international operations require us to comply with anti-terrorism laws and regulations and applicable trade embargoes and export controls.,"We are required to comply with trade and economic sanctions laws and other restrictions on exports and international trade. The United States and other governments and their agencies impose sanctions and embargoes on certain countries, their governments, and designated parties. For example, in the United States the economic and trade sanctions programs are principally administered and enforced by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). Currently, OFAC maintains comprehensive trade and economic sanctions against certain countries and territories such as the Crimea region of the Ukraine, Cuba, North Korea, Iran and Syria, among others. Furthermore, there are U.S. and EU targeted sanctions against Russia. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures and legal expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that our compliance policies will effectively prevent violations, particularly as the scope of certain laws may be unclear and may be subject to changing interpretations. We also manufacture certain products for the defense industry which are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of State under its International Traffic in Arms regulations (“ITAR”) as well as European and other equivalent arms control regulations. In addition, we also manufacture certain commercial or dual-use products that are subject to export restrictions under the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) administered by the U.S. Commerce Department. Sanctions, trade restrictions and export controls particularly focus on such defense and dual use related products, which are subject to the ITAR and other arms control regulations. If our defense and dual use related products were found to be directly or indirectly exported to countries which are subject to trade restrictions and sanctions, or exported to any destination without required ITAR or other export licenses, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and other costs and measures and could lose key customer relationships in the defense industry. In addition, materials and products imported into the European Union, the United States and other countries are subject to import duties. While we have implemented internal measures to comply with applicable customs regulations and to properly calculate the import duties applicable to imported products, customs authorities may disagree with our claimed tariff treatment for certain products, resulting in unexpected costs that may not have been factored into the sales price of such products and our expected margins. In addition, we cannot predict whether future domestic and foreign laws, regulations, or specific or broad trade remedy actions, or international agreements may impose additional duties or other restrictions on the importation of products from one or more of our sourcing venues. Any such changes in legislation and government policy may have a material adverse effect on our business, including the imposition of tariffs on certain materials which could increase our product costs. For example, in recent periods, the US government has announced various import tariffs on goods imported from certain trade partners, such as the European Union and China, which have resulted and may continue to result in reciprocal tariffs on goods exported from the United States to such trade partners. Trade barriers and other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements around the world have the potential to decrease demand for our products, negatively impact suppliers and adversely impact the economies in which we operate. Trade barriers and other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements could increase the cost of materials and components used in certain of our products, which could in turn increase our cost of goods sold. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international sales and manufacturing operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. Future regulations could limit the countries in which some of our products may be manufactured or sold, or could restrict our access to, or increase the cost of obtaining, products from foreign sources. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",,,,N/A

On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom withdrew its membership in the European Union and on December 24, 2020, the European Union and United Kingdom announced that they had reached the EU—UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which was implemented on December 31, 2020 and entered into force provisionally on January 1, 2021 until its entry into force on May 1, 2021. Despite the implementation of the EU—UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, there remains significant uncertainty as to how the agreement will affect relations between the United Kingdom and the European Union. For example, the Northern Ireland Protocol covering the special status of Northern Ireland remains controversial, and developments surrounding its application may affect businesses that conduct operations in both the United Kingdom and Ireland. While the EU and the United Kingdom agreed a comprehensive, zero-tariff, zero-quota -48 ----- free trade pursuant to the EU—UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the end of the transition period on that date has, among other things, led to increased customs, health and safety checks at the border, which has delayed and disrupted the movement of goods between the EU and the United Kingdom and may undermine bilateral cooperation in key policy areas, significantly disrupt trade between the United Kingdom and the EU and cause political and economic instability in other countries of the EU. Additionally, following the end of the transition period, the United Kingdom has ceased to be a member of the EU single market, which has ended the free movement of services and workers between the United Kingdom and the EU and may make it more difficult for our United Kingdom operations to do business with customers or suppliers that are based in the EU. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 3% of our revenue was generated with customers based in the United Kingdom, while our UK subsidiary employed 274 FTE personnel. The impact of the EU—UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement and the resulting effects on the political and economic future of the United Kingdom, remain uncertain. Economic instability and uncertainty in Europe, has and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A

The departure of one or more countries from the Eurozone may lead to the imposition of exchange rate control laws. The departure or risk of departure from the euro by one or more Eurozone countries could increase our exposure to changes in exchange rates and have negative effects on our existing relationships with our suppliers or customers, resulting in a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely, or the threat of such dissolution, could lead to increased market volatility, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations and for parties subject to other contractual provisions referencing the euro would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments could adversely affect our operations. Market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro and the potential re-introduction of individual currencies within the Eurozone could also have adverse consequences for us. Financial markets and the supply of credit may be negatively impacted by fears surrounding the sovereign debts and/or fiscal deficits of several countries in Europe, the possibility of further downgrading of or defaults on sovereign debt, concerns about a slowdown in growth in certain economies and uncertainties regarding the overall stability and sustainability of the euro given the economic and political circumstances in individual member states.

79,Preliminary Offerings 2022.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.1.34,"Security threats, security breaches or breakdowns in our information technology systems could result in a significant disruption of our business.","Like many other internationally operating organizations, our operations, including research, development, manufacturing, accounting, storage and delivery, are highly dependent on our information technology systems. Such systems are vulnerable to a number of threats, such as equipment damage, deficient database design, power outages, software or hardware malfunctions, malicious hacking, physical damage to vital data centers computer virus infection and a range of other hardware, software and network problems. We have experienced temporary outages in our IT systems in the past. Although it is impossible to predict the occurrence or consequences of security threats or security breaches, they could result in reduced demand for our products, data breaches, information loss, make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products to our customers or distributors or to receive raw materials from suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain. While we have countermeasures in place to prevent malfunctions and interruptions, any such malfunctions or interruptions could compromise the operational integrity of these systems and networks should our countermeasures fail in the future. There can be no assurance that the internal controls, which we have designed to restrict access to our information technology systems will prevent unauthorized access through cyber-attacks, theft and other security breaches. We also rely on systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding our customers, suppliers, employees and others. Our systems, websites, data (wherever stored), software or networks, and those of third parties (including data centers), are vulnerable to security breaches, including unauthorized access (from within our organization or by third parties), computer viruses or other malicious code and other cyber threats that could have a security impact. We may not be able to anticipate evolving techniques used to effect security breaches (which change frequently and may not be known until launched), or prevent attacks by hackers, including phishing or other cyber-attacks, or prevent breaches due to employee error or malfeasance, in a timely manner, or at all. Cyber-attacks have become far more prevalent in the past few years, leading potentially to the theft or manipulation of confidential and proprietary information or loss of access to, or destruction of, data on our or third-party systems, as well as interruptions or malfunctions in our or third parties’ operations. -49 ----- In addition, our IT systems have been in the past, or in the future may be, the target of cyber-attacks or other security breaches. We implement mitigation measures from time to time, as we identify new threats and risks. We cannot assure you that such measures will be effective or that breaches or other cyber-attacks, including industrial espionage or ransomware attacks will not occur in the future. Failure to effectively prevent, detect and remediate security breaches, including attacks on our IT infrastructure by hackers, viruses, employee error or misconduct, or other disruptions could seriously harm our operations and the operations of our customers. Such breaches may result, among other things, in unauthorized access to trade secrets, confidential business information and personal information, data losses, business interruptions, non-compliance with legal requirements, legal claims or proceedings, deterioration in customer relationships and reputational harm. In addition, due to the constantly evolving nature of security threats, we cannot predict the form and impact of any future incident, and the cost and operational expense of implementing, maintaining and enhancing protective measures to guard against increasingly complex and sophisticated cyber threats could increase significantly. While we regularly review our network security, backup and disaster recovery, enhanced training and other security measures to protect our systems and data, security measures cannot provide absolute security or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every breach or disruption on a timely basis. In addition, our information technology system needs regular upgrading to accommodate expansion of our business and maintain the efficiency of our operations. If we face a breakdown in our system, we could experience significant business and operational delays across our businesses. In particular, any breakdown in our information technology systems could result in disruptions of our research, development, manufacturing, accounting and billing processes as well as data losses. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the development of our products could be delayed. In addition, we could be subject to fines or other penalties by governmental authorities or could suffer reputational damage as a result of such breach, loss or damage.

For example, we completed the acquisition of the electro-ceramics business of Morgan Electro Ceramics in 2017 and the acquisition of Dentalpoint AG in 2021. In addition, as part of our growth strategy, we evaluate opportunities for acquiring complementary businesses that may supplement our internal growth. Our due diligence reviews of our acquisition targets may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost or potential loss contingencies with respect to a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities. We may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation and other liabilities. We also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations, applying our internal controls processes to these acquisitions or in managing strategic investments, and integrations of acquired entities could change our relations with employees, customers and suppliers. Additionally, we may not achieve the benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction, including any expected synergies, in the amount or timeframe anticipated. In the future, we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition targets, which may negatively impact our growth strategy. We also face the risk that our competitors may follow similar acquisition strategies and have greater financial resources available for investment or accept less favorable conditions that those which we are able to accept, preventing us from acquiring such targets, to the benefit of our competitors. Any acquisition or other strategic transaction that we may undertake in the future could result in the assumption of debt and contingent liabilities, as well as an increase in interest expense and amortization expense relating to goodwill or other intangible assets or a decrease in cash and cash equivalents. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, accounting requirements relating to business combinations, including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred, may cause us to experience greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses. Furthermore, we may make strategic divestitures from time to time. These divestitures may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the respective transactions.

Our funding obligations could change significantly based on the investment performance of the pension plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions for local statutory funding valuations.

A few of these plans are unfunded and the liabilities in relation to these plans will need to be satisfied as they mature from our operating reserves. In jurisdictions where the defined benefit pension plans are intended to be funded with assets in a trust or other funding vehicle, we expect that the liabilities will exceed the corresponding assets in each of the plans. Various factors, such as changes in actuarial estimates and assumptions (including in relation to life expectancy, discount rates and rate of return on assets) as well as actual return on assets, can increase the expenses and liabilities of the defined benefit pension plans. The assets and liabilities of the plans must be valued from time to time under applicable funding rules and as a result we may be required to increase the cash payments we make in relation to these defined benefit pension plans. We could also be required in some jurisdictions, as a result of the Transactions or at any time in the future, to make accelerated payments up to the full buy-out deficit in our defined benefit pension plans, which would likely be far higher than the normal ongoing funding cost of the plans. For example, we operate a defined benefit pension scheme in the United Kingdom, for the benefit of certain employees and former employees of the Group in the UK (the “UK Scheme”). According to preliminary results for the most recent actuarial valuation of the UK Scheme, as at April 1, 2020, the UK Scheme has assets of £6.9 million and technical provisions for £10.7 million, with a consequent funding shortfall of approximately £3.8 million (€4.4 million equivalent) on a technical provision basis. According to the current schedule of contributions and recovery plan, we undertook to contribute approximately £34,000 to the UK Scheme on a monthly basis, until March 31, 2027, in order to meet the shortfall and cover related administration expenses and statutory levy payments. Our cash flows may be negatively impacted to the extent that we are required to make any additional payments to any relevant defined benefit pension plans in excess of the amounts assumed in our current projections and assumptions or report higher pension plan expenses under relevant accounting rules. Moreover, in certain jurisdictions pension regulators and authorities may be granted expensive powers that may be exercised in connection with the completion of M&A transactions, including the Transactions. For example, the UK Pensions Regulator has powers to impose contributions to a UK defined benefit pension scheme, or to put in place arrangements for the financial support of the pension scheme, including, but not limited to, requirements to provide additional security in support of such scheme. The new UK Pension Schemes Act 2021, which came into force in October 2021, may also significantly impact future corporate activity of entities with a UK defined benefit pension scheme. The new legislation provides for new criminal offences targeting “risking accrued scheme benefits” and the “avoidance of employer debt”, which may be interpreted as to include ordinary corporate activity in certain circumstances. Moreover, the new legislation introduces wider powers for the UK Pensions Regulator to intervene in corporate activity (including acquisitions and internal restructurings), and new requirements to give advance notification of certain corporate activity and to provide statements to the UK Pensions Regulator, which may require the input of the pension scheme trustee, with regard to the expected impact of such activity on the pension scheme. Furthermore, we could be subject to further payment obligations, if any of our former pension plans (for Germany and the United States) were not terminated properly in the past. In such case, employees could claim that further pension entitlements accrued under these plans. In addition, there could be unknown liabilities for prior periods under such plans, that we are not aware of and thus do not show in our financial statements. Any such additional obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A

Changes in tax laws could adversely affect the Group’s tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments. The Group often relies on generally available interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. There cannot be certainty that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with the Group’s interpretation of these laws. If the Group’s tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require the Group to pay taxes that the Group currently does not collect or pay or increase the costs of the Group’s services to track and collect such taxes, which could increase the Group’s costs of operations or the Group’s effective tax rate and have a negative effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The occurrence of any of the foregoing tax risks could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. -51 ----- Due to the global nature of our business, we are subject to income and other taxes in multiple jurisdictions. Significant judgement and estimation are required in determining our calculation and provision for income, sales, value-add and other taxes, including withholding taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, we take advantage of our international network and centralize our strategic functions. In particular, we transfer and provide goods and services among the companies of the Group by adopting a tax-transfer frame model for the billing of intercompany services. There is a risk that tax authorities in individual countries assess the relevant transfer prices differently from our tax-transfer pricing model and address retroactive tax claims against one of our companies. Possible non-recognition of transfer prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we are regularly subject to tax audits by German tax authorities and tax authorities of certain other jurisdictions, which may raise claims against us for failure to comply with applicable tax laws. For example, our German subsidiaries have been subject to a general tax audit for the periods up to 2018. Final tax assessment notices were issued in 2021, and resulted in substantial changes to our tax declarations. While we appealed the assessment notices, we have recorded total provisions for tax-related disputes under other liabilities in an amount of €3.2 million as of December 31, 2020 to cover the estimated resulting risk. In addition, the tax authorities of certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate might consider activities by an entity of the Group, which is not legally domiciled in such jurisdiction, as a “permanent establishment” in such jurisdiction. This determination could result in potential adverse tax consequences, such as additional tax obligations and liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any such tax audits or reviews could differ from our tax provisions and accruals and any additional tax liabilities resulting from such final determination or any interest or any penalties or any regulatory, administrative or other sanctions relating thereto could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, certain members of the Target Group were in the past or are currently part of fiscal unities, tax groups and other tax consolidation schemes. We cannot ensure that these entities will not be held liable for unpaid taxes of the members of such tax consolidation schemes (including members outside of our Group) under statutory law or the contracts which formed or form the basis for the tax consolidation schemes. Furthermore, should such tax consolidation schemes not be accepted by the tax authorities and/or a tax court, taxes, interest and penalties may be imposed against entities of our group.

Unauthorized data disclosure could occur through cyber security breaches as a result of human error, external hacking, malware infection, malicious or accidental user activity, internal security breaches, and physical security breaches due to unauthorized personnel gaining physical access. We are exposed to the risk that data -52 ----- could be wrongfully appropriated, lost or disclosed, damaged or processed in breach of privacy or data protection laws which could lead to the imposition of fines or regulatory action, together with associated negative publicity. For example, breaches of the GDPR can result in significant fines based on percentages of our annual global turnover. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach or attack, whether actual or perceived, could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. In the past, we have been required to report a data breach to the relevant competent authority. It cannot be ruled out that we will, in the future, be subject to additional assessments or specific requests. If this were the case and we were not able to adapt promptly to the requests by the authorities and/or fail to comply with the measures required by them, we could be subject to sanctions that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected, we may be unable to anticipate these methods or promptly implement preventative measures. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers reduce our ability to attract and retain customers and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position. If a single material breach or series of less material breaches was to occur, we could face liability under data protection laws, could lose the goodwill of our customers and could have our reputation damaged, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A

Accordingly, a significant portion of our sales, expenses, assets and liabilities are in currencies other than the euro, our reporting currency, and as such our results are subject to foreign exchange translation and transaction risks. Our primary foreign exchange rate risks relate to the U.S. dollar, the Chinese yuan, the British pound sterling, the Swiss Franc, the Polish zloty and the Czech koruna. Transactional risk arises when we and our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency other than our functional currency. To the extent that we incur expenses in one currency but generate sales in another, any change in the values of those non-euro currencies relative to euro could cause our profits to decrease or our products to be less competitive than those of our competitors. To the extent that cash and receivables that are denominated in currencies other than the euro are greater or less than our liabilities denominated in such non-euro currencies, we will be exposed to the risk of fluctuations and movements in the foreign exchange markets. Where we are unable to match sales and receivables denominated in foreign currencies with expenses and liabilities denominated in the same currency, our results of operations are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. Additionally, currency risk arises in connection with the translation of the financial condition and results of operations of our international subsidiaries with non-euro reporting currencies. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent that any derivative financial instruments are not sufficient or not effective or due to a default risk of the relevant counterparty, fluctuations of local currencies could affect our financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A

Changes in weather patterns and an increased frequency, intensity and duration of extreme weather conditions could, among other things, disrupt the operation of our supply chain, increase our product costs and impact the types of products that consumers purchase. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. -53 ----- In many of the countries in which we operate, governmental bodies are increasingly enacting legislation and regulations in response to the potential impacts of climate change as well as specific levies related directly to the energy consumption (including the CO2 tax, among others), which will increase in the future.

In addition, our manufacturing processes may be affected by new regulations in response to climate change. If we are perceived to be a contributor of greenhouse gas emissions or global warming, or if we are perceived as not taking appropriate steps to mitigate our effect on the environment, this could result in damage to our image and brand, which is particularly focused on socially conscious individuals. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

The objective of the due diligence process is to identify attractive investment opportunities based on the facts and circumstances of an investment, to identify possible risks associated with that investment and to prepare a framework that may be used from the date of an acquisition to drive operational achievement and value creation. When conducting due diligence, the Sponsors typically evaluate a number of important business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental and legal issues in determining whether or not to proceed with an investment. Outside consultants, legal advisors, accountants and investment banks are involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment. Nevertheless, when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment, the Sponsors rely on resources available to them, including information provided by the Target of the investment and, in some circumstances, third-party investigations. Instances of bribery, fraud, accounting irregularities, contingent liabilities and other improper, illegal or corrupt practices can be difficult to detect, and fraud and other deceptive practices can be widespread in certain jurisdictions. There may be liabilities that the Sponsors failed, or were unable, to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations into the Target Group in connection with the Acquisition. Following the Acquisition, we may learn of additional information about the Target Group that adversely affect us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws.

The German interest barrier rules generally provide for a limitation on the deduction of net interest expenses in excess of 30% of tax adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of the interest barrier rules, all entities that are part of the same fiscal unity (Organschaft) for corporate income and trade tax purposes are treated as one single business. Any non-deductible amount exceeding the threshold of 30% is carried forward and may be, again subject to the interest barrier rules, deductible in future financial years. Any interest carryforward may be forfeited in part or in full in connection with certain measures, such as a change of the ownership structure. Upon closing of the Acquisition, certain Group companies, in particular in Germany, may forfeit their existing interest carryforwards on the Acquisition Closing Date. Furthermore, on June 20, 2016, the Council of the European Union adopted the Directive (EU) 2016/1164 (ATAD I) laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market. The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive contains five legally binding anti abuse measures, which member states are generally required to apply against common forms of aggressive tax planning since January 1, 2019. Part of the package of measures is the implementation of an interest limitation in line with German rules. The restriction of the deductibility of interest expenses for tax purposes may have adverse consequences for our financial position and results of operations. The Council of the European Union has also adopted Directive (EU) 2017/952 (ATAD II) targeting mismatches . End of June 2021, the German legislator passed the ATAD Implementation Act (Gesetz zur Umsetzung der Anti-Steuervermeidungsrichtline, “ATADUmsG”) in order to implement the respective changes into German tax law. Amongst others, the ATADUmsG has introduced provisions to counter tax shortfalls due to mismatches from the use of hybrid financial instruments or hybrid entities or due to dual tax residency and has amended the CFC rules. These new rules may result in higher taxable income and a higher tax burden for corporate income tax and trade tax purposes in the current and future tax periods. Further measures may follow as part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project. In addition, certain of our German subsidiaries have considerable tax loss carryforwards which have partially been capitalized as deferred tax assets in our Financial Statements. The use of such existing tax loss carryforwards and ongoing losses for German corporate income and trade tax purposes may be forfeited in case of a direct or indirect transfer of shares, subject to certain limited exceptions. Such restriction, applying to both corporate income and trade tax, depends on the percentage of share capital or voting rights transferred within a five year period to one acquirer or person(s) closely related to the acquirer or a group of acquirers with a common interest. Under current rules, if more than 50% of the share capital or voting rights are transferred to such an acquirer, tax loss carryforwards and current losses will be forfeited to the extent no exception from the general forfeiture rules can be applied, such as the built-in gains exemption pursuant to which tax loss carryforwards survive to the extent taxable built-in gains are available at the level of the loss-carrying entity. To the extent that the utilization of tax losses is restricted, they cannot be set off against future tax profits which would result in higher future tax burdens compared to the situation in which tax loss carryforwards can be used to lower the actual tax burden on profits. Such restriction may require a write down of the deferred tax assets in our consolidated financial statements and would negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. Furthermore, upon the creation of a fiscal unity for German corporate and trade tax purposes, any tax loss carryforwards and interest carry forwards for German corporate income and trade tax purposes of a subsidiary, which have been incurred before the creation of the fiscal unity, will be excluded from use for the duration of the fiscal unity.",,,,N/A

Based on the foregoing, investors should in particular be aware that (a) any of these reforms or pressures or any other changes to a relevant interest rate benchmark, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause a sudden or prolonged increase and/or to make it more volatile than it would otherwise be, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest, and (b) if EURIBOR, SONIA or SOFR (or any of their successors or other benchmarks) is discontinued, that may require amendments to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement or other documentation that references such rate and, in relation to any of our obligations which have not transitioned to a successor rate by the relevant date, then the rate of interest applicable to such obligations may be determined for a period by applicable fallback provisions, specified in the relevant documentation for such obligations, although such provisions, if they are dependent in part upon the provision by reference banks of offered quotations, may not operate as intended (depending on market circumstances and the availability of rates information at the relevant time).",,,,N/A

Such debt includes their obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Although the Indenture will contain restrictions on the ability of the Guarantors to incur additional debt, any additional debt incurred may be substantial and rank senior to the Note Guarantees. Upon any payment or distribution to creditors of a Guarantor under the Indenture in respect of an insolvency event, the holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor will be entitled to be paid in full from the assets of such Guarantor before any payment may be made pursuant to such Note Guarantee. Until the senior ranking debt of such Guarantor is paid in full, any distribution to which holders of the Notes would be entitled but for the subordination provisions included in the Intercreditor Agreement shall instead be made to holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor as their interests may appear. As a result, in the event of insolvency of a Guarantor under the Indenture, holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor may recover more, ratably, than the holders of the Notes, in respect of the Guarantor’s Note Guarantee. In addition, the subordination provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the Note Guarantees will provide: - customary turnover provisions by the Trustee and the holders of the Notes for the benefit of the holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor; - that if any event of default occurs and is continuing on any designated senior ranking indebtedness and the Trustee receives a notice of such default, such Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of the Notes, or pursuant to its Note Guarantee, until (among others) the earlier of the waiver or cure of such default and 179 days after the date on which the applicable payment blockage notice is received; and - that the holders of the Notes and the Trustee are prohibited, without the prior consent of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors, from taking any enforcement action in relation to such guarantee, except in certain circumstances. The Indenture will also provide that, except under very limited circumstances, only the Trustee will have standing to bring an enforcement action in respect of the Notes and the Note Guarantees. Moreover, the Intercreditor Agreement and the -60 ----- Indenture will restrict the rights of holders of the Notes to initiate insolvency proceedings or take legal actions against each of the Guarantors under the Indenture and by accepting any Note each such holder will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions.

In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or other winding up, our assets that secure debt ranking senior or equal in right of payment to the Notes will be available to pay obligations on the Notes on a pro rata basis with debt ranking equal in right of payment to the Notes only after the senior secured debt has been repaid in full from these assets. There may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the Notes then outstanding. The Indenture will not prohibit us from incurring additional secured debt, nor will it prohibit any of our subsidiaries from incurring additional liabilities. Generally, claims of creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any) of non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to their respective parent entity or the creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors. Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary of the Issuer becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction: - the creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors (including the holders of the Notes) will have no right to proceed against the assets of such non-Guarantor subsidiary; and - creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any) will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder (as applicable), will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary. As such, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and any preferred stockholders (if any) of the non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer.

See “Description of the Notes—Security.” In addition, a portion of the Collateral, the Shared Collateral, will also secure the Senior Secured Credit Facilities on a first-priority basis, and the Notes on a junior-priority basis, and may secure additional debt ranking senior to or pari passu with the Notes and the Note Guarantees. Although the pledge over the shares of the Issuer will secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees on a first-priority basis and will not secure the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, such pledge may secure additional debt ranking pari passu with the Notes, to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders may therefore be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by the Collateral or a reduction of the value of the Collateral securing the Notes. In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral will be applied in repayment of any Super Senior Liabilities (to the extent the Designation Date has occurred), followed by (or unless the Designation Date has not occurred) any lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, among others, before repayment of the Notes and Note Guarantees. To the extent the claims of the holders of the Notes exceed the value of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees, those claims will generally rank equally with the claims of the holders of all other existing and future senior debt ranking pari passu with the Notes and the Note Guarantees. As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as Collateral is less than the value of the claims of the holders of the Notes, those claims may not be satisfied in full. In addition, not all of our assets will secure the Notes, and the Indenture will allow the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure certain types of debt permitted to be incurred under the Indenture (which may be structurally senior to the Notes and the Note Guarantees) with the property and assets of the restricted subsidiaries that do not secure the Notes. The value of such assets and property could be significant. If an event of default occurs and the obligations under the Notes are accelerated, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of unsecured debt of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property or assets that is excluded from the Collateral securing the Notes.",,,,N/A

In the event of an enforcement of the pledges in respect of the Notes, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the pledges may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes including due to the reasons described in the preceding sentence. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers. The Collateral that is pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of such Collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, such as Germany, include restrictions on persons who may hold certain of our licenses, authorizations and consents that are necessary to operate our business. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Transaction Security Documents, enforcement of the Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets will not secure the Notes and it is possible that the value of the Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by the Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, which may leave little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. The Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the Transaction Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations -62 ----- under the Notes.

There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a security document will be validly secured. In certain jurisdictions, including Germany, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the relevant Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors owed to holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (“Principal Obligations”). All or part of the pledges and other security interests in such jurisdictions will be granted to the Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations.

The Issuer is organized under the laws of Germany and the entities expected to provide Notes Guarantees are organized under the laws of Germany and the United States. With respect to the Issuer and any Guarantor organized under the laws of a member state of the European Union, there is a rebuttable presumption that the “centre of main interest” as defined in the Council of the European Union Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings (recast) is the jurisdiction where the registered office is situated.

Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer, the enforceability of a Note Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the Security Interests. In certain circumstances the court may also void the Security Interest or the Note Guarantee if the company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Note Guarantee or the Security Interests provided by such security provider; - direct that the Issuer and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Note Guarantee or any Security Interest to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to you. If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Note Guarantee or Security Interest is found to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor or security provider under its Note Guarantee or the Security Interests will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors and security providers under the Transaction Security Documents will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire Note Guarantee or Security Interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Note Guarantee or created any Security Interest if: - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute; or - its liabilities exceed the liquidation value of its assets, unless it has a positive going concern prognosis. Although we believe that both the Issuer and the Guarantors are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or security provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Note Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date its Note Guarantee was issued or the Security Interests were created, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

Enforcement of the obligations under a Note Guarantee against, and/or any Collateral provided by, as applicable, any such Guarantor or providers of collateral will be subject to certain defenses available to the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or similar laws as well as regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally, particularly by limiting the amounts recoverable under the Note Guarantees and Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security provider under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Note Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Note Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or such Note Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors or managers of such subsidiary Guarantor or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. -66 ----- The Note Guarantees and/or security interests granted by a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit _beschränkter Haftung, “GmbH”) or a partnership with a GmbH as liable partner (i.e., a “GmbH & Co. KG”) for the purpose_ of guaranteeing or securing liabilities of its direct or indirect shareholders or a subsidiary of such shareholders (excluding direct or indirect subsidiaries of such GmbH) are considered to constitute a benefit for such shareholder and therefore are subject to certain capital maintenance and liquidity maintenance rules. Therefore, any Note Guarantees and/or security interests provided by a GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG will be subject to certain contractual limitations (so called “limitation language”) contained in the Indenture (or any other document under which any Note Guarantee is granted) and that are or will be contained in the Transaction Security Documents, respectively, designed to ensure compliance with applicable capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or any other general statutory laws. Certain of the Collateral granted by a Guarantor incorporated as a German GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG will be subject to “limitation language.” Any guarantee and/or security interest granted by a GmbH or any other entity incorporated/established under the laws of Germany (including Bidco) may be held invalid pursuant to Section 138 BGB and would therefore not be enforceable if, at the time of the creation or enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security interest, among others, the third party creditor and the affiliate have acted in fraudulent conveyance (kollusives Zusammenwirken) to the detriment of the GmbH or other third party creditors of the GmbH. These principles apply mutatis mutandis to a GmbH & Co. KG. As a result, the Guarantor’s or security provider’s liability under its Note Guarantee or Collateral could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law and contractual enforcement restrictions applicable to it. This could lead to a situation in which such Note Guarantee or Collateral cannot be enforced at all. It is possible that a Guarantor or security provider, or any of their creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s Note Guarantee or the security provider’s Collateral on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Note Guarantee or Collateral should be limited or voided. To the extent that any limitations on the relevant Note Guarantees or Collateral apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or security provider, including trade payables of such Guarantor or security provider. Future Note Guarantees and Collateral may be subject to similar limitations.

After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and if investors are not participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture.

Although the Non-U.S. Obligors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors, managers and executive officers of Non-U.S. Obligors.

Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes upon a change of control would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.

The occurrence of any one of a number of events outside our control such as terrorist attacks (including cyberattacks), hurricanes, fires, ash clouds, pandemics, the outbreak or escalation of hostilities among nations (including the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts), natural disasters, air traffic control disruptions, including strikes by controllers, accidents and actions by aviation authorities against airlines or airplane manufacturers, may lead to a reduction in the number of air travelers on a global, regional or local level. Further, growth may be inhibited due to increases in oil prices, which lead to higher fuel surcharges and ticket prices and restrict customers’ budgets by increasing the general cost of living. Similarly, new regulations and taxes, such as a surcharge to compensate for the carbon emissions caused by air travel that has been proposed or already introduced in a number of countries, could have a similar effect. Any future event of a similar nature, even if not directly affecting the airline industry, may lead to a significant decrease in the number of air travelers. Further, any disruption to or suspension of services provided by airlines, as a result of financial difficulties, labor disputes or shortages, construction work, increased security or otherwise, could negatively affect the number of air passengers. Such a reduction in airline passenger numbers would result in a decrease in our sales and may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The events that could cause a decrease in airline passenger traffic could also have a similar effect on our operations that serve passengers using other forms of travel, such as shops and restaurants on motorways, cruise lines, ferries, at seaports, train stations, downtown tourist locations and others, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Since our success is dependent on consumer spending, our business may be adversely affected by factors such as an economic downturn in these economies that could cause a rise in unemployment, a decline in consumer confidence, changes in exchange rates, an increase in interest rates, inflation, deflation, direct or indirect taxes and consumer debt levels. In particular, our EMEA and North America segments represented 51% and 31%, respectively, of our total sales in 2023. Economic downturns in these economies, specifically, or in the other countries in which we operate, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A
107,Preliminary Offerings 2024.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,1.1.3,The market to obtain concessions continues to be highly competitive.,"Our business is highly dependent upon concessions and sub-concessions granted by airport, motorway and railway authorities, and other travel facilities such as cruise lines. We compete with other travel retailers and F&B service providers at global, regional and local levels in obtaining and renewing or extending these concessions. Some of our competitors have strong financial support or solid relationships with concession grantors, which benefit those competitors in competing for concessions. There is no guarantee that we will be able to win new concessions, ----- renew our existing concessions or that, if we do renew a concession, it will be on similar commercial and other terms. In addition, failure to obtain or renew a concession necessarily means that we will not be able to enter or continue operating in the market during the contract term represented by such concession. If we were to fail to renew major concessions or fail to obtain further concessions, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result of competition among travel retailers to obtain or maintain retail concessions, airport authorities and other landlords have increasingly been able to demand more favorable concession terms. In addition to shorter terms, concession agreements generally provide for minimum annual guarantee (“MAG”) payments, which are a minimum fee payable to the airport operator regardless of the amount of sales at the concession. Currently, the majority of our concessions provide for a MAG that is either a fixed amount or an amount that is variable based upon the number of travelers using the airport or other location, retail space used, estimated sales, past results or other metrics. If passenger numbers are lower than expected or if there is a decline in the sales per passenger at these facilities, this may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.",,,,N/A

While our concessions had an average maturity of more than seven years as of December 31, 2023, they may be unilaterally terminated or modified prior to the end of the original expiration date upon expropriation or annulment by the respective authorities or forfeiture by us. Forfeiture may be declared by the authorities if the concessionaire fails to fulfill the terms and conditions set forth in the concession agreement as well as applicable legal and regulatory obligations. Annulment may be declared by the authorities or by courts if the act granting the concession or its terms do not comply with the appropriate legal requirements, such as procurement, antitrust or similar regulations. The concessions may also be terminated early by airport and motorway authorities or landlords in certain circumstances including, among others: - assignment, transfer or sub-lease by us to third parties, in whole or in part, of the rights or obligations provided for in the relevant agreement without the prior approval of the authority or grantor; - a change of control; - failure by us to comply with any of the material provisions of the concession agreement; - use by us of the concession area for any purpose other than the object of the agreement; - entry by us into an agreement with a third party with respect to the concession area or services to be explored without the applicable airport or motorway authorities’ prior approval; - making of any modification to the facilities without the applicable airport or motorway authorities’ prior approval; - default by us on the payment of the fees for a period provided for in the relevant agreement; - failure by us to provide services with an adequate quality level, comply with service-level agreements or obtain the necessary equipment for the satisfactory rendering of such services; - becoming a sanctioned party under OFAC or similar sanction regulations; or - reasons of public interest.",,,,N/A
107,Preliminary Offerings 2024.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,1.1.5,We may not be able to execute our growth strategy effectively or to integrate successfully any new concessions or future acquisitions into our business.,"Our principal strategy is to continue to grow by enhancing and expanding our existing facilities and by seeking new concessions through tenders or private negotiations or through acquisition opportunities. Our Destination 2027 ----- strategy aims to achieve further growth by addressing evolving consumer trends, driving spend per passenger and responding to the changing needs of airports. In this regard, our future growth will depend upon a number of factors, some of which may not be within our control, such as the timing of any concession or acquisition opportunity, our ability to identify any such opportunities, structure a competitive proposal, obtain required financing or consummate an offer. As a result, we cannot assure you that this strategy will be successful. In addition, we may encounter difficulties integrating expanded or new concessions or any acquisitions into our existing operations. For example, concessions often contain covenants that limit the ability to conduct our operations, including the range of products that may be offered for sale and the pricing policies that are applied. The need to comply with such covenants could prevent us from, among other things, adapting the range of products offered to accommodate changing consumer preferences, or integrating and combining new products and concessions that have been obtained through acquisitions. As a result, such expansions, new concessions or acquisitions may not achieve anticipated revenue and earnings growth or synergies and cost savings. Delays in the startup of new projects and the refurbishment of shops and restaurants also affect our business. A failure to execute our growth strategy successfully may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A

In particular, Autogrill manages a large portfolio of brands and services across a variety of countries, including products and services in the travel F&B sector that we have not traditionally offered. As a result of the combination, we may face various risks relating to organizational integration; heightened operational, employee management and regulatory risks; liability and reputational harm related to food safety risks; challenges in anticipating consumer trends and maintaining our competitive position throughout all the markets in which we operate; and exposure to litigation or intellectual property infringement claims related to proprietary brands and third-party relationships that we assumed through the business combination. If any of the risks associated with the newly combined Company materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There are integration costs and non-recurring transaction costs associated with the combination, including costs associated with combining our operations and achieving the synergies we expect to obtain, and such costs have been, and may continue to be, significant.

The measures taken to address public health crises, such as restrictions on domestic and international travel as well as the unwillingness of a large part of the population to travel given the health risks associated with such crises, have had, and may again have, a significant negative impact on the travel industry. As a result, all aspects of our business have been, and may again be, materially negatively impacted. For example, due to the unprecedented level of disruption of domestic and international travel resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including travel restrictions adopted by governments worldwide and operational shutdowns of airports, cruise lines and other travel channels, passenger numbers at the facilities where we operate were dramatically reduced and turnover decreased by 71.1% in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the prior year. ----- We are also not able to predict whether health crises will result in permanent changes to travelers’ behavior, with such potential changes including a permanent reduction in business travel as a result of increased usage of “virtual” and “teleconferencing” products and more broadly a general reluctance by consumers to travel or purchase retail and F&B products in travel locations, each of which could have a material impact on our business.

We have a significant number of concessions that have local partners, mainly in China, the Middle East, Brazil, Africa, Eastern Europe and the United States. Our local partners maintain ownership interests in the relevant operating subsidiary, some of which operate major concessions. Our participation in each of these operating subsidiaries differs from market to market. Our ability to withdraw funds, including dividends, from our participation in, and to exercise management control over, such subsidiaries may depend upon the consent of our local partners.

In 2023, duty free products accounted for 37% of our net sales. Governmental authorities in various countries in which we operate may alter or eliminate the duty-free status of certain products or otherwise change importation or tax laws. Further, sales and excise taxes on products sold at traditional retail locations may be lowered in the future, partly removing our competitive advantage with respect to duty-free product pricing. If we lose the ability to sell duty-free products in any of our major duty-free markets or if we lose market share to traditional retailers as a result of a reduction in sales and excise taxes, our revenues may decrease significantly and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, we are subject to tax audits and proceedings from time to time in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes and penalties. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits and proceedings in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provisions.

Actions filed against us from time to time include commercial, tort, intellectual property, customer, employment, labor, tax, administrative, customs, antidiscrimination and other claims. The outcome of such legal proceedings is uncertain, and our involvement may require significant resources, time and effort, and may divert the attention of our management. While the outcome of any legal proceedings and the potential damages and other losses we may incur arising out of any current or future legal proceedings are inherently difficult to predict, we may have to pay substantial damages, settlement costs and, in turn, increased insurance premiums if a claim is resolved against us. Even if a claim is not resolved against us, we may incur significant legal fees, which we may not recoup. Deciding whether or not to provide for a loss in connection with such legal proceedings requires us to make determinations about various factual and legal matters beyond our control. Legal proceedings for which we have recognized insufficient provisions or any future related claims for which we have not recognized any provisions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be impacted by litigation trends, including class action lawsuits involving consumers, shareholders and employees, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A

In addition, we are required to obtain and maintain licenses from various jurisdictions in order to operate certain aspects of our business, such as licenses for food service or the sale of alcoholic beverages in our restaurants. We are routinely subject to new or modified laws, regulations and licensing requirements, and compliance with new laws and requirements may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that reduce our profitability. A failure to obtain or maintain licenses could also delay or prevent us from meeting customer demand and adversely affect our operating performance.

Our success depends in part on our ability to effectively predict and respond to quickly changing consumer demands and preferences of customers from over 150 nationalities, many of which have different purchasing and dining behaviors, and to translate market trends into appropriate merchandise listings. Additionally, due to our limited sales space relative to other retailers, the selection of salable merchandise is an important factor in revenue generation. We cannot assure you that our product orders will match actual demand.

Our success also depends on our ability to identify changing preferences and behaviors, distinguish between short-term trends and long-term changes in such preferences and behaviors, and continue to develop and offer restaurant concepts and food that appeal to travelers in the various markets in which we operate. Consumer preference and behavior changes include dietary trends, attention to different nutritional aspects of food and beverages, preferences for certain F&B restaurant concepts and brands, concerns regarding the health effects of certain foods and beverages, attention to sourcing practices relating to ingredients, animal welfare concerns and environmental concerns regarding packaging, among others. These changes in travelers’ preferences and eating habits can occur rapidly, which requires us to adapt with similar speed.

If any traveler becomes, or is under the belief that they have become, ill due to a food safety issue, we may temporarily close some restaurant locations, which would adversely impact our results of operations. Food safety issues may be caused by a variety of factors, many of which are out of our control. For example, incidents may occur when travelers enter our restaurants while ill and contaminate ingredients, surfaces or other individuals. We also cannot guarantee that food items will be properly maintained throughout the supply chain. Our third-party suppliers may not fully comply with our or their own food safety programs, and these third parties could cause food-borne illness incidents. In addition, any food safety issue arising from a supplier would likely affect multiple restaurants rather than a single restaurant. Our restaurants and facilities are subject to review and examination by governmental authorities, which may result in temporary or permanent closures. Such closures may negatively impact our results and damage our reputation. Food items produced at our third-party suppliers’ facilities are vulnerable to spoilage, contamination and food safety issues. While we require our third-party suppliers to comply with our food safety standards, we do not have control over their manufacturing and packaging processes. New scientific discoveries regarding food safety and food manufacturing may bring additional risks and latent liability.

A significant increase in minimum wage requirements or overtime pay in the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse impact on our operating costs and may require us to reduce our margins or expend additional resources to mitigate such increases.

Business climates in these markets expose us to greater political, economic, legal and social uncertainty than markets with more developed institutional structures. The risk of loss resulting from changes in law, economic disruptions, social upheaval, currency devaluations, hyperinflation, corruption and other ----- factors may be substantial. For example, these factors could decrease tourism to countries where we operate, some of which are holiday destinations. We are also exposed to risks arising from interruptions of operations due to political or social instability, regional conflicts and the establishment or enforcement of foreign exchange restrictions, which could effectively prevent us from repatriating profits, liquidating assets or withdrawing funds from one or more of these markets. For example, our business could be affected by further instability in the Middle East, including as a result of the IsraelHamas conflict, and prolonged or recurring currency devaluations in Brazil and Argentina. Similarly, the RussiaUkraine war has had a negative impact on our operations due to the decrease in international air travel to and from Russia, international sanctions regimes with respect to Russia and the suspension of our operations in Ukraine. Further, countries like China have imposed severe travel restrictions in recent years, which have negatively affected our revenue from Chinese tourists both within China and in our other markets. Furthermore, changes in regulations or enforcement mechanisms could substantially reduce or eliminate any turnover or profits derived from operations in these countries and could reduce significantly the value of assets related to such operations. Another aspect of certain emerging markets is the potential inadequacy of the legal system and law enforcement mechanism, which leaves us exposed to the possibility of considerable loss as a result of abusive practices by competitors, parties with which we contract or others. For example, we participate in a joint venture with Alibaba in China, which subjects us to associated legal, political, social and regulatory risks.

The adoption of new climate-related legislation and regulatory requirements may lead to carbon taxation, increases in energy prices, and additional supply chain and distribution costs. Any significant increase in consumer prices to cover such costs may lead to a decrease in passenger traffic on flights, cruise ships and other means of transportation, which could have a negative impact on our operations. Consumer preference is increasingly impacted by the awareness of climate change, and customers are more frequently demanding responsibly sourced and manufactured products that present lower environmental footprints. Heightened ecological awareness may result in decreased demand for plastics and packaging materials, including single-use and non-recyclable plastic products and packaging. Further, there is growing recognition of the effects that travel has on climate change, which may reduce passenger traffic and cause consumers to choose alternatives to the travel channels in which we operate. Any such changes in consumer preferences may require us to adapt our operations, which could result in increased costs and reduced profitability. The acute and chronic physical effects of climate change, such as severe weather events, rising sea levels and excessive heat, could potentially lead to asset damage and restoration costs, disruptions in our supply chain and the relocation of our operations, among other things. The likelihood of any acute or chronic physical effects is uncertain, and we are not able to accurately predict the materiality of any potential losses or costs associated with the physical effects of climate change at this time.",,,,N/A

Our principal translation currency exposures are to the euro and the USD. Changes in the relevant exchange rates between the Swiss franc and the other currencies to which we are exposed, which have been volatile recently, have affected and will continue to affect the value of our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Swiss franc, our costs and our turnover, each of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

We are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security, the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (“OFAC”), and various non-U.S. government entities, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons, customs requirements, currency exchange regulations and transfer pricing regulations. We refer to these laws and regulations as “Trade Control laws.” We have instituted policies, procedures and ongoing training of certain employees with regard to business ethics and compliance requirements, designed to ensure that we and our employees comply with the anti-corruption laws and Trade Control laws. However, we cannot assure you that our efforts have been and will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws or other legal requirements. In particular, our ongoing operations in Russia are subject to a variety of sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries, and while we intend to maintain full compliance with all applicable Trade Control laws, we may face reputational or legal consequences (including sanctions by OFAC) that stem from our business in Russia.

In particular, efforts to combat base erosion and profit shifting (“BEPS”) have led to the development of various measures that have already been introduced or are expected to be introduced in the countries in which we operate. On December 20, 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) published the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy—Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two): Inclusive Framework on BEPS (the “Pillar II Initiative”). The Pillar II Initiative for a coordinated system of taxation consists of an income inclusion rule, an undertaxed profits rule and a qualified domestic minimum top-up tax. The system is intended to ensure that large multinational companies, such as Avolta, pay a minimum level of tax on the income attributable to each of the jurisdictions in which they operate. The European Commission published a legislative proposal to implement the Pillar II Initiative in all 27 member states of the European Union, which was formally adopted by the Council of the European Union on December 15, 2022.

By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may effectively have no obligations under its Guarantee. ----- Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and similar laws, a court could subordinate or void any Guarantee if it found that: - the relevant Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or other person or to prefer one creditor over another or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor or other person was insolvent when it issued the Guarantee; - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the Guarantee and the Guarantor; - the Guarantor was insolvent, subsequently became insolvent or was rendered insolvent because of the Guarantee or security; - the Guarantor was undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the Guarantee; - the Guarantor intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay at maturity; - the Guarantee was not in the best interests or for the benefit of the Guarantor; or - the amount paid was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. The measure of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance and similar laws varies depending on the law applied. Generally, however, a Guarantor would be considered insolvent if it could not pay its obligations as they became due. In such circumstances, if a court voided such Guarantee, or held it unenforceable, noteholders would cease to have any claim in respect of the Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and the remaining Guarantors. If a court decides a Guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance and voids the Guarantee, or holds it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and any remaining Guarantors.",,,,N/A

The rights of holders of the Notes under the Guarantees will thus be subject to the laws of different jurisdictions, and it may be difficult to enforce such rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors. In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administration and other laws of our jurisdiction of organization and the jurisdiction of organization of the Guarantors may be materially different from, or in conflict with, one another, including creditor’s rights, priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceeding.

Consequently, we are specifically exposed to loss or damage resulting from actual or perceived issues regarding the safety or quality of the food we propose. Any inappropriate preparation methods, production systems or behavior could harm the quality of the food services we provide. Claims of illness or injury relating to contaminated, spoiled, mislabeled or adulterated food may require costly measures to investigate and remediate, such as withdrawing products from sale or destroying supplies and inventory that are unfit for consumption. Our catering activities rely on strict adherence by employees to standards for food handling and catering operations. Claims related to food quality or food handling are common in the contract catering industry and may arise at any time. If we were to be found negligent in terms of food safety, we could be exposed to significant liability, which could have an adverse impact on our operating performance. Even if such claims are without merit, any negative publicity concerning food safety could damage our reputation and negatively affect our sales. Our catering activities also expose us to the risks inherent to the food industry in general, such as the risk of widespread contamination of foodstuffs, problems related to product traceability, nutritional concerns and other health-related issues. From time to time, food suppliers are forced to recall products and as a result the Group may have to remove certain products from its inventory and source inventory from other providers. Such events can be highly disruptive to our business.

In order to win a contract, we must be able to demonstrate our value proposition effectively. We therefore devote significant time and effort to preparing the bid or proposal for a competitive bidding process. A detailed analysis is carried out on the costs incurred during this phase, which are expensed if the bid is unsuccessful. Even if a bid is successful, we may not be able to fully evaluate the contract until operations actually begin. If any undertakings written into the service offering and/or the service contract signed with the client are not respected, this may lead to the loss of the contract if the client considers that it is not getting sufficient value added from the service provided. In addition, we may have to terminate a contract that is unprofitable. However, our ability to terminate our contracts may be limited. For example, our contract catering and services contracts with public entities are difficult to terminate because of certain contractual provisions that are required by law to be included in public sector contracts. If we underestimate the cost of providing our services under a particular contract and we are unable to terminate or renegotiate the contract, we could incur significant losses that could have an adverse effect on our business. As the parameters used for assessing the profitability of a future contract derive from the client’s specifications, these parameters cannot always be checked and, in addition, are subject to change Our competitors range from local small and medium-sized enterprises to multinational corporations. If our clients do not perceive the quality and cost value of our services, or if there is insufficient demand for new services, this could have an adverse effect on our business and earnings.

Contracts represent volatile assets as there are a range of reasons why they can be lost or terminated including competition, client insourcing, site closures. We conduct business with our contract catering and services clients under contracts that either have a stated term or may be terminated with advance notice. Contracts may be terminated, or not renewed, if one of our competitors offers the same service for a lower price or in the event of changes in market trends. Our business depends on our ability to renew contracts and win new contracts under favorable financial conditions. We cannot predict whether a client will choose to cancel a contract or allow it to lapse. Moreover, even if contracts are renewed, their new terms may be less advantageous than previously or they may require the Group to incur significant capital expenditure. Clients may also decide to insource the contract catering and/or services previously outsourced to the Group or to relocate their sites or change their strategy. The loss of a large contract or the loss of multiple contracts simultaneously could have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial and operating performance.

Some contracts may contain clauses that could incur our liability or result in us bearing risks that were poorly understood at the outset, which could have an adverse impact on its financial and operating performance. We are reliant on clients' ability to pay for our services.

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from contracts with public sector entities. Business generated by public sector clients may be affected by political and administrative decisions regarding levels of public spending, particularly in light of the current attention in certain countries in which we operate to reducing national and local government budget deficits. We also have to respect certain legal requirements (for example, if we fail to pay our payroll taxes, we can be excluded from participating in tenders for public contracts). We have to produce various administrative documents (directors’ criminal record checks and various types of certifications) and we have to demonstrate compliance with all applicable legal obligations. We must also be vigilant to comply with anti-bribery and related laws and regulations and could incur liability if our policies and procedures do not detect any illegal acts. If we do not comply with the procedural regulations applicable to tenders for public contracts, our bid may be rejected or a successful bid could be challenged by the authorities or an unsuccessful competitor and the allocation of the contract to the Group canceled. This type of challenge to the allocation of a public contract can also happen when the Group has already begun work on the contract concerned.

124,Final Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.2,Causes / Risks** **Consequences** **Impacts,1.2.13,We are exposed to certain risks due to the international scope of our operations and our decentralized management structure.,"We seek to create value by leveraging the synergies and the commercial strength of a multinational group. In order to do so, we must structure our organization and operations appropriately while respecting the various tax laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which are generally complex. Additionally, because tax laws may not provide clear-cut or definitive doctrines, the tax regime applied to our operations and intragroup transactions or reorganizations is sometimes based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations. We cannot guarantee that such interpretations will not be challenged by the relevant tax authorities, which may adversely affect our financial and operating performance. Tax laws and regulations are subject to change, and new laws and regulations may make it difficult for us to restructure our operations in a tax-efficient manner. More generally, any failure to comply with the tax laws or regulations of the countries in which we operate may result in reassessments, late payment interest, fines or other penalties. The services the Group provides to its clients are subject to value added tax, sales taxes or other similar taxes. Tax rates may increase at any time, and any such increase could affect the Group's business and the demand for its services. This in turn could reduce our operating profit, negatively affecting our operating performance. Our international operating presence exposes it to the risk of being unaware of changes in local regulations and/or accounting rules (local GAAP and IFRS).

If there is an indication of impairment, an impairment loss is recognized, which directly impacts the financial statements. Impairment may result from a deterioration in the Group’s performance, a decline in expected future cash flows, a deterioration in market conditions, or adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations. The amount of any goodwill impairment losses recognized is expensed immediately in the income statement and may not be subsequently reversed. For example, the Group recognized a €63.7 million goodwill impairment loss in its financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2018. Any future impairment of goodwill would result in material reductions of the Group’s net profit and equity under IFRS. Furthermore, the Group may record deferred tax assets on its balance sheet, reflecting future tax savings resulting from differences between the tax and accounting values of assets and liabilities or in respect of the tax loss carryforwards of its subsidiaries. Recovery of these assets in future years depends on tax laws and regulations, the outcome of potential tax audits, and the future results of the subsidiaries concerned. Any reduced ability to recover these assets due to changes in laws and regulations, potential tax reassessments, or lower than expected profits could negatively impact the Group's financial and operating performance. Over time, the contract catering market has become very capital expenditure intensive (outlay on property, plant and equipment at production sites and points of sale). Consequently, our property, plant and equipment represent a significant weighting in our financial statements, which exposes us to the risks of obsolescence, physical deterioration of equipment, client restructuring or insolvency, loss of a major contract, or theft. As the end-consumer (the guest) 33 ----- is very often not the client with which we have a contractual relationship, we may be exposed to the risk of non-payment (disputes, late payments etc.).

Lastly, the increase in using of Internet of Things devices to operate the business could also lead to loss, theft or leaks of sensitive information. In addition, targeted cyber-attacks, fraud and industrial espionage are becoming increasingly sophisticated. These risks need to be taken into account in a range of everyday personal behavior, such as using laptop computers, having sensitive conversations in public places, using the “reply all” function for emails and keeping confidential documents in public areas such as meeting rooms and digital print rooms.

Understanding the expectations of our people (salaries, career development opportunities etc.) and ensuring that these are met are essential to our success. For example, 34 ----- if employees feel that the salaries and career development paths offered by the Group are inadequate this could lead to high staff turnover. The success of the Group’s operations depends on the skills, experience, efforts and policies of its executives and the continued active participation of a relatively small group of senior management personnel. If the services of all or some of these executives were to be lost, this could harm our operations, impair efforts to expand our business, damage our image and negatively impact our share price. If one or more key executives were to leave the Group, a replacement would have to appointed with the necessary qualifications to carry out the Group’s strategy, and if such a replacement were not available within the Group, he or she would have to be hired externally. Because competition for skilled employees is intense, and the process of finding qualified individuals can be lengthy and expensive, the loss of the services of key executives and employees could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business and our financial and operating performance. We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to retain such key executives and employees. We rely on skilled and experienced managerial personnel at each level of the organization to ensure that our operations are carried out in an effective, cost-efficient manner. Site managers are the first point of contact with clients and are key to maintaining good client relations.

In relation to such implementation, (i) (x) the provisions of Article 212 bis and 223 B bis of the French Tax Code (i.e., the former 25% general limitation of deductibility of financial expenses (“rabot fiscal”)) and (y) Article 209-IX of the French Tax Code (the “Amendement Carrez” limitation) have been repealed and (ii) the provisions of Article 212-II of the French Tax Code (i.e., existing thin-capitalization rules) have been amended, as developed in more detail below. 38 ----- The other rules limiting interest deductibility generally remain unchanged, in particular the rules relating to the maximum deductible tax rate for interest paid to direct minority shareholders or to related parties in the sense of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code (Articles 39-1-3 and 212-I-(a) of the French Tax Code). Under Article 39-1-3° of the French Tax Code, interest paid by an entity to its direct shareholders who are not related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code are tax deductible only up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate referred to in Article 39-1-3° of the French Tax Code (i.e., the annual average of the average effective floating rates on bank loans to companies with an initial maturity exceeding two years). Under Article 212 I-(a) of the French Tax Code, interest incurred on loans granted by related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code is deductible up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate referred to in Article 39-1-3° of the French Tax Code or, if higher, up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate that the borrowing entity could have obtained from independent financial credit institutions in similar circumstances. Pursuant to Article 212 bis of the French Tax Code, the deductibility of net financial expenses incurred by an entity in respect of a given fiscal year is limited to the higher of (i) €3 million and (ii) 30% of its adjusted EBITDA in the same fiscal year (corresponding to its taxable income before offset of carry forward tax losses and without taking into consideration net financial expenses and, to some extent, depreciation, provisions and capital gains/losses) generated by such entity (the “30% Limitation”). Such limitation applies to both related-party and third-party financings regardless of the purpose of these financings, subject to certain limited exceptions. Furthermore, for entities being part of a group that files eligible consolidated financial statements, a safeguard clause has been implemented in order to partially exempt companies that are able to demonstrate that the ratio of their equity over their total assets is equal to or higher than the same ratio computed at the level of the accounting consolidated group to which they belong. In this specific case, net financial expenses exceeding the 30% Limitation are deductible up to 75% of their amount. French thin-capitalization rules apply in respect of loans granted by related parties. Where the amount of the related party debt of a company exceeds a ratio equal to 1.5 time the company’s equity, the deduction of net financial expenses borne by such entity is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 30% of its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €3 million, multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by nonrelated parties (directly or indirectly) within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code increased by 1.5 time the company’s equity (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said year. The balance of net financial expenses is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 10% of its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €1 million multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by related parties (directly or indirectly) within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code exceeding 1.5 time the company’s own funds (assessed either at the beginning or on the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said fiscal year. However, the interest deductibility limitation provided for by these amended thin-capitalization rules does not apply if the borrowing company demonstrates that the overall debt-to-equity ratio of the group, as determined under accounting consolidation rules, to which it belongs is higher than or equal to its own debt-toequity ratio. Financial expenses that are disallowed pursuant to the 30% Limitation can be carried forward indefinitely and deducted in the future under the same conditions. On the other hand, the 39 ----- portion of financial expenses which tax deduction is disallowed as a result of the application of the €1 million threshold or 10% limitation is only eligible for carry-forward for one-third of its amount. The unused interest deduction capacity of a current fiscal year may also be used over the five following fiscal years, but only against financial expenses incurred in respect of those fiscal years, it being noted that this measure is not available to thinly capitalized entities. Specific rules apply to companies that belong to French tax consolidated groups, i.e., mainly (i) the 30% Limitation is computed on the basis of the consolidated adjusted EBITDA generated by such companies and (ii) the 1.5 debt-to-own funds ratio is analyzed (x) on a consolidated basis pursuant to French accounting rules applying for purposes of establishing consolidated financial statements and (y) in respect of loans granted by related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code which do not belong to the same tax consolidated group. These thin-capitalization rules could apply at the level of the Issuer (in respect of any loans contracted by the Issuer from any related party) and at level of the Issuer’s French subsidiaries that do not belong to the same French tax consolidated group as the Issuer with respect to any amount of the proceeds of the Notes used by the Issuer to grant intragroup loans to such subsidiaries as well as, more generally, in respect of any loans contracted by the Issuer’s French subsidiaries from any related party. Finally, the French Finance Law for 2020 included specific provisions which implement into French tax legislation the provisions of the ATAD II in relation to hybrid mismatches with third countries, which are applicable as from January 1, 2020, except for certain of its provisions which will be applicable as from January 1, 2022. In relation to such implementation, the provisions of Article 212-1-(b) of the French Tax Code (i.e., the former French anti-hybrid provisions) have been repealed. Articles 205 B et seq. of the French Tax Code implementing ATAD II provide limitations on interest deductions in the event of (i) a deduction of a payment at the level of a paying entity without a corresponding inclusion of such payment in the taxable income of the receiving entity (referred to as a “deduction without inclusion”) or (ii) a deduction of the same payment, operational expenses or losses in the taxable income of both the paying and receiving entity (referred to as a “double deduction”). Such limitations only apply to payments taking place between “associated enterprises,” except for the so-called “structured arrangements” (i.e., an arrangement pricing the relevant mismatch or an arrangement designed to produce the mismatch, subject to certain conditions). If the hybrid mismatch results in a deduction without inclusion, the deduction from taxable income will generally be denied to the French paying entity. Alternatively, the payment to a French receiving entity will be included in its taxable income if deduction is not denied in the jurisdiction of the paying entity. If the hybrid mismatch results in a double deduction, the deduction will either be denied at the level of the receiving entity or at the level of the paying entity. In respect of fiscal years opened as from January 1, 2022, these provisions also cover reverse hybrid entities, referring to situations where an entity is deemed to be tax transparent by the Member State in which it is incorporated or established and the jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which its “associated enterprises” (i.e., entities holding directly or indirectly in aggregate of more an interest in 50% or more of its voting rights, capital interests or rights to share profit) are established, qualify the entity as non-transparent. Where such an hybrid entity is incorporated or established in France, its income is, as the case may be, either subject to French corporate income tax at its own level or taxable pursuant to Article 8 of the French Tax Code at the level of its partners or shareholders, to the extent that it is not taxed in another State. 40 ----- The above-mentioned tax rules may limit our ability to deduct interest accrued on our indebtedness incurred in France and, as a consequence, may thus increase our tax burden, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and reduce the cash flow available to service our indebtedness.",,,,N/A

Generally, claims of creditors, including lenders and trade creditors, and claims of preference shareholders (if any), will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings over the claims of a company’s ordinary shareholders, including the claims of its parent entity. Accordingly, claims of creditors and preference shareholders of the Issuer’s subsidiaries will also generally have priority over the claims of creditors of its parent entity. In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings of any of the Issuer’s non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their debt and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to the Issuer. As such, the Notes will be structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors (including lenders and trade creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of the Issuer’s non-guarantor subsidiaries. While the Issuer’s non-guarantor subsidiaries will be required, if they guarantee certain types of debt, also to guarantee the Notes, such non-guarantor subsidiaries will also be permitted under the Indenture to incur or guarantee some debt without providing such guarantees, and any such future debt will also be structurally senior to the Notes.

The Issuer and the Issue Date Guarantor are dependent upon the cash flow from their operating subsidiaries available to them, by dividend, interest payments on intercompany loans or other distributions to meet their obligations, including under the Notes or the relevant Guarantee. The amounts of such payments, dividends and other distributions available to the Issuer and such Issue Date Guarantor will depend on the profitability and cash flows of their respective subsidiaries as well as the ability of those subsidiaries to declare dividends under applicable law.

The obligations of the Guarantors and the enforcement of each of their Guarantees will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by such entities under applicable law, including a limitation to the extent that the grant of such guarantee is not in the entity’s corporate interests, or otherwise would result in violations of laws related to corporate benefit, capitalization, capital preservation, financial assistance or transactions under value. Accordingly, enforcement of a Guarantee against the relevant grantor would be subject to certain defenses available to guarantors generally or, in some cases, to limitations contained in the terms of the Guarantees designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant Guarantors. These laws and defenses include those that relate to fraudulent conveyances or transfers, insolvency, voidable preferences, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization and defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its Guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending on the law applicable to it. It is possible that a Guarantor, or a creditor thereof, or the bankruptcy trustee in the case of a bankruptcy of such entity, may contest the validity and enforceability of a Guarantee on any of the aforementioned grounds and that the applicable court may determine that a Guarantee should be limited or voided. To the extent such limitations on guarantees apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, including trade payables of such entity to the extent of such limitations. Future guarantees may be subject to similar limitations. 42 ----- _France. French law requires that, when a French company grants a guarantee of third-party_ obligations, the guarantee must be in the corporate purpose and corporate interest of the guarantor company. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor is a matter of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance. The liabilities of a French company under a guarantee must also not be in breach of French financial assistance rules. The liabilities and obligations of Guarantors organized under the laws of France under the applicable Guarantee are therefore subject to (i) certain exceptions, including the exclusion of any obligations which, if incurred, would constitute the provision of financial assistance within the meaning of Article L.225-216 of the French _Code de Commerce, which prohibits a company from guaranteeing indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of the acquisition or the subscription of its own shares and/or a misuse of corporate assets or of credit within the meaning of Articles L.241-3, L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French _Code de Commerce; and (ii) a financial limitation corresponding to an amount equal to the proceeds from the issue of the Notes which the Issuer has applied for the direct or indirect benefit of the relevant Guarantor and/or to the controlled subsidiaries of that Guarantor (within the meaning of article L.233-3 of the French Code de Commerce) through intercompany loans and cash pooling arrangements (if any) that are outstanding and owed by such Guarantor (or any of its controlled subsidiaries) on the date a payment is requested to be made by the Guarantor. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes. _Italy. An Italian company entering into a transaction (including granting a guarantee) must_ receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee or the security interest being provided by such company. The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation and it is assessed and determined by a factual analysis on a case by case basis and its existence is purely a business decision to the directors and the statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration including in case of up-stream, downstream and cross-stream guarantees for the financial obligations of group companies. The general rule is that the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of such guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. The absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including the granting of a guarantee granted by an Italian company) ultra vires and potentially affected by a conflict of interest. _Spain. Unlike other jurisdictions, there is no concept of “corporate benefit” expressly regulated_ under the Spanish Companies Act or any other piece of legislation, However, Spanish lower courts, particularly Spanish commercial courts (Juzgados de lo Mercantil) ruling on insolvency matters, are declaring null or rescinding upstream guarantees by applying the rebuttable presumption of actions detrimental to the estate of an affiliate granting guarantees in favor of the liabilities incurred by a parent company, when the obligations guaranteed do not provide for a direct benefit to the Spanish company granting such guarantee. Certain decisions by the Spanish Supreme Court are ruling in favor of the validity and enforceability of such guarantees to the extent evidence can be given that amounts can be borrowed directly by the company granting the guarantee or indirectly on-lent or otherwise made available to such company, also taking into account any indirect benefits deriving from the enhancement of the financial position of the group of companies to which such company belongs. However, it cannot be conclusively ensured that further proof of the actual existence of benefits and compensatory advantages would need to be delivered to court, to the insolvency administrator and/or the insolvency court in the event of an insolvency.

Your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees will thus be subject to the laws of a number of jurisdictions, and it may be difficult to effectively enforce such rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multijurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights.

In addition, under certain circumstances, the Guarantee of a Guarantor may be released automatically (see “Description _of the Notes—Limitations on Guarantees of Debt”), including, without limitation:_ - upon the sale or disposition (including through merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination) or conveyance, transfer or lease of the Capital Stock (as that term is defined “Description of the Notes”), or all or substantially all of the assets, of that Guarantor to a person that is not (either before or after giving effect to the transaction) the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (as that term is defined “Description of the Notes”), if the sale or other disposition does not violate the Indenture; - in connection with any sale or other disposition of the Capital Stock of that Guarantor (or Capital Stock of any holding company of such Guarantor (other than the Issuer)) (whether by direct sale or through a holding company) to a person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the Indenture and as a result of such disposition such Guarantor no longer qualifies as a Subsidiary of the Issuer; - upon a defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture; - upon the designation by the Issuer of the Guarantor (or a holding company thereof) as an Unrestricted Subsidiary (as that term is defined “Description of the Notes”) in compliance with the terms of the Indenture; - upon the liquidation or dissolution of the Guarantor; provided that no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing; 44 ----- - upon repayment in full of the Notes; - the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization (as that term is defined “Description _of the Notes”);_ - in the case of any Restricted Subsidiary that after the Issue Date is required to guarantee the Notes pursuant to the covenant described under “Description of the Notes— _Limitations on Guarantees of Debt,” the release or discharge of the guarantee by such_ Restricted Subsidiary which resulted in the obligation to guarantee the Notes; - as described under “Description of the Notes—Amendments and Waivers”; or - as a result of a transaction permitted by “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants— _Merger and Consolidation.”_",,,,N/A

The occurrence of specified events that would constitute a change of control would also require early repayment of the New Term Loan and any drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, a failure by the Issuer to purchase the Notes after a change of control in accordance with the terms of the Indenture would result in a default under the New Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility and may cause such a default under the Group’s other indebtedness. If a Change of Control were to occur, the Issuer cannot assure you that the restrictions in the Senior Facilities Agreement or other contractual obligations would allow it to make such required repurchases. If an event constituting a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from repurchasing Notes, the Issuer will need to seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to purchase the Notes, or to attempt to repay or offer to repay the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such a consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any tendered Notes, which will be an event of default under the Notes. In addition, the Issuer may not have the resources to finance the redemption of the Notes and an early repayment of the New Term Loan required by a Change of Control, and currently the Issuer expects that it would require third party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control. The Issuer cannot give any assurances that it would be able to obtain such financing. The change of control provision in the Indenture may not necessarily afford investors protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving the Group that may adversely affect holders of Notes, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “change of control” as defined in the Indenture governing the Notes.

The measures of insolvency for the purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law applied in any proceedings to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred the debt: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it cannot pay its debts as they become due. We cannot be sure as to what standard a court would apply in making a solvency determination or that a court would conclude that any Guarantor was solvent after the granting of Guarantees. Regardless of the standard that the court uses, we cannot be sure that the granting of the Guarantees would not be voided or subordinated to our other debt.

Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to admit such Notes for trading on the Euro MTF Market. However, there is a risk that no liquid secondary market for the Notes will develop or, if it does develop, that it will not continue. The fact that the Notes may be listed does not necessarily lead to greater liquidity as compared to unlisted Notes. In an illiquid market, an investor is subject to the risk that he will not be able to sell his Notes at any time at fair market prices or even at all. The liquidity of any market for the Notes will depend on the number of holders of such Notes, prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities and other factors, including general economic conditions and the Group’s financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as recommendations of securities analysts. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices.

A holder of fixed rate notes is particularly exposed to the risk that the price of such notes falls as a result of changes in the market interest rate. While the nominal interest rate is fixed during the life of the Notes, the market interest rate typically changes on a daily basis. As the market interest rate changes, the price of fixed rate notes also changes, but in the opposite direction. Thus, if the market interest rate increases, the price of fixed rate notes typically falls, until the yield of such notes is approximately equal to the market interest rate of comparable issues. If the market interest rate decreases, the price of fixed rate notes typically increases, until the yield of such notes is approximately equal to the market interest rate of comparable issues.

The Green Deal in Europe to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% in 2030 and to have no net emissions in 2050 is a clear demonstration of this, as is the emphasis put on renewable energy in economic recovery plans. With transport accounting for around one quarter of global CO2 emissions and passenger vehicles accounting for around 10%, the automotive industry has a strong responsibility to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce its environmental impact. Climate change, and businesses’ response to its emerging threats, are under increasing scrutiny by governments, regulators and the public alike. We face various risks associated with climate change including increasing levels of regulation, changes in consumer behaviour and the potential impact of increases in extreme weather events. The automotive sector is subject to increasing regulatory constraints related to CO2 emissions including, in particular, European Regulation 2019/631, which provides for additional reductions in CO2 emissions of passenger vehicles by 37.5% from 2021 to 2030. In addition, the automotive sector may be strongly impacted in the future by the introduction of stricter regulations on climate issues, particularly in the area of vehicle life cycle analysis. Regulations on the life cycle carbon footprint of vehicles would have a direct impact on the products and solutions that we provide. Our greenhouse gas emissions footprint consists of our direct and indirect emissions (scopes 1 and 2, respectively), and mostly from our controlled upstream and downstream value chain (scope 3), as well as from our purchasing activities. To accelerate the climate transition, public authorities are expected to constrain total footprint with new taxes and regulations. In addition, more extensive regulations aimed at reducing emissions of NOx in urban areas and CO2 globally could lead to an increase in demand for vehicles that pollute less. Consumer behaviour may also evolve as a result of greater environmental awareness, encouraging new models of mobility and vehicle ownership as well as the purchase of more ecofriendly vehicles. Finally, extreme weather-related events (such as floods, cyclones and storms) may impact production facilities located near rivers or basins, which could disrupt production and thereby lead to customer delays and, potentially, loss of business. Failure to anticipate, identify and manage risks associated with climate transition could have a significant impact on our financial condition, business and reputation. Furthermore, our operations may be interrupted due to the loss, closure or suspension of our production facilities, whether as a result of extreme weather-related events or failure to comply with more stringent regulations.",,,,N/A

The cyclical nature that characterizes our customers’ businesses can have a significant impact on our sales and results. The level of sales and production for each of our customers depends on numerous parameters, notably the general level of consumption of goods and services in a given market, confidence levels of participants in that market, buyers’ ability to access credit for vehicle purchases, and in some cases, governmental aid programs (such as the financial support provided to the automotive sector and incentives introduced for the purchase of vehicles). Our sales are directly linked to the performance of the automotive industry in the major geographic regions where we and our customers operate, especially in Europe (which constituted 44.8% of our sales in 2021), Asia (which constituted 26.7% of our sales in 2021) and North America (which constituted 23.8% of our sales in 2021). Our sales are also related to the commercial success of the models for which we produce components and modules. At the end of a vehicle’s life cycle, there is significant uncertainty around whether our products will be taken up again for the replacement model. In addition, orders placed with us are open orders without any guarantees of minimum volumes and are generally based on the life of the vehicle model concerned. There can be no guarantee that our products will be utilized for the replacement model, and we could therefore be required to make certain investments in supply contracts that may not be offset by customer order volumes, which would generate a significant impact on our operating income.

If one or more of our main suppliers were to go bankrupt, or experience an unforeseen stock-out, quality problems, social unrest, a strike or any other incident disrupting the supplies for which it is committed to us, this could negatively impact our image or production output or lead to additional costs, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have been and could be impacted in the future in the event of supplier failures, for example, following a major disaster impacting a supplier’s production sites, a health crisis, production quality issues, delivery of less than required quantities or a shortage of certain raw materials or components, such as electronic components. We are also subject to negative impacts as a result of disruptions to suppliers in the global value chain. The global value chain has in the past experienced disruptions as the result of a general lack of production capacity for certain raw materials or components, such as the current shortage of semiconductors. Such shortages may be further exacerbated by climatic events, such as the winter storms in Texas, or other external factors, such as the Covid-19 pandemic and fires in Japan that have disrupted the production of semiconductors. In addition, global economic recovery, such as the recovery from the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, has created and may continue to create pressure on demand for raw materials or components, which may result in a disruption to production further down the global value chain. In addition, if we or one of our suppliers or service providers default at any stage of the manufacturing process, or if we are no longer able to purchase such raw materials or components in sufficient quantities or at sufficiently affordable prices to meet existing customer orders, we may be held liable for failure to fulfil our contractual obligations or for technical problems. In such a case, we may also be required to pay compensation related to the difficulty of continuing current projects. Disruptions in supply chains or a decline in the volume of vehicles produced by global carmakers as a result of tension in supply and logistics chains would have a material adverse effect on our business, turnover, sales, financial situation, financial results, outlook and share price.",,,,N/A

Each contract we make with a customer is a program with a lifespan of up to ten years from the development phase through to the production phase. As part of the tender process, we carry out a detailed risk assessment to ensure that we identify and manage the nature and level or risks that we may be exposed to and, during the life of the program, we monitor the program in order to ensure operational and financial performance. In 2021, we managed approximately 800 programs on a permanent basis.

In addition, we could experience difficulties in attracting and retaining the necessary talent able to provide the skills required for the development or production of our products and services, particularly if the automotive industry is considered less attractive to younger generations. Moreover, we compete with other companies for suitably qualified personnel, including technical and engineering personnel. If management or key positions remain unfilled for too long, if turnover rates are too high or if diversity is insufficient, the level of motivation and productivity of our teams, as well as the cost of recruiting, training and integrating new employees, could be impacted.

These may result in particular from heightened geopolitical tensions (including those between the U.S. and China and between Russia and Ukraine), regional instability or the imposition of trade barriers and protectionist policies in various countries. As of 30 June 2022, we operated in more than 40 countries and generated 46.1% of our sales in Europe, 24.2% in Asia, 25.6% in North America and 4.2% in the rest of the world. Our international business activities, notably in emerging countries, are exposed to certain risks inherent in any activity carried out overseas, including: - any potential amendments to laws or regulations, or to commercial, monetary or fiscal policies applied in certain foreign countries and, in particular, risks of expropriation and nationalization; - customs regulations, monetary control policies, investment restrictions or requirements or any other constraints such as levies or other forms of taxation on settlements and other payment terms adopted by subsidiaries; - difficulties in enforcing agreements, collecting payments due and protecting property through foreign legal systems, in particular, where intellectual property protection is less stringent; and - supply chain tensions and their consequences. Inadequate planning or preparations for regulatory decisions or changes made to legal requirements could have a significant negative impact on our business, finances and results of operations. For example, the government authorities in a country in which we operate could update standards that apply to our products, which could have negative consequences on our operating income. In addition, our business is affected by general economic conditions and macroeconomic trends which can impact overall demand for our products and the markets in which we operate including, for example, inflation and trade tensions between the EU and the U.S. and between the U.S. and China. Furthermore, any weakening in economic conditions may affect the automotive supply industry globally, and negative economic conditions in one or more regions may affect the automotive supply industry in other regions. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by an economic downturn on a global scale or in significant markets in which we operate. These risks may be further exacerbated by macroeconomic trends and developments, such as trade tensions between various countries and regions, which could lead to unfavorable changes in trade policies that apply to our products.

127,Final Offerings 2022.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to Our Operations,1.1.11,We operate in the highly competitive automotive supply industry where customers can exert significant price pressure.,"The global automotive supply sector is highly competitive. Competition is based mainly on price, global presence, technology, quality, delivery, design and engineering capabilities, new product innovation and customer service as a whole. There are no guarantees that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors. Supply contracts are mostly awarded through competitive bids, and are often 40 ----- subject to renewed bidding when their terms expire. Although the overall number of competitors has decreased due to on-going industry consolidation, we face significant competition within each of our major product areas, including from new competitors entering the markets that we serve. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete favorably in these competitive markets or that increased competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation by reducing our ability to increase or maintain sales and profit margins. The failure to obtain new business projects on new models, or to retain or increase business projects on redesigned existing models, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, as a result of the relatively long lead times required for many of our structural components, it may be difficult for us to adequately manage the execution of a program from development to launch, adequately respond to any deterioration in the profitability of a program or to obtain new revenues in the short-term to replace any unexpected decline in the sale of existing products.",,,,N/A

Our variable rate financial debt relates primarily to the Senior Credit Facility, when drawn, the Bridge Facilities, the EIB Loan and the Latin American Syndicated Loan, as well as our short-term debt. Our main fixed rate debt consists of the 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 2027 Sustainability-Linked Notes, the 2028 Notes, the 2029 Green Notes, the Schuldscheindarlehen. We manage hedging of interest rate risks centrally. This management is handled by our Finance and Treasury Department, which reports to our General Management. Interest rate hedging decisions are made by a Market Risk Management Committee that meets on a monthly basis. Since a significant part of our borrowings are at variable rates, the aim of our interest rate hedging policy is to reduce the impact of short-term rate changes on earnings. Our hedges primarily comprise euro-denominated interest rate swaps. They hedge a part of our interest payable in 2022 and 2023 against a rise in interest rates. Our interest rate position with respect to the different types of financial instruments used is detailed in note 30.3 to our audited 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements. Any significant variation in interest rates combined with a poor application of the hedging policy for these rates would lead to an increase in financial costs and could have a significate impact on our financial results.",,,,N/A

Excessive fluctuations in exchange rates could have a negative impact on our financial results. See note 30.1 of our audited 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on changes in exchange rates of transaction currencies (other than their functional currency) used by our subsidiaries (with all other variables remaining constant). We centrally manage currency risks relating to the commercial transactions of our subsidiaries, mainly using forward purchase and sale contracts and options as well as foreign currency financing. We manage foreign 41 ----- exchange risks centrally, through our Finance and Treasury Department, which reports to our General Management. Hedging decisions are made by a Market Risk Management Committee that meets on a monthly basis. Currency risks on forecast transactions are hedged based on estimated cash flows determined in forecasts validated by our General Management. The related derivatives are classified as cash flow hedges when there is a hedging relationship that satisfies IFRS 9 financial instruments: recognition and measurement (which outlines the requirements for the recognition and measurement of financial assets) (“IFRS 9”) criteria. Subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the euro are granted inter-company loans in their operating currencies. Although these loans are refinanced in euros and eliminated in the consolidation of our audited consolidated financial statements, they contribute to our currency risk exposure and are therefore hedged through swaps.

If we experience a problem with the functioning of an important IT system or a security breach of our IT systems, including during system upgrades and/or new system implementations, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business. We implement security measures in relation to our IT systems but we, like other companies, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyberattacks and other similar disruptions. In particular, our implementation of digital services and storage have made our computer systems important for our day-to-day operations and as a result we faced with risks that could compromise (i) the availability and proper functioning of computer equipment used in plant production, (ii) the confidentiality of personal data, as well as, more generally, (iii) the integrity and availability of information systems, particularly those contributing to business processes related to ordering, supply and invoicing or to marketed digital products and services. In addition, certain of our products or components such as infotainment, Android system embedded applications or wireless chargers that connect with smartphones contain complex information technology systems, software and/or data connectivity features and may be vulnerable to unauthorized access aimed at gaining control of, changing the functionality of or gaining access to data stored in or generated by these products. We collect, store, process, transmit and use certain personal information and other user data belonging to our employees, customers and suppliers in our business. We must ensure that any processing, collection, use, storage, dissemination, transfer and disposal of data for which we are responsible complies with relevant data protection and privacy laws, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Non-compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation can lead to legal consequences, including fines, as well as reputational damage. As a result, any system failure, accident, security breach or delivery of flawed digital product or service could result in disruptions to our operations. A material network breach in the security of our IT systems could result in the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets, customer or supplier information, human resources information or other confidential information. To the extent that any disruptions or security breach result in a loss or damage to our data, or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential, proprietary or customer or supplier information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers or suppliers, lead to claims against us and ultimately harm our business.

127,Final Offerings 2022.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Related to Our Operations,1.1.16,We are subject to fluctuations in the prices of raw materials.,"We are exposed to commodity risk through our direct purchases of raw materials and indirectly through components purchased from our suppliers. The proportion of our direct purchases of raw materials, mainly steel 42 ----- and thermoplastic resins, and the raw materials share of indirect purchases of components made of these same raw materials, represented approximately 40% of purchases in 2021. The prices of these raw materials are subject to fluctuations, the underlying causes of which are linked to structural supply capacity, demand, international geopolitical relations and impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. Our operating and net income could be adversely affected by changes in the prices of the raw materials we use, notably steel and plastics. To the extent that our sales contracts with customers do not include price indexation clauses linked to the price of raw materials, we are exposed to risks related to unfavorable fluctuations in commodity prices. We do not use derivatives to hedge our purchases of raw materials or energy. In addition, the Covid-19 pandemic has added pressure on raw materials supplies with a potential impact on their prices, including risks related to shortages of semiconductors (which are present in a number of our products) that are expected to continue through part or all of 2022 at a minimum. If commodity prices were to rise steeply, we may not be able to pass on all such price increases to our customers, which could have an unfavorable impact on our sales and which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we are unable to secure a sufficient quantity of semiconductors, we could be exposed to operational losses as well as client claims seeking indemnification. Bottlenecks in the value chain, which are mainly the result of a general shortage of certain electronic components and have been amplified by external factors over which we have limited control, could result in higher costs of transportation, raw materials, energy, workforce and quality assurance, for example, which may affect our financial results. These raw materials risks could also affect customer-supplier relationships. Automakers could require the creation of larger safety stocks, which could result in revisions of existing contractual arrangement.

Although the length, impact and outcome of the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine is highly unpredictable, this conflict has and could continue to disrupt markets, including significant volatility in commodity prices, financial markets, supply chain interruptions, changes in consumer or purchaser preferences as well as increase in cyberattacks and espionage. We have operated and continue to operate certain sites in Russia, including an industrial site in Togliatti in the Samara region that we opened in 2021, and generated sales in Russia of approximately €200 million in 2021, representing 1.3% of our total sales. Hella generated sales in Russia of less than €50 million in 2021, representing less than 0.5% of Hella’s total sales. We do not have direct operations or material sales in Ukraine, although Ukraine is a major exporter of wire harnesses used in the production of automobiles. The conflict in the region has had and could continue to have a direct impact on our operations and sales in Russia, and has also had an indirect impact on automotive production globally. Continuation of the conflict could lead to further supply chain disruptions and may have a material adverse impact on demand for our products. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has impacted global energy markets, particularly in Europe, leading to high volatility and increasing prices for crude oil, natural gas and other energy supplies. Higher energy costs result in increases in operating expenses at our manufacturing facilities, in the expense of shipping raw materials to our facilities, and in the expense of shipping products. Russia’s annexation of portions of Ukraine and military action against Ukraine have led to sanctions being levied by the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Switzerland, Japan and other countries targeting persons and entities in Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine, including, among others, removing certain Russian financial institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (“SWIFT”) payment system, which can significantly hinder the ability to transfer funds in and out of Russia. In response, Russia has instituted counter-sanctions against such countries. The situation is rapidly evolving as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, and the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and other countries may implement additional sanctions, export controls or other measures against Russia or other countries, regions, officials, individuals or industries in the respective territories. Such sanctions 43 ----- and other measures, as well as any potential responses from Russia or other countries to such sanctions, tensions and military actions, could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We have experienced major accidents in the past, such as fires, flooding and explosions, and although we have extensive health and safety policies in place, we cannot assure you that we will be able to prevent future industrial accidents at our plants or R&D centers in the future. In addition, some of our plants are highly specialized in terms of manufacturing, and it would be difficult to set up alternative solutions within a short period of time in the event of a major accident. Our industrial activities and use of a large number of potentially polluting products and materials in the context of the product production process expose us to environmental risks, such as the risk of accidental pollution and other risks related to the tightening of environmental regulations. We may also be exposed to operational risks related to poor energy management (such as generating excessive CO2 emissions) or poor management of raw materials or waste. Any failure to comply with environmental regulations could cause damage to our reputation and generate a significate financial impact, including in the form of criminal law sanctions or lost opportunities. Accidental pollution could also force us to pay considerably for the decontamination of the sites impacted.

For example, in 2020, Faurecia completed the acquisitions of (i) the Canadian company IRYStec Inc., which specializes in display technologies, and (ii) SAS, a major player in the assembly and logistics of complex modules for vehicle interiors. In 2021, Faurecia also acquired (i) the Russian company ACP, specialized in the production of vehicle interior systems in the Togliatti region, (ii) the UK company Design Led, specialized in advanced backlighting technologies, and (iii) CLD, one of the main Chinese producers of hydrogen reservoirs, based in Shenyang. In August 2021, Faurecia announced its proposed business combination with the German company Hella. The Hella Acquisition was completed on 31 January 2022, following the acquisition of 60% of Hella’s shares from its family shareholders and the voluntary cash tender offer launched by Faurecia on 27 September 2021 at the end of which Faurecia acquired an additional 19.5% of Hella’s shares. As of 30 June 2022, Faurecia held 81.59% of the share capital of Hella. Hella’s sales for the period from 1 February 2022 through 30 June 2022 during which it was consolidated in Forvia’s financial results represented 24% of the Group’s consolidated sales for the six months ended 30 June 2022 (for more information on the acquisition, see “Recent Developments— _Combining Faurecia and Hella”)._ There are several risks inherent to acquisitions which could occur, including, in particular: - risk of overestimation of the target value; - risk of the anticipated synergies being significantly delayed or not being achieved; - risk of not succeeding in integrating the acquired companies and their technologies, product ranges and employees; - risk of departure of key employees; - risk of higher than expected costs related to the integration of acquired companies; - risks related to suppliers or customers, or the loss of contracts resulting in costly or unfavorable financial conditions; - existence of new specific risks within the target including risks the Group failed to identify during the due diligence investigations (tax, environmental, ethics, legal, etc.); - risk of increased indebtedness in order to finance the acquisition or refinance the debt of the target. In addition, due to the nature and the date of the Hella Acquisition closing (i.e., an acquisition of a listed company, involving several antitrust review processes) we only had access to Hella’s public financial 47 ----- information upon the closing of the Hella Acquisition on 31 January 2022. This date did not allow for a detailed review of potential changes of accounting policies and further impacts on Hella’s financial statements, in particular the amortization period of tangible and intangible assets, as well as the treatment of certain study costs related to customer programs. The benefits expected from future or completed acquisitions may not be realized within the anticipated time frames and/or at the levels expected and, consequently, may significantly affect our business, financial position and results of operations. The expected benefits of the Hella Acquisition in particular depend upon the successful integration of Hella’s activities. We could face significant difficulties implementing an integration plan, some of which may have been unforeseeable or outside of our control or the control of Hella, notably with respect to differences in norms, controls, procedures and rules, corporate culture, the history of technological investments and our organization and Hella, and the need to integrate and harmonize the various operating systems and procedures that are specific to each group, such as financial and accounting systems and other IT systems. The costs we incur in integrating Hella or trying to realize anticipated synergies may be substantially higher than our current estimates and may outweigh any benefit. Furthermore, if the assumptions and estimates used by us to value the acquisition prove to be inaccurate, it could result in an impairment of the goodwill recorded in respect of the transaction.",,,,N/A

Generally, claims of creditors of a subsidiary, including lenders and trade creditors, will effectively have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the rights of its ordinary shareholders, including the Issuer. Accordingly, claims of creditors of a subsidiary will also effectively have priority over the claims of creditors of the Issuer, including claims of holders of the Notes.

Changes in tax laws or regulations or in their interpretation could adversely affect our tax position, such as our effective tax rate or tax payments. In particular, European and French tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and are subject to varying interpretations. For example, the current implementation into French tax law of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (the “OECD”) principles related to base erosions and profit shifting (“BEPS”) included in the final reports released by the OECD as well as the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS signed in Paris on 7 June 2017, and ratified by France on 26 September 2018, may increase the administrative efforts within our business and impact existing structures. Furthermore, the European Union continues to harmonize the tax legislation of the member states. In this respect, the Council of the European Union (the “Council of the European Union”) adopted a directive “laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market” on 12 July 2016 (Council Directive 2016/1164) (the “ATAD”). The ATAD was later amended on 29 May 2017, by the Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 (the “ATAD 2”), which, inter alia, extends the scope of the ATAD to hybrid mismatches involving third countries and provides that its provisions shall apply (subject to certain exceptions), as from 1 January 2020. Among the set of proposed measures, the ATAD provides, in particular, for a general interest limitation rule pursuant to which the tax deduction of net financial expenses is limited to 30% of the taxpayer’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) or to a maximum amount of €3,000,000, whichever is higher (subject to several exceptions). Such new rules apply since 1 January 2019, following their transposition into French tax law by Article 34 of the French Finance Law for 2019 (Law 20181317 of 28 December 2018) (the “French Finance Law for 2019”) of the general interest limitation rule provided for by the ATAD. The French Finance Law for 2020 (Law 2019-1479 of 28 December 2019) (the “French Finance Law for 2020”) also introduced under French tax law the provisions of the ATAD 2 and thus repealed the existing French anti-hybrid rules, as set forth in Article 212-I-b of the French Code général des _impôts (the “FTC”). See “—Risks Related to the Notes—French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility,_ 55 ----- _for French tax purposes, of all or a portion of the interest on our indebtedness incurred in France on our indebtedness, thus reducing the cash flow available to service our indebtedness” for more details on this rule._ In addition, Article 108 of the French Finance Law for 2019 introduced under French tax law, the anti-abuse provision provided for by the ATAD with respect to French corporate income tax, which aims to address abusive tax practices that are not dealt with by specifically targeted provisions. Pursuant to this provision, the French tax authorities may ignore an arrangement, or a series of arrangements, which, having been put into place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the applicable tax law, are not genuinely taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances. The European Commission also published a corporate reform package proposal on 25 October 2016, including three new proposals that aim at (i) relaunching the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (“CCCTB”) which is a single set of rules to compute companies' taxable profits in the European Union, (ii) avoiding loopholes associated with profit-shifting for tax between European Union countries and non-European Union countries, and (iii) providing new dispute resolution rules to relieve problems with double taxation for businesses. On 18 May 2021 the European Commission communicated a new plan called Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation (“BEFIT”) which aims to replace the CCCTB in the European tax policy proposals. BEFIT is based mainly on the framework of the OECD's international tax reform project, and would involve the consolidation of the profits of the EU members of a multinational group into a single tax base, which will then be allocated to Member States using a formula, to be taxed at national corporate income tax rates. The preparation for this new proposal will be carried out by the European Commission alongside the Member States and the European Parliament and will give rise to consultations with the business sector and civil society groups. The Commission’s aim is to introduce BEFIT into EU legislation by 2023. Alongside BEFIT, the European Commission also announced, among other things, that it would (i) table a legislative proposal setting out union rules to neutralize the misuse of shell entities for tax purposes – the European Commission having made public a proposed directive on 22 December 2021 which once adopted, should be transposed by European member states prior to 30 June 2023 and then enter into force on 1 January 2024, (ii) adopt a recommendation on the domestic treatment of losses and (iii) make a legislative proposal creating a Debt Equity Bias Reduction Allowance (“DEBRA”). On 8 October 2021, members of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS (the Inclusive Framework) agreed to the Statement on the Two-Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy reflecting the agreement reached by 136 out of the 140 Inclusive Framework members. The Two-Pillar Solution is comprised of Pillar One and Pillar Two. Pillar One aims at ensuring a distribution of profits and taxing rights among countries with respect to the largest multinational enterprises (“MNEs”) through the re-allocation of taxing rights over 25% of the residual profit of the largest and most profitable MNEs to the jurisdictions where the customers and users of those MNEs are located. Pillar Two puts a floor on tax competition on corporate income tax through the introduction of a global minimum corporate tax at a rate of 15% that countries can use to protect their tax bases (the GloBE rules). On 20 December 2021, the OECD published the pillar two model rules (the “Model Rules”) for the domestic implementation of the 15% global minimum tax rate agreed upon in October 2021. The new Model Rules aim to assist countries to bring the GloBE rules into domestic legislation. They provide for a coordinated system of interlocking rules that (i) define the MNEs within the scope of the minimum tax; (ii) set out a mechanism for calculating an MNE’s effective tax rate on a jurisdictional basis, and for determining the amount of top-up tax payable under the rules; and (iii) determine the member of the MNE group which will be required to pay the top-up tax. On 22 December 2021, the European Commission published a legislative proposal for a Directive setting forth rules to ensure a global minimum level of taxation for multinational groups. The draft Directive aims at consistently implementing among all 27 member states the Model Rules that include an Income Inclusion rule (“IIR”) and an Under Taxed Payment Rule (“UTPR”). However, it also extends its scope to large-scale purely domestic groups, in order to ensure compliance with the European Union fundamental freedoms. In addition, the draft Directive makes use of an option contemplated by the Inclusive Framework whereby the member state of a low-taxed income entity (referred as constituent entity) applying the IIR is required to ensure effective 56 ----- taxation at the minimum agreed level not only for foreign subsidiaries but also for all constituent entities residents in that member State. The proposal will move to the negotiation phase among the Member States with the aim of reaching a final agreement; the European Commission proposes that the member states shall transpose the Directive into their national laws by 21 December 2022 for the rules to come into effect as of 1 January 2023 (with the exception of the UTPR, for which the application will be deferred to 1 January 2024). The development of model legislation, a Multilateral Convention and a multilateral instrument for the implementation of the Two-Pillar Solution are expected to be finalized on 2022 in order the Two-Pillar Solution to be effective on 2023. Furthermore, new rules on tax dispute resolution already apply since 1 January 2019, following the transposition of Council Directive 2017/1852 of 10 October 2017 into French tax law as part of the French Finance Law for 2019. These new regulations could impact our tax position in the future. We often rely on generally available interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We cannot be certain that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these laws. If our tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require us to pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our rental offerings and services to track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",,,,N/A

Although holders of Notes should in principle be",1.4.2,"French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a portion of the interest incurred in France on our indebtedness, thus reducing the cash flow available to service our indebtedness.","Under article 39.1.3° of the FTC, the deduction of interest paid by a borrower to creditor that is a direct shareholder but not a related party within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC, is subject to the conditions that (i) the share capital of the borrowing company is fully paid-in and (ii) the interest rate on the corresponding loans does not exceed a rate equal to the annual average rate of floating rate loans granted by financial establishments for a minimum term of two years (currently 1.15% for companies closing their fiscal year between 28 February 2021 and 30 March 2022). By exception, Article 212, I-(a) of the FTC provides that interest incurred on loans granted by a related party within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC is deductible up to the rate referred to in Article 39.1.3° of the FTC or, if higher, up to the rate that the borrowing entity could have obtained from independent financial institutions in similar conditions. Moreover, under article 212 bis of the FTC, for financial years opened as from 1 January 2019, net financial expenses (“NFE”) are deductible up to the highest of €3,000,000 per financial year and 30% of the borrower’s adjusted EBITDA, corresponding to its taxable result before offset of tax losses and without taking into consideration tax, NFE and, to some extent, depreciation, amortization, provisions and capital gain/losses (subject to several exceptions). The NFE are defined as the excess, if any, of the financial expenses of the borrower over its financial income. If the borrower belongs to a consolidated group, and its ratio of own funds to aggregated assets is equal to or higher than the corresponding ratio of the group, then 75% of any non-deducted NFE, under the above rule, becomes deductible. If the borrower has a ratio of affiliated debts to own funds which exceeds 1.5, it is viewed as thinly capitalized, and the deduction of the NFE is governed by the following specific limitations: the portion of the NFE related to the affiliated debts which exceeds 1.5 times the borrower’s own funds is deductible up to the highest of the pro-rated €1,000,000 per financial year and 10% of the pro-rated EBITDA; the portion of the NFE related to the non-affiliated debts, and to the affiliated debts which do not exceed 1.5 times the borrower’s own funds, is deductible up to the highest of the pro-rated €3,000,000 per financial year and 30% of the pro-rated EBITDA. These specific limitations do not apply if the ratio of affiliated debts to own funds of the borrower is lower or equal to the corresponding ratio of the consolidated group to which it belongs. The portion of the NFE which is non-deductible, in respect of a given financial year, may be carried forward indefinitely and deducted from the subsequent financial years subject to the same limitations (in case of thinly capitalized entities, only one third of the NFE may be carried forward). Also if a portion of a deductibility 57 ----- capacity, in respect of a given financial year, is not fully used by the borrower (other than a thinly capitalized one), it may be carried forward to the next 5 financial years. Special rules apply to the NFE related to public infra structure projects and to members of French tax consolidated groups. In addition, the French Finance Law for 2020 has implemented into French tax legislation the provisions of the ATAD 2 in relation to hybrid mismatches with third countries, which are applicable as from 1 January 2020, except for certain of its provisions which are applicable since 1 January 2022. In relation to such implementation, the provisions of Article 212-1-(b) of the FTC (i.e., the former French anti-hybrid provisions) have been repealed. Articles 205 B et seq. of the FTC implementing ATAD 2 provide limitations on interest deductions in the event of (i) a deduction of a payment at the level of a paying entity without a corresponding inclusion of such payment in the taxable income of the receiving entity (referred to as a “deduction without inclusion”), or (ii) a deduction of the same payment, operational expenses or losses in the taxable income of both the paying and receiving entity (referred to as a “double deduction”). Unlike the previous domestic anti-hybrid rules, payments made to tax-exempt or low-taxed beneficiaries are not within the scope of the new rules that only target differences in qualification or attribution of the right to tax an element of income. Such limitations only apply to payments taking place between “associated enterprises,” except for the so-called “structured arrangements” (i.e., an arrangement pricing the relevant mismatch or an arrangement designed to produce the mismatch, subject to certain conditions). If the hybrid mismatch results in a deduction without inclusion, the deduction from taxable income will generally be denied to the French paying entity. Alternatively, the payment to a French receiving entity will be included in its taxable income if deduction is not denied in the jurisdiction of the paying entity. If the hybrid mismatch results in a double deduction, the deduction will either be denied at the level of the receiving entity or at the level of the paying entity. In respect of fiscal years opened as from 1 January 2022, these provisions also cover reverse hybrid entities, referring to situations where an entity is deemed to be tax transparent by the Member State in which it is incorporated or established but the jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which its “associated enterprises” holding directly or indirectly in aggregate an interest in 50% or more of its voting rights, capital interests or rights to share profit are established, qualify the entity as non-transparent. Where a hybrid entity of a reverse hybrid mismatch is incorporated or established in France, its income is, as the case may be, either subject to French corporate income tax or taxable pursuant to the conditions provided for by Article 8 of the FTC, to the extent that it is not taxed in another State.",,,,N/A

Transactions in the Notes could be subject to the European financial transaction tax, if adopted.","On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s Proposal”) for a Directive for a common Financial Transaction Tax (the “FTT”) in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the “Participating Member States”). The Commission’s Proposal has a very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. The issuance and subscription of Notes should, however, be exempt. In a common declaration dated 8 December 2015, the Participating Member States, excluding Estonia which ultimately indicated its withdrawal from the enhanced cooperation in March 2016, confirmed their intention to make decisions regarding the outstanding issues related to the FTT before the end of June 2016. Under the Commission’s Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a Participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a Participating Member State in a broad range 58 ----- of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a Participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a Participating Member State. At the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (“ECOFIN”) meeting of 14 June 2019, a state of play of the work on the FTT was presented on the basis of a note prepared by Germany on 7 June 2019 indicating a consensus among the Participating Member States (excluding Estonia) to continue negotiations on the basis of a joint French-German proposal based on the French financial transactions tax model which in principle would only concern shares of listed companies whose head office is in a Member State of the European Union. However, such proposal is still subject to change until a final approval. However, the Commission’s Proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate. In February 2021, the Portuguese Presidency of the Council proposed an inclusive discussion among all Member States on tax design issues of the FTT.

In addition, any of these events may have a direct impact on our ability to collect payments that we are owed under our rent payment guarantee (“Garantie de _loyers impayés”) and occupancy guarantee (“Garantie d’occupation”), which we offer to certain residential_ landlords and lessors, respectively. See “—Low demand for housing generally or lease terminations and/or _tenant defaults could adversely affect our fees and the income produced by the properties we manage, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.”_ Our results of operations are significantly impacted by economic trends, government policies and the real estate markets in the countries in which we operate. These include the following: overall economic activity, changes in interest rates, the impact of tax and regulatory policies, the cost and availability of credit and the geopolitical environment. The performance of our RRES services depends on our ability to collect fixed fees, charge variable fees for ancillary services, find tenants to bill transaction fees and collect rents. Our Joint Property Management business model is composed of fixed fees and variable fees related to additional services that could decline due to adverse economic conditions or administrative restrictions such as pandemic lockdowns. Additionally, the revenue derived from the Lease Management side of our Lease Management and Renting business is generally based on a percentage of rent collections from the properties we manage and, with respect to the renting side of the Lease Management and Renting business, from the one-off fees we receive for each new lease agreement entered into by our customers. The revenue generated by our business can be affected by many factors, including: (i) the magnitude of defaults by tenants under their respective leases, which may increase during distressed economic conditions; (ii) real estate and financial market conditions prevailing generally and regionally; and (iii) our ability to attract and retain creditworthy tenants, particularly during economic downturns. If tenants are unable to pay their rents, we are unable to collect the fees that are typically directly deducted from these rental payments. Adverse economic conditions or political or regulatory uncertainty could also impact our Brokerage business as it may lead to a decline in property sales and/or a reduction in sales prices, which in turn could reduce the commissions and fees that we earn in brokering such transactions. Economic, political and regulatory uncertainty, as well as significant changes and volatility in the financial markets, business environment and the global landscape, make it increasingly difficult for us to predict our future financial performance. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and _Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Macroeconomic and market conditions.”_ Following Brexit on January 31, 2020, the UK entered into a transition period which terminated on December 31, 2020, before which on December 24, 2020, the UK and the European Union agreed to a trade deal (the “Trade and Cooperation Agreement”) which was ratified by the UK on December 30, 2020 and is still subject to formal approval by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. While it is difficult to predict the effect of Brexit on the European and global economy, uncertainty regarding new or modified arrangements between the UK and the European Union could result in additional volatility in the markets, increased costs and a material adverse effect on consumer behavior.

The extent to which the coronavirus pandemic impacts our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response thereto; the effect on our customers, our customer’s financial position and customer and tenant demand for, and ability to pay for, our services; our ability to provide our services, including the impact of travel restrictions and staff working from home; and any closures of our offices and facilities. The COVID-19 pandemic had several significant effects on our business, including decreased demand for our services as a result of the slowdown in the European economies in which we operate and our inability to offer certain services as a result of government lockdown measures. In accordance with the decisions taken by most European governments in order to comply with social distancing recommendations, all premises (branches and head offices) were closed to the public during the lockdown period in France, Switzerland, Germany and Belgium, from approximately mid-March to mid-May 2020 (the “first lockdown”), as well as to employees (barring exceptional cases). During that period, real estate agents were barred from traveling to sign mandates or show properties and notaries were closed, which prevented any brokerage transactions from closing. For further discussion on notary execution, see “Regulation—France—Hoguet.” Moving into new premises during this period was particularly complicated, as only moves that could not be postponed could be carried out, which resulted in reduced letting fees for the period. The first lockdown measures imposed on the French, Swiss, German and Belgian population also negatively impacted our fee collection with an increasing number of residential and commercial tenants not being able to pay their rent on time or at all, although the rents remained owed as a matter of law. The lease management market was also affected as we collect a portion of rents via check, and there were disruptions with postal service, which led to delays in sending and receiving invoices and fees. For further discussion on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our various businesses, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors _Affecting Results of Operations—COVID-19 pandemic impact on our business.”_ The success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions, and thus the disruption caused by these factors could further impact some or all of our business divisions.

For example, many countries in Europe have reintroduced full or partial lockdowns in late 2020 in order to stem subsequent waves of higher infection rates. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or further lockdown measures could also adversely impact our ability to deliver our services. We anticipate some continuing impact on our EBITDA and revenue at least through the first half of 2021, but the impact may be longer lasting and we can offer no assurances as to when or if such impact will end.

Although we are Europe’s leading providers of residential real estate services, our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies and businesses. Depending on the geography, property type or business, we face competition from other residential or commercial real estate services providers and investment firms, in-house corporate real estate departments, developers, institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, investment managers, accounting firms and consulting ----- firms. Some of these firms may have greater financial resources allocated to a particular geography, property type or business than we have allocated to that geography, property type or business. In addition, future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other new competitors or further consolidation of the industry. For example, increased regulation following the implementation of the 2014 French access to housing and urban renovation law, l’accès au logement et un urbanisme rénové (“ALUR law”), and the increasing need to invest in the digitization of services has led to the increased consolidation of a highly fragmented market. For further discussion on the ALUR law, see “Regulation—France—ALUR.” Reaching critical scale is important for the digitization and industrialization of processes in order to reduce costs and improve customer service. Our industry is highly fragmented among regional, local and boutique providers. Although many of our existing competitors are local or regional firms that are smaller than we are, some of these competitors are larger or have a stronger presence on a local or regional basis or in their primary markets. We are further subject to competition from large national and multinational firms that have similar services to our commercial real estate business, and it is possible that further consolidation in the residential and commercial real estate industry could lead to much larger competitors in the geographies, property types and businesses that we serve. In addition, disruptive innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to effectively compete. Further, we also face competition from service providers, who may have greater knowledge of their home markets, a better understanding of the specificities of regulations and local legislation and established reputations in their region. There is no assurance that we will be able to effectively compete, maintain current fee levels or margins, or maintain or increase our market share.",,,,N/A
130,Final Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.1.4,"Low demand for housing generally or lease terminations and/or tenant defaults could adversely affect our fees and the income produced by the properties we manage, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.","Low demand for housing generally, or at a particular location due to economic, social or other conditions, may lead to a lower demand for our services. Moreover, our customers’ tenants could experience a change in their financial situation at any time, including as a result of global economic events, natural disasters and public health or pandemic crises. Our customers’ tenants may delay lease commencements, decline to extend or renew their leases upon expiration, fail to make rental payments when due, or declare bankruptcy. Any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenants’ leases, or expiration of existing leases without renewal, and the loss of rental income attributable to the terminated or expired leases. Although a significant portion of our revenues are derived from “stock” businesses consisting of providing fee-based services to our customer portfolio, the loss of income by our customers could hinder their ability to pay such fees. Moreover, while our fees for our Joint Property Management business are expected to be paid by the landlords whether or not the property is being rented or occupied by the landlord, for our Lease Management and Renting business, our fees are paid only if the properties are being rented and paid for by the tenants. Therefore, lease terminations may result in a decrease in fees that we receive. Additionally, even if the lease continues, but the tenant fails to pay rent, we will not be able to collect our fees because they are automatically deducted from rental payments. We also are prohibited by law in France from evicting tenants in the winter so the effect of non-payment may be greater during that time because we will not be able to evict and re-let the property as quickly as during other times in the year. See “Regulation.” In the event of a tenant default or bankruptcy, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights and may incur substantial costs in protecting our customers and re-letting their property. If commercial leases are terminated or defaulted upon, it may be difficult to find a tenant to whom the property can be re-let. We also offer a rent payment guarantee (“Garantie de loyers impayés”) to certain residential landlords who have entrusted us with the management of their property. Under this guarantee, we bear the cost of any unpaid rent and advance such rent to landlords. These advances are not always recoverable from the lessee and thus represent a risk of non-recovery. We also offer an occupancy guarantee (“Garantie d’occupation”) to a small number of lessors to protect against vacant properties for up to six months if we are unable to find a tenant on selected apartments in new buildings. As a result, we may bear the cost of any unoccupied properties under this guarantee. For example, the quantity of unpaid rent typically increases during the winter months when we are prohibited from evicting people under French law, and thus it is possible that we may experience an increase in loss of revenues if we are unable to rent such properties. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, our stock increased temporarily as it built up when we were unable to process disputes and evictions as a result of the first lockdown restrictions. In this case, the COVID-19 pandemic did not result in a significant increase in unpaid rent or defaults, however, we cannot ensure that our revenues will not be negatively impacted as a result of future lockdowns or other COVID-19-related disruptions. ----- There is no assurance that we will receive payments that we are owed under our rent payment and occupancy guarantees; therefore, both represent a large source of potential risk. Moreover, the occurrence of any of the situations described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We routinely explore acquiring other businesses and assets, and in the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed 61 acquisitions. We plan to continue to expand our business externally through similar acquisitions depending in part upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions, which may not be available to us, as well as sufficient funds from our cash on hand, cash flow from operations, existing debt facilities and additional indebtedness to fund these acquisitions. The number of acquisitions we pursue largely depends on the quality of the potential target and a key point of focus during our due diligence on a potential target, and the primary reason we decline to pursue a target after entering into a letter of intent, is the quality of the target’s client accounting. The success of our acquisition strategy depends on the ability of our senior management to identify suitable acquisition candidates, to accurately assess the value, strengths, weaknesses, contingent or other liabilities and potential profitability of such acquisition candidates, to obtain any necessary permits or approvals from regulatory bodies and to integrate the operations of such businesses once they are acquired. Our success in making additional acquisitions depends on the availability of, and competition for, suitable acquisition candidates. Further, we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions for many reasons, including any misjudgment of the key elements of an acquisition, quality of client accounting, competition among buyers, the high valuations of businesses in our industry, the need for regulatory and other approvals, lack of internal resources to actively pursue all attractive opportunities and availability of capital. Even after entering into a share purchase agreement, exclusivity agreement or letter of intent, there can be no assurance that such acquisition will close until such transactions are finalized, which may also impact the Adjusted EBITDA presented in this Offering Memorandum. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We present information _relating to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Revenues, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin and other non-IFRS measures in this Offering Memorandum; certain of the data used in calculating this information was unaudited or involved certain estimates and judgments, and accordingly you should not unduly rely on them.”_ When we do identify and complete acquisitions, we may face financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention and resources needed for existing operations, difficulty with integrating acquired businesses, acquiring businesses that are not consistent with our long-term strategies, integration of different corporate cultures, increased expenses, potential dilution of our brand, assumption of unknown liabilities, indemnities, potential disputes with the sellers and the need to evaluate the financial systems of and establish internal controls for acquired entities. We have historically financed acquisitions through a variety of sources, including our own cash reserves and debt financing. While we intend to continue to finance acquisitions from these sources in the future, we may have insufficient cash reserves to fund acquisitions, and adverse market conditions or other factors may prevent us from obtaining debt finance on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to implement our acquisition strategy, obtain sufficient financing or integrate acquired businesses successfully, our business and prospects for growth could be negatively affected. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and _Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Acquisitions and disposals.”_ ----- Given the various risks to which we are exposed and the uncertainties inherent in our business, we cannot guarantee the successful implementation of our acquisition strategies. Additionally, our strategies may put operational strain on our business and consume management time and focus to the detriment of our existing business operations. If we do not meet our strategic objectives or achieve the results initially expected, we may be unable to recover our investment or this may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may not realize the expected benefit of our past or future acquisitions or we may face unforeseen costs or liabilities. In the past, we have grown through a combination of organic development and bolt-on acquisitions, and we intend to continue this combination in the future. Growth through acquisitions entails certain risks, including the risk of a failure to realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions and incurrence of unexpected risks and obligations. Our ability to realize the benefits we anticipate from our acquisition activities, including any anticipated sales growth, cost synergies and other anticipated benefits, will depend in large part upon whether we are able to integrate such businesses efficiently and effectively. Integration is an ongoing process, and we may not be able to fully integrate such businesses smoothly or successfully, and the process may take longer than expected. Successful integration of acquired businesses will also depend on our ability to effect any required changes in operations or personnel and may require capital expenditures or the funding of unforeseen liabilities. The integration and operation of any future acquisitions may expose us to certain risks, including the following: liability related to the mishandling of customer cash accounts; difficulty in integrating the acquired businesses in a cost-effective manner, including the full integration of the acquired business account management into our IT system, management information and financial control systems; unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual, labor or other issues arising out of the acquisitions; significant unexpected liabilities or contingencies arising from the acquisitions; potential disruptions to our ongoing business caused by our senior management’s focus on the acquired companies; and post-acquisition performance not meeting our expectations or plans. We are required to have separate customer accounts in our Joint Property Management business, and if a target has poor customer accounting policies, it could lead to difficulties collecting customer balances or complying with applicable law. There can be no assurance that our future acquisitions will be made on appropriate terms or at an acceptable cost or can be successfully integrated with the rest of our businesses. A failure to identify appropriate acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our failure to realize the expected benefits or synergies of past or future acquisitions could result in the lack of implementation and achievement of our growth strategy may prevent us from obtaining the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create, or could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.",,,,N/A

For example, conflicts may arise from our position as broker to both landlords and tenants in residential real estate lease transactions or our Brokerage business could have inside information about a property or the property owner’s circumstances relative to other brokers as a result of our managing that property through our RRES business. In certain cases, we are also subject to fiduciary obligations to our customers. We have adopted various policies, controls and procedures to monitor, address and limit actual or perceived conflicts, such as an officer in charge of our risk management team, anti-bribery software, a whistleblower hotline and data compliance procedures, but these policies and procedures may not be adequate or may not be adhered to by our employees. Appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our reputation could be damaged and cause us to lose existing customers or fail to gain new customers if we fail, or appear to fail, to identify, disclose and appropriately address potential conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that in some jurisdictions, regulations could be changed to limit our ability to act for parties where conflicts exist even with informed consent, which could limit our market share in those markets. We cannot guarantee that future conflicts of interest will not cause material harm to us. -----",,,,N/A

It may be difficult for us or our agents (including real estate brokers and subcontractors hired by other third parties we engage) to regularly inspect such properties and manage the maintenance and upkeep on behalf of our customers and to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Additionally, we may find it difficult to manage tenants if they encounter difficulties with the properties they rent. For example, although there are certain basic necessities that must function properly, such as heat or water, we cannot force a landlord to comply with all tenant requests if they are not mandated by law. Therefore, a tenant may have an unfavorable view of us as property manager for unresolved requests that the landlord will not approve or if they are unhappy with the quality of work commissioned by the landlord, which can present a risk to our reputation. The occurrence of any such development could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. Our ability to perform the property management services will be affected by various factors, including, among other things, engaging the appropriate subcontractors, maintaining sufficient personnel and retaining key personnel at the number of our properties that we manage under our Lease Management and Renting and Joint Property Management businesses. No assurance can be made that we will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining skilled personnel, in integrating any new personnel into our organization or in engaging with the appropriate subcontractors at reasonable costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to successfully monitor our operations, costs, regulatory compliance and service quality and maintain other necessary internal controls.

Any cost savings, gains and synergies that we realize from these bolt-on acquisitions may differ materially from our estimates. The estimates contained herein are our current estimates, but they involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such estimates. Our ability to realize the expected cost savings, gains and synergies associated with the adjustments included when calculating Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and other non–IFRS financial measures depends on factors beyond our control, such as operating difficulties, increased operating costs, competitors and customers, delays in implementing initiatives and general economic or industry conditions. We may be required to make cash expenditures to achieve such cost savings, gains and synergies, and these costs are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA or Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. We cannot assure you that these cash expenditures to achieve such cost savings, gains and synergies will not be higher than we anticipated. In addition, we may not fully realize such cost savings, gains and synergies within 12 months of the completion of the respective acquisitions, and may not do so at all. Further, our churn rate in respect of the bolt-on acquisitions may be higher than expected. Accordingly, you should not view our presentation of this adjustment in our Adjusted EBITDA or Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as a projection that we will achieve these cost savings or gains. Our ability to realize these anticipated gains and synergies is subject to significant uncertainties and you should not place undue reliance on the adjustments in evaluating our anticipated results. In addition, any cost savings, gains and synergies that we realize may be offset, in whole or in part, by reductions in revenues, or through increases in other expenses, including as a result of the actions we take. For example, reducing sales, marketing and customer support could result in lower revenue and could lead to disruption of our operations, loss of or inability to recruit key personnel, decline in employee productivity, weakening of internal standards, controls or procedures, and impairment of key customer and supplier relationships.

Our ability to attract and retain customers is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, management, workplace culture, financial condition, our response to unexpected events and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters, even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct, could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential customers, which could make it difficult for us to attract new customers and maintain existing ones. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including the personal conduct of individuals associated with our brand, the handling of customer complaints, regulatory compliance, such as compliance with anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and corruption laws, the use and protection of customer and other sensitive information, and actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct. Social media channels can also cause rapid, widespread reputational harm to our brand. Our portfolio of brands and our reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside of our control. For example, any shortcoming of or controversy related to third-party providers, landlords or property owners may be attributed to us, thus damaging our reputation and the value of the affected brand and increasing the attractiveness of our competitors’ services. Also, business decisions or other actions or omissions of our shareholders or management may adversely affect the value of our investments, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, and otherwise damage our reputation and brands. Adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us.

We depend on our business relationships and our reputation to attract and retain customers. As a result, allegations against us, irrespective of the ultimate outcome of such allegations, may harm our professional reputation and as such materially damage our business and its prospects, in addition to any financial impact. As a licensed real estate broker and provider of commercial and residential real estate services, we, and our licensed professionals and independent contractors, are subject to statutory due diligence, disclosure and standard-of-care obligations. Failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us, our sales professionals or independent contractors to litigation from parties who purchased, sold or leased properties that we brokered or managed in the jurisdictions in which we operate.

These consumer organizations representing tenants are able to organize class actions in the real estate services market, which has been introduced by the French Hamon law, and file lawsuits on behalf of tenants. For example, we are currently involved in claims against us for alleged losses brought on behalf of lessees related to over charges for receiving notices to pay. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.” We could be subject to claims following the acquisition of a business or subject to audits and/or fines from various local real estate authorities or regulatory agencies if they determine that we are violating licensing laws or failing to follow certain laws, rules and regulations. In our residential property management business, we hire and supervise third-party contractors to provide services for our managed properties. We may be subject to claims for defects, negligent performance of work or other similar actions or omissions by third parties we do not control. Moreover, our customers may seek to hold us accountable for the actions of contractors because of our role as property or facilities manager or project manager, even if we have technically disclaimed liability as a contractual matter, in which case we may be pressured to participate in a financial settlement for purposes of preserving the customer relationship. We engage with subcontractors to provide a large number of building staff in facilities that we manage, and as a result, we face the risk of potential claims from such staff, such subcontractors. ----- We also face employment-related claims as an employer with respect to our corporate and other employees, for which we would bear ultimate responsibility in the event of an adverse outcome in such matters. We also face claims related to our franchisees, with respect to the termination of our franchise agreements and other claims which may arise related to such agreements. Adverse outcomes of property and facilities management disputes and related or other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, particularly to the extent we may be liable on our contracts, or if our liabilities exceed the amounts of the insurance coverage procured and maintained by us. Further, we face the risk of claims of illness or injury relating to premise liability given that we lease, manage and sell properties to our customers. Some of these litigation risks may be mitigated by the commercial insurance policies we maintain. However, in the event of a substantial loss or certain types of claims, our insurance coverage and/or self-insurance reserve levels might not be sufficient to pay the full damages. Additionally, in the event of grossly negligent or intentionally wrongful conduct, insurance policies that we may have may not cover us at all. Further, the value of otherwise valid claims held under insurance policies could become uncollectible in the event of the covering insurance company’s insolvency, although we seek to limit this risk by placing our commercial insurance only with highly rated companies. Any of these events could materially negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Finally, we are also subject, from time to time, to tax audits and challenges from relevant tax authorities. In this respect, two entities of the Foncia Group are currently undergoing tax audits run by the French tax authorities in respect of fiscal years 2016 to 2018 and 2016 to 2019 respectively.

Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays and loss, corruption or exposure of critical data or intellectual property or disruption of our ability to provide services to or interact with our customers, contractors and vendors, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel. We could also face difficulties in bringing the IT systems of the companies that we acquire up to the standard of our standard security procedures and protections, which could lead to interruptions or failures of our information systems. ----- Furthermore, any such event could result in substantial recovery and remediation costs and liability to customers, business partners and other third parties. We have business continuity and disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, but our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient and cannot account for all eventualities, and a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers, our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations, and as a result, our future operating results could be materially adversely affected. Our business relies heavily on the use of software and residential real estate data, some of which is purchased or licensed from third-party providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability. A disruption of our ability to access such software, including an inability to renew such licenses on the same or similar terms, or provide data to our professionals and/or our customers, contractors and vendors or an inadvertent exposure of proprietary data could damage our reputation and competitive position, and our operating results could be adversely affected.",,,,N/A

The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Security breaches and other disruptions of our information and technology networks could compromise our information and intellectual property and expose us to liability, reputational harm and significant remediation costs, which could cause material harm to our business and financial results. Unauthorized disclosure, modification or loss of confidential, personally identifiable or sensitive data or other operational failures may occur through a variety of methods. These include, but are not limited to, systems failures, in-house employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or unauthorized access to or through our information systems, whether by our in-house employees, vendors or third parties, or a cyber-attack by hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations. Information security risks have generally increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the internet, and the increased sophistication and activity of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, cybercriminals and other external parties, some of which may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Cybersecurity attacks are becoming more sophisticated and include malicious software, phishing and spear phishing attacks, wire fraud and payment diversion, account and email takeover attacks, ransomware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches. Cybersecurity attacks, including attacks that are not ultimately successful, could lead to disruptions in our critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information or corruption of our data, and could also substantially damage our reputation. We have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past, including ransomware attacks by cybercriminals, and we expect we may experience additional attacks in the future. Cybersecurity attacks like the ones we have experienced in the past could have a substantial impact on our reputation with our customers, and stakeholders, and may have a material adverse effect on our business. An incident involving disclosure, data modification, loss or security breach or a significant technical failure could subject us to significant monetary damages or losses, litigation, negative publicity, regulatory enforcement actions, and liability under our contracts, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Any person who circumvents our security measures could steal proprietary or confidential customer information or cause interruptions in our operations that could cause us to be unable to provide our services or operate our business, which could damage our reputation. We incur significant costs to protect against security breaches and other cybersecurity attacks and may incur significant additional costs to address issues caused by any such breaches or cybersecurity attacks. Our failure to prevent future security breaches or cybersecurity attacks, or wellpublicized security breaches affecting the internet in general, could significantly harm our reputation and business and financial results.",,,,N/A

Certain laws may also require us to protect the security of our employees’ personal data. In particular, we are subject to the stringent requirements of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), violation of which carries substantial fines and grants individual ----- data subjects the right to claim damages for rights violations. In addition, in connection with the processing of personal data, we are also subject to French law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 on information technology, data files and civil liberties as amended, which incorporates the provisions of the GDPR. A public authority, the French Data Protection Authority (Commission Nationale de l’informatique et des Libertés) (“CNIL”), is responsible for ensuring compliance with data protection regulations in France. We cannot ensure that the confidentiality of such data and information will not be breached as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise, or that doubts may not arise regarding the security of the data and information collected and managed by us. As a result of any continuing legislative initiatives and customer demands, we may have to modify our operations with the goal of further improving data security. The cost of compliance with these laws, regulations and standards is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any such modifications may result in increased expenses and operating complexity, and we may be unable to increase the rates we charge for our services sufficiently to offset these increases. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws, regulations and standards can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties. If customer confidential information or personal data that we maintain is inappropriately disclosed due to an information security breach, or if any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our confidentiality policies or other controls or procedures with which we are responsible for complying with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we may incur substantial liabilities to our customers and be subject to fines or penalties imposed by governmental authorities. Any incidents with respect to the handling of such information could subject us to litigation or indemnification claims with our customers and other parties and harm our reputation. In addition, any breach or alleged breach of our confidentiality agreements with our customers may result in termination of their engagements, resulting in associated loss of revenue and increased costs and have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.

We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality, license and other contractual agreements and patent, copyright, and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. For example, certain of our business units rely on proprietary software that we have developed internally or acquired, such as Millenium, or mobile apps developed as part of our digital initiatives strategy. Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing services and solutions similar to ours. Further, the steps we take may not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former in-house employees or other third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we cannot be sure that our services and solutions do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties. Third parties, including competitors, may assert intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or invalidity claims against us that could be upheld. Intellectual property litigation, which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us, may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights, including trade secrets or proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement or misappropriation of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of our or others’ intellectual property or proprietary rights. We may not prevail in any such litigation, and if we are unsuccessful, we may be subject to monetary liability and injunctive or equitable relief, which may prevent our use of others’ intellectual property or proprietary rights if we are not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all.

Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage. We may not be covered by insurance in specific instances, such as fire, explosions, natural disasters, water damage and terror attacks. While we seek to maintain ----- appropriate levels of insurance, not all claims are insurable, and we may experience major incidents of a nature not covered by insurance. Furthermore, our insurance costs may increase over time in response to any negative development in our claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance market in general. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.",,,,N/A

If we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us, or make incorrect determinations in complex tax regimes, we may incur significant financial penalties.","We are subject to numerous European, national and local laws and regulations specific to the services we perform in our businesses. Brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of valuation services requires us, and our employees, to maintain applicable licenses in certain countries in which we perform these services. If we, and our employees, fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities without a license, or violate any of the regulations regarding our licenses, we may be required to pay fines or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended, cancelled or revoked. In addition, the residential real estate industry and residential tenancies in particular remain heavily regulated and closely monitored by consumer watchdog organizations and associations that can organize class actions and file lawsuits on behalf of tenants. The latest major change came in 2014, with the introduction of the ALUR law, under which the French government introduced, among others, measures to protect individuals considering buying or renting an apartment within a professionally managed co-ownership building. A large amount of extra documentation is now required before the pre-contract (compromis de vente) can be signed, which increases the time between the initial offer and closing. We must comply with law No. 89-462 dated July 6, 1989, which grants residential tenants a statutory right of renewal and caps rents for vacant units and renewed leases at the amount of the last indexed rent paid by the previous tenant and/or of a reference rent determined by the decree. This law also restricts a limited number of landlords a right to recover service charges from tenants and requires residential leases to complete various reports on the environmental status of the property or technical features of the premises. In addition, we are prohibited by law in France from evicting tenants in winter, from November 1 to March 31 each year. In 2021, this period was extended in 2021 until May 31 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We must also comply with articles L.145-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, recently modified by law No. 2014-626 dated June 18, 2014 known as the Pinel Law, for premises leased to commercial tenants. The French commercial leases regime establishes various compulsory obligations establishing, amongst others, a minimum term of nine years, a tenant’s statutory right of renewal on lease expiry, a cap on renewed rents and a limitation on service charge recoverable from tenants. We are also subject to laws of broader applicability, such as tax, securities, environmental, employment laws, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and corruption laws, and occupational health and safety regulations. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of significant fines by governmental authorities, awards of damages to private litigants and significant amounts paid in legal fees or settlements of these matters. As the size and scope of our business has increased significantly during the past decade, both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous licensing and other regulatory requirements and the possible loss resulting from non-compliance have increased. The global economic crisis has resulted in increased government and legislative activities, including the introduction of new legislation and changes to rules and regulations, which we expect will continue into the future. New or revised legislation or regulations applicable to our business may have an adverse effect on our business, including increasing the costs of regulatory compliance or preventing us from providing certain types of services in certain jurisdictions or in connection with certain transactions or customers. For example, on May 25, 2018, GDPR became effective with a greater territorial reach than existing laws, and it applies to all of our contracts and agreements throughout Europe. As a result, we updated and continue to update certain agreements and data protection practices, which may take significant time and cost. We are unable to predict how new laws, rules, regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to laws or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future.

Changes in tax laws or regulations or to their interpretations could adversely affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments. Our tax returns and the tax treatment of our transactions are prepared in accordance with applicable tax legislation and prevailing case law. Certain tax positions we take are based on industry practice, tax advice we have received in some cases from third parties, and similarities to facts and circumstances described in case law. These positions may relate to tax compliance (especially in the current international tax context tending towards enhanced mandatory disclosure obligations), classification of income, treaty relief, withholding tax, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues, including tax base. It is possible that the tax authorities will not agree with the views we have taken. From time to time, we are subject to tax audits, and any challenges from relevant tax authorities with respect to our application and interpretation of tax rules may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, and such adjustments may not be favorable to us. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor, they could result in significant additional tax liabilities and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In particular, European, Luxembourg and French tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and are subject to varying interpretations. In this respect, an increase in administrative efforts within our business and an impact on existing structures may occur from the current incorporation into French and Luxembourg tax law of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (the “OECD”) principles related to base erosions and profit-shifting (“BEPS”) that were included in the final reports released by the OECD and the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS signed in Paris on June 7, 2017. The European Union intends to harmonize tax legislation of the Member States. In this respect, the Council of the European Union (the “Council of the European Union”) adopted a directive “laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market” on July 12, 2016 (Council Directive 2016/1164) (the “ATAD”). The ATAD was later amended on May 29, 2017 by the Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 (the “ATAD 2”), which, inter alia, extends the scope of the ATAD to hybrid mismatches involving third countries and provides that its provisions apply (subject to certain exceptions) from January 1, 2020. Among the set of measures, the ATAD provides for a general interest limitation rule pursuant to which the tax deduction of net financial expenses is limited to 30% of the taxpayer’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) or to a maximum amount of €3 million, whichever is higher (subject to several exceptions). Such rules apply from January 1, 2019 following their transposition into French tax law. The French Finance Law for 2020 (Law 2019-1479 of December 28, 2019) also introduced under French tax law the provisions of the ATAD 2 and thus repealed the existing French anti-hybrid rules, as set forth in Article 212-I-b of the French Code général des impôts (the “French Tax Code”). See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to _Each Series of Notes—French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a portion of the interest on our indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to service our indebtedness” for more details on these rules._ Furthermore, Article 108 of the 2019 French Finance Law introduced, under French tax law, the anti-abuse provision provided for by the ATAD with respect to French corporate income tax and aims to address abusive tax practices that are not dealt with by specifically targeted provisions. Pursuant to this provision, the French tax authorities may ignore an arrangement or a series of arrangements which are not genuinely taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances, having been put into place for the main purpose, or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the applicable tax law. While the ATAD was implemented into Luxembourg domestic law by the law of December 21, 2018 and entered into force on January 1, 2019, the ATAD 2 was implemented into Luxembourg domestic law by the law of December 20, 2019 and entered into force on January 1, 2020, save for the reverse hybrid mismatch rule, which will enter into force on January 1, 2022. ----- The European Commission has also published a corporate reform package proposal on October 25, 2016 including three new proposals that aim at (i) re-launching the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (“CCCTB”) which is a single set of rules to compute companies’ taxable profits in the EU, (ii) avoiding loopholes associated with profit-shifting for tax between EU countries and non-EU countries, and (iii) providing new dispute resolution rules to relieve problems with double taxation for businesses. The directive proposal on the CCCTB requires unanimity in the Council of the European Union for its adoption following consultation of the European Parliament (special legislative procedure), which gave its favorable vote on March 15, 2018. It is expected to be implemented in two steps, with the common base being implemented as a first step and consolidation being put in place swiftly afterwards. In this respect, the European Commission has published its work program for 2020, which indicates that the CCCTB should receive priority attention this year. Furthermore, additional rules on tax dispute resolution apply since January 1, 2019 following the transposition of Council Directive 2017/1852 of October 10, 2017 into French tax law as part of the 2019 French Finance Law. These regulations could impact our tax position in the future. Finally, since tax laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which the Group’s companies are located, or operate, or may be located, or may operate, may not always provide clear-cut or definitive guidelines, the tax regime applied to the Group’s operations, intra-group transactions or reorganizations (past or future) is or may sometimes be based on the Issuer’s interpretations of French, Luxembourg, or foreign tax laws and regulations. We cannot guarantee that such interpretations will not be questioned by the relevant tax authorities.

In addition, the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified support personnel in all areas of our business and IT personnel in particular. We and our competitors use equity incentives and sign-on and retention bonuses to help attract, retain and incentivize senior management. As competition is significant for the services of such personnel, the expense of such incentives and bonuses may increase, and we may be unable to attract or retain such personnel to the same extent that we have in the past.

Labor laws applicable to our business in certain countries, particularly France, are relatively rigorous. In numerous cases, labor laws provide for the strong protection of employees’ interests. In addition, some of our employees are members of unions or, based on applicable regulations, represented by work councils or other bodies. In many cases, we must inform, consult with and request the consent or opinion of union representatives or work councils in managing, developing or restructuring certain aspects of our business. These labor laws and consultative procedures could limit our flexibility with respect to employment policy or economic reorganization and could limit our ability to ----- respond to market changes efficiently. Even where consultative procedures are not mandatory, important strategic business decisions could be negatively received by some employees and employees’ representative bodies, which could lead to labor actions that could disrupt our business. Although we believe our relations with employees are good, our operations may nevertheless be materially affected by strikes, work stoppages, work-slowdowns or other labor-related developments in the future, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our employees in certain countries benefit from collective bargaining agreements, and we may not be able to periodically renegotiate collective agreements on acceptable terms. Settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, in Switzerland, we participate in employer pension plans which provide defined benefits to certain employees covered by labor contracts. These plans are not administered by us and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants.

Any changes in these accounting standards may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results from operations. In particular, there are a number of standards, amendments and interpretations which have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (the “IASB”) and IFRS standards are subject to change. Certain IFRS standards have been recently revised by the IASB. Notably, the effectiveness of IFRS 16 (Leases) from January 1, 2019 has an impact on the manner in which we carry out our financial reporting. The application of IFRS 16 has had, and will continue to have, an impact on our reported assets, liabilities and income statement as we will recognize new assets and liabilities for our operating leases. We chose to apply IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach with no restatement of comparative information, which means that our data for the year ended December 31, 2019 cannot be meaningfully compared with data for the year ended December 31, 2018. Under this approach, a liability is recognized at the transition date for the present value of any residual lease payments, against a right-of-use asset adjusted for the amount of any lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date. We have a large number of leases, primarily leases of property and vehicles, across our entire French and international branch network.

The degree to which we will be leveraged following completion of the Transactions could have important consequences for holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to: - making it more difficult for each Issuer and their subsidiaries to satisfy their respective obligations with respect to the Notes, the New Senior Credit Facilities and other debt and liabilities we may incur; - increasing our vulnerability, and reducing our flexibility to respond to general adverse economic and industry conditions; - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and development, or other general corporate purposes; - restricting us from pursuing acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities; - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive environment and the industry in which we operate; - negatively impacting credit terms with our suppliers and other creditors; - increasing our exposure to interest rate increases because some of our indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest; - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged; - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, capital expenditures, business opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and increasing the cost of any future borrowings; and - limiting our ability to obtain additional capacity for issuance of bid, advance payment, performance and warranty guarantees for operative business purposes and increasing the cost of any future guarantee issuances. Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our obligations, including under the Notes and the New Senior Credit Facilities.",,,,N/A

Following consummation of the Transactions, each Issuer will be dependent upon the cash flow from their respective operating subsidiaries in the form of dividends or other distributions or payments to meet their obligations, including their obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees. The amounts of dividends and distributions available to each Issuer will depend on the profitability and cash flows of their respective subsidiaries, and on the ability of each of those subsidiaries to declare dividends under applicable law or transfer profits under profit and loss transfer agreements, if applicable. Each Issuer’s subsidiaries, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to each Issuer to make payments in respect of their indebtedness, including the Notes and the Note Guarantees. Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases, may actually prohibit, the ability of these subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. In particular, the New Senior Credit Facilities and ----- the Senior Secured Notes limit the ability to upstream cash to the Senior Notes Issuer subject to certain exceptions. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation. Applicable law, as well as profit and loss transfer agreements between several entities of the Group, may also limit the amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prevent such payments. In particular, the ability of each Issuer’s respective subsidiaries to pay dividends to each Issuer will generally be limited to the amount of distributable reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay their respective debt when due. The subsidiaries of each Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes have no direct obligation to make payments with respect to the Notes or the Note Guarantees. While the Indentures limit the ability of each Issuer’s subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments, these limitations are subject to significant qualifications and exceptions, including exceptions for restrictions imposed by applicable law.",,,,N/A

The Indentures and the New Senior Credit Facilities Agreement also permit us to incur a substantial amount of indebtedness at subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes, and to incur indebtedness that shares in the Collateral or that benefits from security interests over assets that do not secure the Notes. Any debt that our subsidiaries incur could be structurally or effectively senior to the Notes to the extent that such subsidiaries do not guarantee the Notes such debt is secured by liens that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such property and assets securing such debt, and other debt could be secured or could mature prior to the Notes. Although the New Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the Indentures will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to each Issuer and its respective subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related risks that each Issuer faces would increase. In addition, the New Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and the Indentures will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants.”_ The covenants to which we will be subject could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. In addition, the New Senior Credit Facilities Agreement will require us to comply with certain affirmative covenants while amounts under the New Senior Credit Facilities remain outstanding. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the New Revolving Credit Facility under the New Senior Credit Facilities Agreement will require us to comply with a financial ratio, while amounts exceeding a certain threshold remain outstanding under the New Revolving Credit Facility.

In addition, a default under the New Senior Credit Facilities, including our failure to comply with the financial ratio under the New Revolving Credit Facility, could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions, including the Indentures. If our creditors, including the creditors under the New Senior Credit Facilities, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries that would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes.

In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay any portion or all of our debt.

Some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (the “Benchmarks Regulation”) applies, subject to certain transitional provisions, to the provision of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of a benchmark within the EU (which, for these purposes, includes the United Kingdom). Among other things, it (i) requires benchmark administrators to be authorized or registered (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regime or otherwise recognized or endorsed) and (ii) prevents certain uses by EU supervised entities of benchmarks of administrators that are not authorized or registered (or, if non-EU based, not deemed equivalent or recognized or endorsed). The Benchmarks Regulation could have a material impact on the New Senior Credit Facilities if the methodology or other terms of the benchmark are changed in order to comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation. Such changes could, among other things, have the effect of reducing, increasing or otherwise affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the relevant benchmark. More broadly, any of the international or national reforms, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks, could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a benchmark and complying with any such regulations or requirements. Specifically, the sustainability of LIBOR has been questioned as a result of the absence of relevant active underlying markets and possible disincentives (including possibly as a result of benchmark reforms) for market participants to continue contributing to such benchmarks. The UK Financial Conduct Authority has indicated through a series of announcements that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Separately, the euro risk free rate working group for the euro area has published a set of guiding principles and high level recommendations for fallback provisions in, amongst other things, new euro denominated cash products (including bonds) referencing EURIBOR. The guiding principles indicate, among other things, that continuing to reference EURIBOR in relevant contracts (without robust fallback provisions) may increase the risk to the euro area financial system. It is not possible to predict with certainty whether, and to what extent, LIBOR and EURIBOR will continue to be supported going forward. This may cause LIBOR and EURIBOR to perform differently than in the past, and may have other consequences which cannot be predicted., Such factors may have (without limitation) the following effects on certain benchmarks: (i) discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to a benchmark; (ii) triggering changes in the rules or methodologies used in the benchmark; and/or (iii) leading to the disappearance of the benchmark. Any of the above changes or any other consequential changes as a result of international or national reforms or other initiatives or investigations, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the interest we pay on borrowings under the New Senior Credit Facilities. To the extent that interest rates were to increase significantly, our interest expense could correspondingly increase, thereby reducing our cash flow. -----",,,,N/A

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture also permits the Senior Secured Notes Collateral to secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will only enforce the Senior Secured Notes Collateral as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. Prior to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer designating any liabilities as Super Senior Liabilities in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (the “Designation Date”), the Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that consists of the holders of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes, the senior lenders, creditors in respect of indebtedness ranking pari passu with the senior creditors and creditors in respect of certain non-priority hedging obligations (the “Senior Secured Credit Participations”) which aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations at that time (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”) (in each case, acting through their respective creditor representatives). If the Majority Senior Secured Creditors do not instruct the Security Agent to enforce, or instruct the Security Agent to cease enforcing the transaction security, then, in certain cases, creditors holding more than 50% of the total second lien credit participations (or, in certain cases, creditors holding 50% of the total topco credit participations) may instruct the Security Agent to enforce. Following the Designation Date, the Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that may consist of either (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or (ii) creditors holding more than 50% of the total participations in Super Senior Liabilities at that time (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”). The Security Agent is required to act in accordance with instructions received from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, however: (i) if and to the extent the obligations under the Super Senior Liabilities have not been fully and finally discharged within six months of enforcement instructions first being issued by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors; or (ii) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of enforcement instructions first being issued by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors, then the enforcement instructions provided by the Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail.

In connection with any enforcement instructions received by it, the Security Agent may request security and/or indemnity and/or prefunding satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense (including legal fees). To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes (such as indebtedness under the New Senior Credit Facilities Agreement), the voting interest of holders of Senior Secured Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we incur. The creditors of any Super Senior Liabilities may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Senior Secured Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells Senior Secured Notes Collateral consisting of the shares of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Note Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such entities securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees may be released.

The pledges over financial securities (whether in the form of a pledge over a financial securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) of French companies may be enforced at the option of the secured creditor, either by a sale of the pledged financial securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors), by judicial foreclosure (attribution _judiciaire) or by contractual foreclosure (attribution conventionnelle or pacte commissoire) of the financial_ securities to the secured creditor, following which the secured creditor becomes the legal owner of the pledged financial securities. In a proceeding for attribution judiciaire or attribution conventionnelle, an expert is appointed (whether contractually or by the court) to value the collateral (in this case, the pledged financial securities), and if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt under the pledge, the secured creditor is required to pay the relevant pledgor a soulte equal to the difference between the value of the financial securities and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent sale of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. Also, if the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether an attribution judiciaire or an _attribution conventionnelle), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the_ foreclosed financial securities. Consequently, in the event the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf as well as on behalf of the lenders under the New Senior Credit Facilities and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, or as creditor of the parallel debt) decides to, and is entitled to, enforce the financial securities pledges through a judicial or contractual foreclosure and if the value of such financial securities exceeds the amount of the secured debt under the pledge, the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf as well as for the benefit of the lenders under the New Senior Credit ----- Facilities and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, or as creditor of the parallel debt) may be required to pay to the relevant pledgor a soulte equal to the value by which such financial securities exceeds the amount of secured debt under the pledge. If the value of such financial securities is less than the amount of the secured debt under the pledge, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditor will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such financial securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditor will be unsecured. If the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf as well as on behalf of the lenders under the New Senior Credit Facilities and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, or as creditor of the parallel debt) declines to request the judicial or contractual foreclosure of the financial securities, a sale of the pledged financial securities could be undertaken by public auction in accordance with applicable law. Due to the French regulatory restrictions set forth in the immediately following risk factor, the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf as well as on behalf of the lenders under the New Senior Credit Facilities and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, or as creditor of the parallel debt) is likely to have an incentive to enforce the pledged financial securities through a public auction. Since public auction procedures are not designed for a sale of a business as a going concern (as the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies), it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the Group as a going concern.",,,,N/A

The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, ----- whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers. The shares and other Senior Secured Notes Collateral that will be pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Senior Secured Notes, in part because most of such collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, such as France, include restrictions on persons who may hold certain of our licenses, authorizations and consents that are necessary to operate our business. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security Documents, enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets do not secure the Senior Secured Notes and it is possible that the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Senior Secured Notes Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged, because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Senior Secured Notes, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, holders of such Senior Secured Notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Senior Secured Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral.",,,,N/A

Such debt includes the guarantees of the Senior Secured Notes or, in the case of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, and the obligations under the New Senior Credit Facilities. Although the Senior Notes Indenture will contain restrictions on the ability of the Guarantors to incur additional debt, any additional debt incurred may be substantial and rank senior to the Senior Notes Guarantees. Upon any payment or distribution to creditors of a Guarantor under the Senior Notes Indenture in respect of an insolvency event, the holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor will be entitled to be paid in full from the assets of such Guarantor before any payment may be made pursuant to such Senior Notes Guarantees. Until the senior ranking debt of such Guarantor is paid in full, any distribution to which holders of the Senior Notes would be entitled, but for the subordination provisions included in the Intercreditor Agreement, shall instead be made to holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor as their interests may appear. As a result, in the event of insolvency of a Guarantor under the Senior Notes Indenture, holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor may recover more, ratably, than the holders of Senior Notes, in respect of the Guarantor’s Senior Notes Guarantees. In addition, the subordination provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the Senior Notes Guarantees will provide: - customary turnover provisions (relating to certain specified amounts) by the Trustee and the holders of the Senior Notes for the benefit of the holders of senior ranking debt of such Guarantor; - that if a payment default on any senior ranking debt of a Guarantor has occurred and is continuing, Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of its Senior Notes Guarantees until such default is cured or waived; - that if any other default occurs and is continuing on any designated senior ranking indebtedness that permits the holders thereof to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee receives a notice of such default, such Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of the Senior Notes, or pursuant to its Senior Notes Guarantees, until (among others) the earlier of the waiver or cure of such default and 179 days after the date on which the applicable payment blockage notice is received; and - that the holders of the Senior Notes and the Trustee are prohibited, without the prior consent of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors, from taking any enforcement action in relation to such guarantee, except in certain circumstances. The Senior Notes Indenture will also provide that, except under very limited circumstances, only the Trustee will have standing to bring an enforcement action in respect of the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees. Moreover, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Notes Indenture will restrict the rights of holders of the Senior Notes to initiate insolvency proceedings or take legal actions against each of the Guarantors under the Senior Notes Indenture, and by accepting any Senior Note, each such holder will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Senior Notes will have limited remedies and recourse under the Senior Notes Guarantees in the event of a default by the Senior Notes Issuer or a Guarantor under the Senior Notes Indenture.",,,,N/A

The value of such assets and property could be significant.

In particular, the French bankruptcy laws and regulations are unfavorable to creditors in many respects. In the event that any one or more of each Issuer’s, the Guarantors or any other of each Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against each Issuer, the enforceability of a Note Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the Security Interests. In certain circumstances, the court may also void the Security Interest or the Note Guarantee if the company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Note Guarantee or the Security Interests provided by such Guarantor; - direct that each Issuer and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes return any amounts paid under a Note Guarantee or any Security Interest to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to you. If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Note Guarantee or Security Interest is found to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee or the Security Interests will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors under the Security Documents (as defined herein) will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire Note Guarantee or Security Interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See also “—The Notes and the Note Guarantees may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations _or defenses that may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.”_ In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Note Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests created, the Guarantor: - issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its insolvency; - issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent businessman as a shareholder of such Guarantor would have contributed equity to such Guarantor or where the relevant beneficiary of the Note Guarantee or Security Interest knew or should have known that the Guarantor was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made; or - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Note Guarantee or Security Interest on the basis that the Note Guarantee or Security Interest were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly for the Guarantor’s benefit, or on some other basis and: (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Note Guarantee or the creation of the Security Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii) ----- was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s assets were unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due. Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Note Guarantee or created any Security Interest if: - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute. Although we believe we are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” as of the date the Note Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Note Guarantee was issued or the Security Interests were created, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

The obligations of the Guarantors incorporated in France and the enforcement of each such Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Note Guarantee is not in the relevant Guarantor’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Note Guarantee exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor, or such Note Guarantee would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. An increase in the amount of debt that benefits from such Note Guarantee without a corresponding increase in the amount of the Note Guarantee will dilute the value of such Note Guarantee to its beneficiaries, including the holders of the Notes. Accordingly, enforcement of any such Note Guarantee against the relevant Guarantor would be subject to certain defenses available to guarantors generally or, in some cases, to limitations contained in the terms of the Note Guarantees designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant Guarantors. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance and regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its Note Guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law applicable to it. Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing, or providing security in relation to, indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition. Under French corporate benefit rules, a court could declare any guarantee or security unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, or any proceeds have been obtained from the enforcement of any security, require that the recipient return the payment or any proceeds so obtained to the relevant guarantor or security provider, if the court found that the French Guarantor or security provider did not receive some real and adequate corporate benefit from the transaction involving the grant of the guarantee or ----- security as a whole. Existence of corporate benefit is a factual matter which must be determined on a case-bycase basis. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the Guarantor or security provider and whether the amounts guaranteed or secured are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance. In addition, each of the Note Guarantees and Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security provider under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Note Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Note Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or such Note Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. In particular, enforcement of any such Note Guarantee or Collateral against the relevant Guarantor or security provider would be subject to certain contractual limitations (so called “limitation language”) contained in the respective Indentures (or any other document governing the Note Guarantees) and Security Documents, respectively, designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant Guarantor or security provider. As a result, a Guarantor’s or security provider’s liability under its Note Guarantee or Collateral could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law and contractual enforcement restrictions applicable to it. This could lead to a situation in which such Note Guarantee or Collateral cannot be enforced at all. It is possible that a Guarantor or security provider, or any of their creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s guarantee or the security provider’s Collateral on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Note Guarantee or Collateral should be limited or voided. To the extent that any limitations on the relevant Note Guarantees or Collateral apply the Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or security provider, including trade payables of such Guarantor or security provider. Future Note Guarantees and Collateral may be subject to similar limitations. It is possible that a Guarantor, or a creditor of a Guarantor, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s guarantee on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Note Guarantee should be limited or voided. To the extent that agreed limitations on the Note Guarantee obligation apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, including trade payables of such Guarantor. Future guarantees may be subject to similar limitations. Moreover, an increase in the amount of debt that benefits from such Guarantee without a corresponding increase in the amount of the Note Guarantee will dilute the value of such Note Guarantee to its beneficiaries, including the holders of the Notes.

Interests in the global Notes will trade in book-entry form only, and Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive registered Notes, will be issued in exchange for book-entry interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global notes ----- representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the global notes representing the Notes will be made to the paying agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the global Notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, the Issuers will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and if investors are not participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indentures. Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon the Issuers’ solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent it has received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis. Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indentures, unless and until definitive registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry interests, they will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes. See “Book-Entry; _Delivery and Form.”_",,,,N/A

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary of the Issuers becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction: - the creditors of the Issuers and the Guarantors (including the holders of the Notes) will have no right to proceed against the assets of such non-Guarantor subsidiary; and - creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any) will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before the Issuers or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder (as applicable), will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary. ----- As such, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and any preferred stockholders (if any) of the non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuers.

The directors and executive officers of the Non-US Obligors are non-residents of, and substantially all of their assets are located outside of, the United States. Although the Non-US Obligors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under US securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors and executive officers of Non-US Obligors. In addition, as a substantial portion of the assets of the Non-US Obligors and their subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them judgments obtained in US courts. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the US Supreme Court, actions of the Non-US Obligors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of foreign jurisdictions would enforce: (i) judgments of United States courts obtained against the Non-US Obligors and the directors and executive officers who are not residents of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States federal and state securities laws or (ii) in original actions brought in such foreign jurisdictions against us or such persons predicated upon the United States federal and state securities laws.

In such a situation, the Issuers may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Notes that are tendered under any such offer. If a significant principal amount of Notes is tendered, the Issuers will likely have to obtain financing to pay for the tendered Notes. However, the Issuers may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A change of control may also result in a mandatory prepayment under the New Senior Credit Facilities Agreement and agreements governing any future indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of such indebtedness. Any failure by the Issuers to offer to purchase the Notes upon a change of control would constitute a default under the Indentures, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the New Senior Credit Facilities Agreement. The change of control provision contained in the Indentures may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers, recapitalizations or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a change of control as defined in the Indentures.

In this respect, French case law has developed the concept of “abnormal act of management,” according to which the expenses incurred by a French company, in relation with transactions that are not aligned with its direct corporate interest, are not tax deductible. ----- Under Article 39-1-3 of the French Tax Code, interest paid by an entity to its direct shareholders who are not related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code are tax deductible only up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate referred to in Article 39-1-3 of the French Tax Code (i.e., the annual average of the average effective floating rates on bank loans to companies with an initial maturity exceeding two years). Under Article 212 I-(a) of the French Tax Code, interest incurred on loans granted by related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code is deductible up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate referred to in Article 39-1-3 of the French Tax Code or, if higher, up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate that the borrowing entity could have obtained from independent financial credit institutions in similar circumstances. Pursuant to Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code, two entities will be regarded as related if (i) one of the entities holds directly or indirectly the majority of the other entity’s share capital or actually exercises the power of decision in that entity or (ii) both entities are placed under the conditions defined in (i) to the control of a same third entity. In both cases (i.e., non-deductibility under Article 39-1-3 and 212 I-(a) of the French Tax Code), non-deductible interest might be re-characterized as constructive dividends pursuant to Articles 109 et seq. of the French Tax Code, which may be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code, at (i) the standard corporate income tax rate set forth in the first sentence of the second paragraph of Article 219 I of the French Tax Code (i.e., 26.5% for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2021 and 25% for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2022) for payments benefiting legal persons or (ii) the rate of 75% for payments made in non-cooperative jurisdictions within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code other than those mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of the same Article 238-0 A (subject in any case to more favorable provisions of an applicable double tax treaty). Pursuant to Article 212 bis of the French Tax Code, the deductibility of net financial expenses incurred by an entity in respect of a given fiscal year is limited to the higher of (i) €3 million (to be adjusted on a prorata _temporis basis for fiscal years which do no last 12 months) and (ii) 30% of its adjusted EBITDA in the same_ fiscal year (corresponding to its taxable income before offset of carry forward tax losses and without taking into consideration net financial expenses and, to some extent, depreciation, provisions and capital gains/losses) generated by such entity (the “30% Limitation”). Such limitation applies to both related-party and third-party financings regardless of the purpose of these financings, subject to certain limited exceptions. Furthermore, for entities being part of a group that files eligible consolidated financial statements, a safeguard clause has been implemented in order to partially exempt companies that are able to demonstrate that the ratio of their own funds over their total assets is equal to or higher than the same ratio computed at the level of the accounting consolidated group to which they belong. In this specific case, net financial expenses exceeding the 30% Limitation are deductible up to 75% of their amount. French thin-capitalization rules apply in respect of loans granted by related parties. Where the amount of the related party debt of a company exceeds a ratio equal to 1.5 time the company’s own funds, the deduction of net financial expenses borne by such entity is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 30% of its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €3 million, multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by non-related parties (directly or indirectly) within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code increased by 1.5 time the company’s own funds (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said year. The balance of net financial expenses is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 10% of its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €1 million multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by related parties (directly or indirectly) within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code exceeding 1.5 time the company’s own funds (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said fiscal year. However, the interest deductibility limitation provided for by these amended thin-capitalization rules does not apply if the borrowing company demonstrates that the overall indebtedness ratio of the group as determined under accounting consolidation rules (i.e., the ratio existing between the total amount of the consolidated group’s debts (with the exception of those owed to companies belonging to the consolidated group) and the amount of the consolidated group’s own funds) to which it belongs is higher than or equal to its own indebtedness ratio (i.e., the ratio existing between the total amount of its debts and the amount of its own funds). Financial expenses that are disallowed pursuant to the 30% Limitation can be carried forward indefinitely and deducted in the future under the same conditions. On the other hand, the portion of financial expenses which tax ----- deduction is disallowed as a result of the application of the €1 million threshold or 10% limitation is only eligible for carry-forward for one-third of its amount. The unused interest deduction capacity of a current fiscal year may also be used over the five following fiscal years, but only against financial expenses incurred in respect of those fiscal years, it being noted that this measure is not available to thinly capitalized entities. Specific rules apply to companies that belong to French tax consolidated groups, i.e., mainly (i) the 30% Limitation is computed on the basis of the consolidated adjusted EBITDA generated by such companies and (ii) the 1.5 debt-to-own funds ratio is analyzed (x) on a consolidated basis pursuant to French accounting rules applying for purposes of establishing consolidated financial statements and (y) in respect of loans granted by related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code which do not belong to the same tax consolidated group. These thin-capitalization rules could apply at the level of the Issuer (in respect of any loans contracted by the Issuer from any related party) and at the level of the Issuer’s French subsidiaries that do not belong to the same French tax consolidated group as the Issuer with respect to any amount of the proceeds of the Notes used by the Issuer to grant intragroup loans to such subsidiaries as well as, more generally, in respect of any loans contracted by the Issuer’s French subsidiaries from any related party. Pursuant to the Bulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques-Impôts BOI-IS-BASE-35-40-10-20, § 20, dated May 13, 2020 and BOI-IS-BASE-35-40-20, § 240, dated May 13, 2020, the portion of interest that is not deductible by virtue of (i) Article 212 bis, I of the French Tax Code under the 30% Limitation and/or (ii) Article 212 bis, VII of the French Tax Code under the thin-capitalization rules is not to be recharacterized as a “deemed distribution” pursuant to Articles 119 et seq. of the French Tax Code and, therefore, is not subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code. Finally, the French Finance Law for 2020 includes specific provisions which implement into French tax legislation the provisions of the ATAD 2 in relation to hybrid mismatches with third countries, which would be applicable as from January 1, 2020, except for certain of its provisions which would be applicable as from January 1, 2022. In relation to such implementation, the provisions of Article 212-1-(b) of the French Tax Code (i.e., the former French anti-hybrid provisions) have been repealed. Articles 205 B et seq. of the French Tax Code implementing ATAD 2 provide limitations on interest deductions in the event of (i) a deduction of a payment at the level of a paying entity without a corresponding inclusion of such payment in the taxable income of the receiving entity (referred to as a “deduction without inclusion”), or (ii) a deduction of the same payment, operational expenses or losses in the taxable income of both the paying and receiving entity (referred to as a “double deduction”). Such limitations only apply to payments taking place between “associated enterprises,” except for the so-called “structured arrangements” (i.e., an arrangement pricing the relevant mismatch or an arrangement designed to produce the mismatch, subject to certain conditions). If the hybrid mismatch results in a deduction without inclusion, the deduction from taxable income will generally be denied to the French paying entity. Alternatively, the payment to a French receiving entity will be included in its taxable income if deduction is not denied in the jurisdiction of the paying entity. If the hybrid mismatch results in a double deduction, the deduction will either be denied at the level of the receiving entity or at the level of the paying entity. In respect of fiscal years opened as from January 1, 2022, these provisions also cover reverse hybrid entities, referring to situations where an entity is deemed to be tax transparent by the Member State in which it is incorporated or established but the jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which its “associated enterprises” holding directly or indirectly in aggregate an interest in 50% or more of its voting rights, capital interests or rights to share profit are established, qualify the entity as non-transparent. Where a hybrid entity of a reverse hybrid mismatch is incorporated or established in France, its income is, as the case may be, either subject to French corporate income tax or taxable pursuant to the conditions provided for by Article 8 of the French Tax Code, to the extent that it is not taxed in another State. The abovementioned tax rules may limit our ability to deduct interest accrued on our indebtedness incurred in France and, as a consequence, may increase our tax burden, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and reduce the cash flow available to service our indebtedness. -----",,,,N/A
130,Final Offerings 2021.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.5,Risks Relating to Each Series of Notes,1.5.24,The proposed financial transactions tax (FTT) may apply and impact dealings in the Notes.,"On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s Proposal”) for a Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (together, except for Estonia, the “Participating Member States”) and which, if enacted and implemented by France, should replace the French FTT. Following the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (the “ECOFIN”) meeting of December 8, 2015, Estonia officially announced its withdrawal from the negotiations and, on March 16, 2016, completed the formalities required to leave the enhanced cooperation on FTT. The Commission’s Proposal has a very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. At the ECOFIN meeting of June 14, 2019, a state of play of the work on the FTT was presented on the basis of a note prepared by Germany on June 7, 2019, indicating a consensus among the Participating Member States to continue negotiations on the basis of a joint French-German proposal based on the French financial transactions tax model which in principle would only concern shares of listed companies whose head office is in a Member State of the European Union. However, such proposal is still subject to change until a final approval. The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States, the scope of such tax being therefore uncertain. The timing of its implementation remains also unclear. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate and Participating Member States may decide to withdraw. Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT. -----",,,,N/A

130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.1.1,"The success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and, accordingly, our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by economic slowdowns, liquidity pressure, fiscal or political uncertainty and possible subsequent declines in property sales and leasing activities in one or more of the geographies or industry sectors that we serve.","Demand for our residential and commercial real estate services is sensitive to changes in the level of economic activity and economic conditions in the countries, regions and sectors in which we operate. Periods of economic weakness or recession, rising interest rates, fiscal or political uncertainty, market volatility, declining employment levels, declining demand for residential or commercial real estate, falling real estate values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur, may negatively affect the performance of our business. In addition, any of these events may have a direct impact on our ability to collect payments that we are owed under our rent payment guarantee (“Garantie de loyers impayés”) and occupancy guarantee (“Garantie d’occupation”), which we offer to certain residential landlords and lessors, respectively. See “—Low _demand for housing generally or lease terminations and/or tenant defaults could adversely affect our fees and the income produced by the properties we manage, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.”_ The outbreak of the war in Ukraine in February 2022, global supply chain disruptions and other geopolitical conflicts have caused an immediate impact on global economic conditions. Such conditions have resulted in shortages in materials and services and have led to increased inflationary pressure in 2022, including increases in the price for goods and services, including energy prices. Although we do not have direct economic activities in Russia and Ukraine and currently the conflict has not had any material impact on our overall revenue and EBITDA, it is difficult to predict the scope and extent of any potential impact of the increasing tensions and other geopolitical conflicts could have on our operations. Continuing increases in inflation could also impact the rate of rent payment default in the properties we service or the overall demand for and costs of our services and the margins we are able to realize on our services. For example, we estimate that the negative impact from elevated levels of inflation on EBITDA for our French business in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was approximately €2.5 million. Additionally, inflationary pressures in the labor markets in which we have operations could cause our personnel costs, which represented 51.4% of our revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, excluding employees in our headquarters, to increase. Although we anticipate that in 2023, our personnel costs should be moderately higher in France and in other countries, we expect that the impact of such increase may be partially offset due to price increases in our stock businesses, which are contractually guaranteed in France and negotiable in other countries. We also expect to benefit from the impact of higher interest rates on some of our clients’ bank deposits as a result of the continuing interest raises, and from inflationary price increases built into our management fees in the UK. However, governments may also cap increases in rent, such as France’s recent decision ----- in August 2022 to cap increases in rent by 3.5%, which may limit our ability to pass through inflationary pressures to our customers. Policy responses to inflation, such as increases to central bank policy rates in respect of the currencies with which we conduct our operations or in which our outstanding debt is denominated, may also impact our business, for example, by causing credit conditions to tighten (and adversely affecting the real estate markets in which we operate) or by increasing the costs of our debt service obligations, to the extent we have outstanding debt with a floating rate of interest. See “—Risks Relating to our Capital Structure— _The Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, thereby increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow.” These inflationary pressures, individually and in_ combination, have had, and are expected to continue to have, a limited impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our results of operations are also significantly impacted by economic trends, government policies and the real estate markets in the countries in which we operate. These include the following: overall economic activity, changes in interest rates, the impact of tax and regulatory policies, the cost and availability of credit and the geopolitical environment. The performance of our RRES services depends on our ability to collect fixed fees, charge variable fees for ancillary services, find tenants to bill transaction fees and collect rents. Our Joint Property Management business model is composed of fixed fees and variable fees related to additional services that could decline due to adverse economic conditions or administrative restrictions such as pandemic lockdowns. Additionally, the revenue derived from the Lease Management side of our Lease Management and Letting business is generally based on a percentage of rent collections from the properties we manage and, with respect to the renting side of the Lease Management and Letting business, from the one-off fees we receive for each new lease agreement entered into by our customers. The revenue generated by our business can be affected by many factors, including: (i) the magnitude of defaults by tenants under their respective leases, which may increase during distressed economic conditions; (ii) real estate and financial market conditions prevailing generally and regionally; (iii) our ability to attract and retain creditworthy tenants, particularly during economic downturns; (iv) the impact of inflationary pressures and cost of living on our tenants, which could contribute to increasing defaults or could cause tenants to trade down to lower rents; and (v) a decrease in the rate of tenants moving and a corresponding decrease in the one-off fees we receive for new lease agreements entered into by our customers. If tenants are unable to pay their rents, we are unable to collect the fees that are typically directly deducted from these rental payments. Additionally, if the cost of our services increases, customers may switch to other, lower-cost real estate services providers. Adverse economic conditions or political or regulatory uncertainty could also impact our Brokerage business as it may lead to a decline in property sales and/or a reduction in sales prices, which in turn could reduce the commissions and fees that we earn in brokering such transactions. Economic, political and regulatory uncertainty, as well as significant changes and volatility in the financial markets, business environment and the global landscape, make it increasingly difficult for us to predict our future financial performance. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of _Operations—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Macroeconomic and market conditions.”_ The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union, which occurred on January 31, 2020 following a national referendum in June 2016 (“Brexit”), has created lingering uncertainty about the future relationship among the UK, one of our current markets, and the EU and its remaining member states and may constitute an additional risk for the financial markets and the European economy. While the European Union and the United Kingdom agreed a comprehensive, zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade agreement, which came into force provisionally on January 1, 2021, Brexit has led to increased customs, health and safety checks at the borders of the UK and the EU as well as a lack of haulage and other qualified supply chain and logistics workers, which has delayed and disrupted the movement of goods between the EU and the UK. As a result, Brexit may affect our level of revenues and EBITDA in the United Kingdom, particularly with ----- respect to the FirstPort business. Moreover, fluctuations in the exchange rates used to convert the financial statements of FirstPort denominated in a British pound sterling as part of the consolidation process might significantly affect results of operations, net financial debt, and consolidated net assets in the financial statements. See also “—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Fluctuations in _exchange rates may adversely affect our business and results of operations.” Given the lack of_ comparable precedent, it is unclear what long-term financial, trade and legal implications Brexit will have and whether, and to what extent, our business could be affected. In addition, certain political parties in Scotland are currently pushing for a second referendum on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom, which may lead to additional uncertainty and may affect our business activities in Scotland and other parts of the United Kingdom. Any of the foregoing risks, if they were to occur, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",,,,N/A
130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.1.2,"The COVID-19 pandemic, including the resulting global economic uncertainty and the related lockdown measures, in particular its effects in France, Switzerland, Benelux, Germany and the UK where we have material operations, or other epidemics or pandemics, have had in the past, and could have in the future, a significant adverse impact on our business.","The COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence of variants such as Delta and Omicron and related sub-variants, and the rapidly evolving reactions of authorities, including those in France, Switzerland, Benelux, Germany and the UK, to contain the spread and address the impact of COVID-19 have had significant direct and indirect effects on businesses and commerce generally, including disruptions to supply chain, workforce, transactional activity, facility operation and production. While restrictions on the conduct of business in many jurisdictions, including the closure of workplaces determined to be non-essential, have eased or been lifted, there remain certain restrictions on the international, national and local movement of people and goods, which continue to disrupt many of our clients’ business operations and their recruitment needs. The extent and scope of such restrictions continue to be highly uncertain and subject to change, and stricter measures could potentially be put in place in the future. A prolonged continuance of this public health crisis could therefore have a material adverse effect, including materially increased volatility in financial markets and significant worsening of the global, European, French, UK, Belgian, German, Dutch, Swiss and Luxembourgish macroeconomic outlooks. Although there was no meaningful impact from the COVID-19 pandemic in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we cannot predict the impact that any future developments relating to it may have on our business. These developments may include, but are not limited to, the duration and spread of COVID-19, its severity, emergence of new variants and further actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, including the rate of deployment of vaccines. A number of measures taken by governments in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic intended to mitigate the spread of COVID19 caused significant effects on our business, including decreased demand for our services as a result of the slowdown in the European economies in which we operate and our inability to offer certain services as a result of government lockdown measures. In accordance with the decisions taken by most European governments in order to comply with social distancing recommendations, all premises (branches and head offices) were closed to the public during the lockdown periods in France, Switzerland, Benelux, Germany and the UK in the spring of 2020 (the “first lockdown”), as well as to employees (barring exceptional cases). During that period, real estate agents were barred from traveling to sign mandates or show properties and notaries were closed, which prevented any brokerage transactions from closing. For further discussion on notary execution, see “Regulation—France— _Hoguet.” Moving into new premises during this period was particularly complicated, as only moves_ that could not be postponed could be carried out, which resulted in reduced letting fees for the period. The first lockdown measures imposed on the French, Swiss, German and Belgian population also negatively impacted our fee collection with an increasing number of residential and commercial tenants not being able to pay their rent on time or at all, although the rents remained owed as a matter of law. The lease management market was also affected as we collect a portion of rents via check, and there were disruptions with postal service, which led to delays in sending and receiving invoices and fees. ----- Softer lockdowns were introduced again in the autumn of 2020 and spring 2021 which also led to the closure of all of our branches to the public in France which adversely impacted our ability to deliver our services. In addition, the lockdowns and related restrictions caused us to pause for a short period of time the roll-out of Millenium, our new ERP system, in 2020. However, we were able to subsequently resume the roll-out, which is now proceeding according to schedule.

130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.1.3,"We have numerous local, regional and national competitors across all of our businesses and the geographies that we serve, and further industry consolidation, fragmentation or innovation could lead to significant future competition.","We compete across a variety of businesses within the residential and commercial property services industry, including management of jointly owned properties, rental management and lettings, property transaction intermediation, specialized property insurance brokerage, technical due diligence and inventories and consulting services for commercial and office properties, business-specific IT services, marketing of properties by blocks or lots and technical maintenance. Although we are the global leading provider of residential real estate services, our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies and businesses. Depending on the geography, property type or business, we face competition from other residential or commercial real estate services providers and investment firms, in-house corporate real estate departments, developers, institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, investment managers, accounting firms and consulting firms. Some of these firms may have greater financial resources allocated to a particular geography, property type or business than we have allocated to that geography, property type or business. In addition, future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other new competitors or further consolidation of the industry. For example, increased regulation following the implementation of the 2014 French access to housing and urban renovation law, l’accès au logement et un urbanisme rénové (“ALUR law”), and the increasing need to invest in the digitization of services has led to the increased consolidation of a highly fragmented market. For further discussion on the ALUR law, see “Regulation—France—ALUR.” Reaching critical scale is important for the digitization and industrialization of processes in order to reduce costs and improve customer service. Our industry is highly fragmented among regional, local and boutique providers. Although many of our existing competitors are local or regional firms that are smaller than we are, some of these competitors are larger or have a stronger presence on a local or regional basis or in their primary markets. We are further subject to competition from large national and multinational firms that have similar services to our commercial real estate business, and it is possible that further consolidation in the residential and commercial real estate industry could lead to much larger competitors in the geographies, property types and businesses that we serve. In addition, disruptive innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to effectively compete. Further, we also face competition from service providers, who may have greater knowledge of their home markets, a better understanding of the specificities of regulations and local legislation and established reputations in their region. There is no assurance that we will be able to effectively compete, maintain current fee levels or margins, or maintain or increase our market share.",,,,N/A
130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.1.4,"Low demand for housing generally or lease terminations and/or tenant defaults could adversely affect our fees and the income produced by the properties we manage, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.","Low demand for housing generally, or at a particular location due to economic, social or other conditions, may lead to a lower demand for our services. Moreover, our customers’ tenants could experience a change in their financial situation at any time, including as a result of global economic events, natural disasters and public health or pandemic crises. Our customers’ tenants may delay lease commencements, decline to extend or renew their leases upon expiration, fail to make rental payments ----- when due, or declare bankruptcy. Any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenants’ leases, or expiration of existing leases without renewal, and the loss of rental income attributable to the terminated or expired leases. Although a significant portion of our revenues are derived from “stock” businesses consisting of providing fee-based services to our customer portfolio, the loss of income by our customers could hinder their ability to pay such fees. Moreover, while our fees for our Joint Property Management business are expected to be paid by the landlords whether or not the property is being rented or occupied by the landlord, for our Lease Management and Letting business, our fees are paid only if the properties are being rented and paid for by the tenants. Therefore, lease terminations may result in a decrease in fees that we receive. Additionally, even if the lease continues, but the tenant fails to pay rent, we will not be able to collect our fees because they are automatically deducted from rental payments. We also are prohibited by law in France from evicting tenants in the winter so the effect of non-payment may be greater during that time because we will not be able to evict and re-let the property as quickly as during other times in the year. See “Regulation.” In the event of a tenant default or bankruptcy, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights and may incur substantial costs in protecting our customers and re-letting their property. If commercial leases are terminated or defaulted upon, it may be difficult to find a tenant to whom the property can be re-let. We also offer a rent payment guarantee (“Garantie de loyers impayés”) to certain residential landlords who have entrusted us with the management of their property. Under this guarantee, we bear the cost of any unpaid rent and advance such rent to landlords. These advances are not always recoverable from the lessee and thus represent a risk of non-recovery. We also offer an occupancy guarantee (“Garantie d’occupation”) to a small number of lessors to protect against vacant properties for up to six months if we are unable to find a tenant on selected apartments in new buildings. As a result, we may bear the cost of any unoccupied properties under this guarantee. For example, the quantity of unpaid rent typically increases during the winter months when we are prohibited from evicting people under French law, and thus it is possible that we may experience an increase in loss of revenues if we are unable to rent such properties. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, our stock increased temporarily as it built up when we were unable to process disputes and evictions as a result of the first lockdown restrictions. In this case, the COVID-19 pandemic did not result in a significant increase in unpaid rent or defaults, however, we cannot ensure that our revenues will not be negatively impacted as a result of future lockdowns or other COVID-19-related disruptions. There is no assurance that we will receive payments that we are owed under our rent payment and occupancy guarantees; therefore, both represent a large source of potential risk. Moreover, the occurrence of any of the situations described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. For information about our guarantee programs, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key _Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Rent payment and occupancy guarantees” and “Business— Our Businesses—French Residential Real Estate Services—Lease Management and Letting.”_",,,,N/A

The growth and the strength of the UK housing market is closely linked to macroeconomic conditions in the UK, which are affected by macroeconomic conditions in Europe and worldwide. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, global GDP is estimated to have decreased by 2.8% in 2021, with UK GDP declining by 4.0% in the same year. Moreover, the outbreak of the war in Ukraine in February 2022, global supply chain disruptions and other geopolitical conflicts have caused an immediate impact on the UK economy, which is predicted by the IMF to grow more slowly than economies of other developed countries in the near future. Recently, a deterioration in economic conditions in the UK coupled with internal political instability resulted in an increased volatility of the UK mortgage markets, which, in turn, negatively ----- affected the UK real estate sector and contributed to declining real estate valuations in certain areas of the country. Any future deterioration in economic conditions in the UK could lead to increased unemployment rates, loss of earnings, increased short and long-term interest rates, consumer and commercial bankruptcy filings, inflation, increased cost of living, shortages of labor and/or materials and supplies and increased energy prices. All of these factors could negatively impact household and business incomes resulting in decreased demand for new housing, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability and prospects.",,,,N/A

We routinely explore acquiring other businesses and assets, and in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we completed 55 acquisitions. We plan to continue to expand our business externally through similar acquisitions depending in part upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions, which may not be available to us, as well as sufficient funds from our cash on hand, cash flow from operations, existing debt facilities and additional indebtedness to fund these acquisitions. The number of acquisitions we pursue largely depends on the quality of the potential target and a key point of focus during our due diligence on a potential target, and the primary reason we decline to pursue a target after entering into a letter of intent, is the quality of the target’s client accounting. The success of our acquisition strategy depends on the ability of our senior management to identify suitable acquisition candidates, to accurately assess the value, strengths, weaknesses, contingent or other liabilities and potential profitability of such acquisition candidates, to obtain any necessary permits or approvals from regulatory bodies and to integrate the operations of such businesses once they are acquired. Our success in making additional acquisitions depends on the availability of, and competition for, suitable acquisition candidates. Further, we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions for many reasons, including any misjudgment of the key elements of an acquisition, quality of client accounting, competition among buyers, the high valuations of businesses in our industry, the need for regulatory and other approvals, lack of internal resources to actively pursue all attractive opportunities and availability of capital. Even after entering into a share purchase agreement, exclusivity agreement or letter of intent, there can be no assurance that such acquisition will close until such transactions are finalized, which may also impact the Adjusted EBITDA presented in this Offering Memorandum. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—We present _information relating to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Pro Forma M&A Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Revenues, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin and other non-IFRS measures in this Offering Memorandum; certain of the data used in calculating this information was unaudited or involved certain estimates and judgments, and accordingly you should not unduly rely on them.”_ When we do identify and complete acquisitions, we may face financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention and resources needed for existing operations, difficulty with integrating acquired businesses, acquiring businesses that are not consistent with our long-term strategies, integration of different corporate cultures, increased expenses, potential dilution of our brand, assumption of unknown liabilities, indemnities, potential disputes with the sellers and the need to evaluate the financial systems of and establish internal controls for acquired entities. We have historically financed acquisitions through a variety of sources, including our own cash reserves and debt financing. While we intend to continue to finance acquisitions from these sources in the future, we may have insufficient cash reserves to fund acquisitions, and adverse market conditions or other factors may prevent us from obtaining debt finance on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to ----- implement our acquisition strategy, obtain sufficient financing or integrate acquired businesses successfully, our business and prospects for growth could be negatively affected. See “Management’s _Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Acquisitions and Disposals.”_ Given the various risks to which we are exposed and the uncertainties inherent in our business, we cannot guarantee the successful implementation of our acquisition strategies. Additionally, our strategies may put operational strain on our business and consume management time and focus to the detriment of our existing business operations. If we do not meet our strategic objectives or achieve the results initially expected, we may be unable to recover our investment or this may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may not realize the expected benefit of our past or future acquisitions or we may face unforeseen costs or liabilities. In the past, we have grown through a combination of organic development and bolt-on acquisitions, and we intend to continue this combination in the future. Growth through acquisitions entails certain risks, including the risk of a failure to realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions and incurrence of unexpected risks and obligations. Our ability to realize the benefits we anticipate from our acquisition activities, including any anticipated cost synergies and other anticipated benefits, will depend in large part upon whether we are able to integrate such businesses efficiently and effectively. Integration is an ongoing process, and we may not be able to fully integrate such businesses smoothly or successfully, and the process may take longer than expected. Successful integration of acquired businesses will also depend on our ability to effect any required changes in operations or personnel and may require capital expenditures or the funding of unforeseen liabilities. The integration and operation of any future acquisitions may expose us to certain risks, including the following: liability related to the mishandling of customer cash accounts; difficulty in integrating the acquired businesses in a cost-effective manner, including the full integration of the acquired business account management into our IT system, management information and financial control systems; unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual, labor or other issues arising out of the acquisitions; significant unexpected liabilities or contingencies arising from the acquisitions; potential disruptions to our ongoing business caused by our senior management’s focus on the acquired companies; and post-acquisition performance not meeting our expectations or plans. We are required to have separate customer accounts in our Joint Property Management business, and if a target has poor customer accounting policies, it could lead to difficulties collecting customer balances or complying with applicable law. There can be no assurance that our future acquisitions will be made on appropriate terms or at an acceptable cost or can be successfully integrated with the rest of our businesses. A failure to identify appropriate acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our failure to realize the expected benefits or synergies of past or future acquisitions could result in the lack of implementation and achievement of our growth strategy may prevent us from obtaining the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create, or could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.",,,,N/A

In addition, following the acquisition of FirstPort in August 2022, as of September 30, 2022, we managed approximately 321,000 units in the UK under our Joint Property Management business. It may be difficult for us or our agents (including real estate brokers and subcontractors hired by other third parties we engage) to regularly inspect such properties and manage the maintenance and upkeep on behalf of our customers and to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Additionally, we may find it difficult to manage tenants if they encounter difficulties with the properties they rent. For example, although there are certain basic necessities that must function properly, such as heat or water, we cannot force a landlord to comply with all tenant requests if they are not mandated by law. Therefore, a tenant may have an unfavorable view of us as property manager for unresolved requests that the landlord will not approve or if they are unhappy with the quality of work commissioned by the landlord, which can present a risk to our reputation. The occurrence of any such development could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. Our ability to perform the property management services will be affected by various factors, including, among other things, engaging the appropriate subcontractors, maintaining sufficient personnel and retaining key personnel at the number of our properties that we manage under our Lease Management and Letting and Joint Property Management businesses. No assurance can be made that we will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining skilled personnel, in integrating any new personnel into our organization or in engaging with the appropriate subcontractors at reasonable costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to successfully monitor our operations, costs, regulatory compliance and service quality and maintain other necessary internal controls.

Any cost savings, gains and synergies that we realize from these bolt-on acquisitions may differ materially from our estimates. The estimates contained herein are our current estimates, but they involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such estimates. ----- Our ability to realize the expected cost savings, gains and synergies associated with the adjustments included when calculating Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and other non–IFRS financial measures depends on factors beyond our control, such as operating difficulties, increased operating costs, competitors and customers, delays in implementing initiatives and general economic or industry conditions. We may be required to make cash expenditures to achieve such cost savings, gains and synergies, and these costs are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA or Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. We cannot assure you that these cash expenditures to achieve such cost savings, gains and synergies will not be higher than we anticipated. In addition, we may not fully realize such cost savings, gains and synergies within 12 months of the completion of the respective acquisitions, and may not do so at all. Further, our churn rate in respect of the bolt-on acquisitions may be higher than expected. Accordingly, you should not view our presentation of this adjustment in our Adjusted EBITDA or Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as a projection that we will achieve these cost savings or gains. Our ability to realize these anticipated gains and synergies is subject to significant uncertainties and you should not place undue reliance on the adjustments in evaluating our anticipated results. In addition, any cost savings, gains and synergies that we realize may be offset, in whole or in part, by reductions in revenues, or through increases in other expenses, including as a result of the actions we take. For example, reducing sales, marketing and customer support could result in lower revenue and could lead to disruption of our operations, loss of or inability to recruit key personnel, decline in employee productivity, weakening of internal standards, controls or procedures, and impairment of key customer and supplier relationships. Further, no third party, including our independent auditors or any of the initial purchasers, has performed any assurance procedures or expressed an opinion with respect to these estimated cost savings or gains, or their respective achievability.

For example, we entered the UK market in August, 2022, and we have continued to expand in Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and other countries in recent years. Expanding into these geographies involves significant expenditures, over a period of several years, hiring and training of personnel, and marketing efforts to introduce our brand to the new geography. We may not accurately predict such costs or accurately anticipate operational difficulties caused by local conditions, and therefore may not achieve our financial and strategic objectives for our operations in the new geographies. Additionally, any such operational difficulties may impact our customer service, which may lead to customers switching to competitors, or lead to logistical difficulties such as with the processing of invoices and billing. Accordingly, we may incur losses as we expand our operations. Some examples of the risks encountered in entering new regions include: - increased investment associated with understanding new geographies and following trends in these areas in order to effectively compete; - increased costs associated with adapting our products and services to different requirements in the local markets areas, which may decrease our margins and profitability; - challenges relating to developing and maintaining appropriate understanding and complying with new regulatory schemes; - reduced ability to predict our performance because we will have less experience in the new geographies than in our existing geographies; and - political, regulatory and other local risks.

Our ability to attract and retain customers is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, management, workplace culture, financial condition, our response to unexpected events and other subjective qualities. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters, even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct, could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential customers, which could make it difficult for us to attract new customers and maintain existing ones. Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including the personal conduct of individuals associated with our brand, the handling of customer complaints, regulatory compliance, such as compliance with anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and corruption laws, the use and protection of customer and other sensitive information, and actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct. Social media channels can also cause rapid, widespread reputational harm to our brand. Our portfolio of brands and our reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside of our control. For example, any shortcoming of or controversy related to third-party providers, landlords or property owners may be attributed to us, thus damaging our reputation and the value of the affected brand and increasing the attractiveness of our competitors’ services. Also, business decisions or other actions or omissions of our shareholders or management may adversely affect the value of our investments, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, and otherwise damage our reputation ----- and brands. Adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us. The protection of our brand, including related trademarks, may require the expenditure of significant financial and operational resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our portfolio of brands may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our trademarks. Even when we detect infringement or misappropriation of our trademarks, we may not be able to enforce all such trademarks. Any unauthorized use by third parties of any of our brands may adversely affect our brands.

If we are unable to effectively execute and maintain our information technology strategies or adopt new technologies and processes relevant to our service platform, our ability to deliver high-quality services may be materially impaired. In addition, we make significant investments in new systems and tools to achieve competitive advantages and efficiencies. For example, we are in the process of rolling out Millenium, our new ERP system designed to digitize many of our services and lead to operational improvements. Implementation of such investments in information technology could exceed estimated budgets, and we may experience challenges that prevent new strategies or technologies from being realized according to anticipated schedules. If we are unable to maintain current information technology and processes, or encounter delays, or fail to exploit new technologies, the execution of our business plans may be disrupted. Similarly, our employees require effective tools and techniques to perform functions integral to our business. Our payroll and compensation technology systems are important to ensuring that key personnel are compensated accurately and on a timely basis. Failure to pay professionals the compensation they are due in a timely manner could result in higher attrition. Failure to successfully provide such tools and systems, or ensure that employees have properly adopted them, could materially and adversely impact our ability to achieve positive business outcomes.",,,,N/A

As part of this framework, we have adopted several initiatives, including the implementation of our operational models such as “Agency of the Future” and Millenium, our new ERP system which we continuously develop, workflow processes and systems to improve client engagement and outcomes across our service lines. Although we have already successfully begun the rollout of Millenium in our French brokerage and more recently our RRES operations, there is no guarantee that our rollout will continue to be successful from an operational perspective, particular as we aim to accelerate adoption in our operations in the near future. Additionally, our ability to continue to achieve the anticipated cost savings, gains and other benefits from these initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with implementing changes to our tools, processes and systems given our varied service lines, the geographic regions in which we and our customers operate and the number of acquisitions that we have completed in recent years. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we are unsuccessful at implementing changes, if we experience delays, or if other unforeseen events occur, we may not achieve or continue to achieve new operational efficiencies and as a result our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. -----",,,,N/A

If we are unable to find and maintain reliable service providers, any failure by these third parties to adequately perform certain services for us or the loss of these relationships could materially impair our business operations, and reduce our cash flow, income and profitability. For example, the halting of notary activities in connection with the first lockdown directly affected our brokerage activities. While our contracts with certain third parties may provide for indemnification to cover damages resulting from failure to perform their obligations satisfactorily, such indemnification may not fully cover our financial losses in attempting to mitigate their failures or our losses to other parties or may not be received in a timely manner or at all.",,,,N/A

We depend on our business relationships and our reputation to attract and retain customers. As a result, allegations against us, irrespective of the ultimate outcome of such allegations, may harm our professional reputation and as such materially damage our business and its prospects, in addition to any financial impact. As a licensed real estate broker and provider of commercial and residential real estate services, we, and our licensed professionals and independent contractors, are subject to statutory due diligence, disclosure and standard-of-care obligations. Failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us, our sales professionals or independent contractors to litigation from parties who purchased, sold or leased properties that we brokered or managed in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We are subject from time to time to claims by participants in real estate sales and leasing transactions, including associations representing tenants and tenant lobby groups, as well as building owners and companies for whom we provide management services, who claim that we did not fulfill our obligations, or by customers for whom we provided appraisal and valuation services and/or third parties who perceive themselves as having been negatively affected by our appraisals and/or valuations. Additionally, we may be subject to billing-related claims in respect of our RRES business, for example that we have over-billed clients or that we have not been sufficiently transparent in our billing. These consumer organizations representing tenants are able to organize class actions in the real estate services market, which has been introduced by the French Hamon law, and file lawsuits on behalf of tenants. We could be subject to claims following the acquisition of a business or subject to audits and/or fines from various local real estate authorities or regulatory agencies if they determine that we are violating licensing laws or failing to follow certain laws, rules and regulations. In our residential property management business, we hire and supervise third-party contractors to provide services for our managed properties. We may be subject to claims for defects, negligent performance of work or other similar actions or omissions by third parties we do not control. Moreover, our customers may seek to hold us accountable for the actions of contractors because of our role as property or facilities manager or project manager, even if we have technically disclaimed liability as a contractual matter, in which case we may be pressured to participate in a financial settlement for purposes of preserving the customer relationship. We engage with subcontractors to provide a large number of building staff in facilities that we manage, and as a result, we face the risk of potential claims from such staff, such subcontractors. We also face employment-related claims as an employer with respect to our corporate and other employees, for which we would bear ultimate responsibility in the event of an adverse outcome in such ----- matters. We also face claims related to our franchisees, with respect to the termination of our franchise agreements and other claims which may arise related to such agreements. Adverse outcomes of property and facilities management disputes and related or other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, particularly to the extent we may be liable on our contracts, or if our liabilities exceed the amounts of the insurance coverage procured and maintained by us. In addition, we face the risk of claims relating to environmental, health and safety matters relating to properties that we manage. For example, such claims could be based on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing product components and could present potential direct or indirect liabilities to the Group. Further, we face the risk of claims of illness or injury relating to premise liability given that we lease, manage and sell properties to our customers. Some of these litigation risks may be mitigated by the commercial insurance policies we maintain. However, in the event of a substantial loss or certain types of claims, our insurance coverage and/or self-insurance reserve levels might not be sufficient to pay the full damages. Additionally, in the event of grossly negligent or intentionally wrongful conduct, insurance policies that we may have may not cover us at all. Further, the value of otherwise valid claims held under insurance policies could become uncollectible in the event of the covering insurance company’s insolvency, although we seek to limit this risk by placing our commercial insurance only with highly rated companies. Any of these events could materially negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Finally, we are also subject, from time to time, to tax audits and challenges from relevant tax authorities. In this respect, two entities of the Group are currently undergoing tax audits run by the French tax authorities in respect of fiscal years 2016 to 2018 and 2016 to 2019, respectively. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor, they could result in a decrease of our tax losses as well as additional tax liabilities and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Based on our oral exchanges with the French tax authorities, we do not anticipate significant adjustments in the context of the aforementioned tax audits.",,,,N/A

Our ability to conduct our global business may be materially adversely affected by disruptions to these systems or infrastructure. Our information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or disruption from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, system malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber attacks, natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and floods, acts of war or terrorism, employee errors or malfeasance, or other events which are beyond our control. With respect to cyberattacks and viruses, these pose growing threats to many companies, and we may be a target of such threats, which could expose us to ----- liability, reputational harm and significant remediation costs and cause material harm to our business and financial results. For example, our Swiss operations were temporarily disrupted by a ransomware attack in December 2021, though we were able to fully resume normal operations shortly afterwards. Such threats may also disrupt our operations, for example interrupting our customer service offerings or impeding our ability to invoice our customers. In addition, the operation and maintenance of our systems and networks is, in some cases, dependent on third-party technologies, systems and services providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays and loss, corruption or exposure of critical data or intellectual property or disruption of our ability to provide services to or interact with our customers, contractors and vendors, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel. We could also face difficulties in bringing the IT systems of the companies that we acquire up to the standard of our standard security procedures and protections, which could lead to interruptions or failures of our information systems. Furthermore, any such event could result in substantial recovery and remediation costs and liability to customers, business partners and other third parties. Additionally, we may experience higher than expected capital expenditures related to upgrading our IT systems to deal with unexpected future security risks. We have business continuity and disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, but our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient and cannot account for all eventualities, and a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers, our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations, and as a result, our future operating results could be materially adversely affected. Our business relies heavily on the use of software and residential real estate data, some of which is purchased or licensed from third-party providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability. A disruption of our ability to access such software, including an inability to renew such licenses on the same or similar terms, or provide data to our professionals and/or our customers, contractors and vendors or an inadvertent exposure of proprietary data could damage our reputation and competitive position, and our operating results could be adversely affected.",,,,N/A

The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Security breaches and other disruptions of our information and technology networks could compromise our information and intellectual property and expose us to liability, reputational harm and significant remediation costs, which could cause material harm to our business and financial results. Unauthorized disclosure, modification or loss of confidential, personally identifiable or sensitive data or other operational failures may occur through a variety of methods. These include, but are not limited to, systems failures, in-house employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or unauthorized access to or through our information systems, whether by our in-house employees, vendors or third parties, or a cyber-attack by hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations. Information security risks have generally increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the internet, and the increased sophistication and activity of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, cybercriminals and other external parties, some of which may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Cybersecurity attacks are becoming more sophisticated and include malicious software, phishing and spear phishing attacks, wire fraud and payment diversion, account and email takeover attacks, ransomware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches. Cybersecurity attacks, including attacks that are not ultimately successful, could lead to disruptions in our critical systems, unauthorized release of ----- confidential or otherwise protected information or corruption of our data, and could also substantially damage our reputation. We have experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past, including ransomware attacks by cybercriminals, and we expect we may experience additional attacks in the future. Cybersecurity attacks like the ones we have experienced in the past could have a substantial impact on our reputation with our customers, and stakeholders, and may have a material adverse effect on our business. An incident involving disclosure, data modification, loss or security breach or a significant technical failure could subject us to significant monetary damages or losses, litigation, negative publicity, regulatory enforcement actions, and liability under our contracts, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Any person who circumvents our security measures could steal proprietary or confidential customer information or cause interruptions in our operations that could cause us to be unable to provide our services or operate our business, which could damage our reputation. We incur significant costs to protect against security breaches and other cybersecurity attacks and may incur significant additional costs to address issues caused by any such breaches or cybersecurity attacks.

In addition, in connection with the processing of personal data, we are also subject to French law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 on information technology, data files and civil liberties as amended, which incorporates the provisions of the GDPR. A public authority, the French Data Protection Authority (Commission Nationale de l’informatique et des Libertés) (“CNIL”), is responsible for ensuring compliance with data protection regulations in France. We cannot ensure that the confidentiality of such data and information will not be breached as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise, or that doubts may not arise regarding the security of the data and information collected and managed by us. As a result of any continuing legislative initiatives and customer demands, we may have to modify our operations with the goal of further improving data security. The cost of compliance with these laws, regulations and standards is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any such modifications may result in increased expenses and operating complexity, and we may be unable to increase the rates we charge for our services sufficiently to offset these increases. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws, regulations and standards can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties.

For example, certain of our business units rely on proprietary software that we have developed internally or acquired, such as Millenium, or mobile apps developed as part of our digital initiatives strategy. Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing services and solutions similar to ours. Further, the steps we take may not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former in-house employees or other third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

The latest major change came in 2014, with the introduction of the ALUR law, under which the French government introduced, among others, measures to protect individuals considering buying or renting an apartment within a professionally managed co-ownership building. A large amount of extra documentation is now required before the pre-contract (compromis de vente) can be signed, which increases the time between the initial offer and closing. We must comply with law No. 89-462 dated July 6, 1989, which grants residential tenants a statutory right of renewal and caps rents for vacant units and renewed leases at the amount of the last indexed rent paid by the previous tenant and/or of a reference rent determined by the decree. This law also restricts a limited number of landlords a right to recover service charges from tenants and requires residential leases to complete various reports on the environmental status of the property or technical features of the premises. In addition, we are prohibited by law in France from evicting tenants in winter, from November 1 to March 31 each year. We must also comply with articles L.145-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, recently modified by law No. 2014-626 dated June 18, 2014 known as the Pinel Law, for premises leased to commercial tenants. The French commercial leases regime establishes various compulsory obligations establishing, amongst others, a minimum term of nine years, a tenant’s statutory right of renewal on lease expiry, a cap on renewed rents and a limitation on service charge recoverable from tenants. We are also subject to laws of broader applicability, such as tax, securities, environmental, employment laws, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and corruption laws, and occupational health and safety regulations. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of significant fines by governmental authorities, awards of damages to private litigants and significant amounts paid in legal fees or settlements of these matters. As the size and scope of our business has increased significantly during the past decade, both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous licensing and other regulatory requirements and the possible loss resulting from non-compliance have increased. The global economic crisis has resulted in increased government and legislative activities, including the introduction of new legislation and changes to rules and regulations, which we expect will continue into the future. New or revised legislation or regulations applicable to our business may have an adverse effect on our business, including increasing the costs of regulatory compliance or preventing us from providing certain types of services in certain jurisdictions or in connection with certain transactions or customers. For example, on May 25, 2018, GDPR became effective with a greater territorial reach than existing laws, and it applies to all of our contracts and agreements throughout Europe. As a result, we updated and continue to update certain agreements and data protection practices, which may take significant time and cost. We are unable to predict how new laws, rules, regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to laws or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future. Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",,,,N/A

Changes in tax laws or regulations or to their interpretations could adversely affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments. ----- Our tax returns and the tax treatment of our transactions are prepared in accordance with applicable tax legislation and prevailing case law. Certain tax positions we take are based on industry practice, tax advice we have received in some cases from third parties, and similarities to facts and circumstances described in case law. These positions may relate to tax compliance (especially in the current international tax context tending towards enhanced mandatory disclosure obligations), classification of income, treaty relief, withholding tax, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues, including tax base. It is possible that the tax authorities will not agree with the views we have taken. From time to time, we are subject to tax audits, and any challenges from relevant tax authorities with respect to our application and interpretation of tax rules may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, and such adjustments may not be favorable to us. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor, they could result in significant additional tax liabilities and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In particular, European and French tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and are subject to varying interpretations. In this respect, an increase in administrative efforts within our business and an impact on existing structures may occur from the current incorporation into French tax law of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (the “OECD”) principles related to base erosions and profit-shifting (“BEPS”) that were included in the final reports released by the OECD and the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS signed in Paris on June 7, 2017. The European Union intends to harmonize tax legislation of the Member States. In this respect, the Council of the European Union (the “Council of the European Union”) adopted a directive “laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market” on July 12, 2016 (Council Directive 2016/1164) (the “ATAD”). The ATAD was later amended on May 29, 2017 by the Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 (the “ATAD 2”), which, inter alia, extends the scope of the ATAD to hybrid mismatches involving third countries and provides that its provisions apply (subject to certain exceptions) from January 1, 2020. Among the set of measures, the ATAD provides for a general interest limitation rule pursuant to which the tax deduction of net financial expenses is limited to 30% of the taxpayer’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) or to a maximum amount of €3 million, whichever is higher (subject to several exceptions). Such rules apply from January 1, 2019 following their transposition into French tax law. The French Finance Law for 2020 (Law 2019-1479 of December 28, 2019) also introduced under French tax law the provisions of the ATAD 2 in the French Code général des impôts (the “French Tax Code”). See “Risk Factors— _Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes—French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a portion of the interest on our indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to service our indebtedness” for more details on these rules._ Furthermore, Article 108 of the 2019 French Finance Law introduced, under French tax law, the antiabuse provision provided for by the ATAD with respect to French corporate income tax and aims to address abusive tax practices that are not dealt with by specifically targeted provisions (codified under article 205 A of the French Tax Code). Pursuant to this provision, the French tax authorities may ignore an arrangement or a series of arrangements which are not genuinely taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances, having been put into place for the main purpose, or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the applicable tax law. The European Commission has also published a corporate reform package proposal on October 25, 2016 including three new proposals that aim at (i) re-launching the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (“CCCTB”) which is a single set of rules to compute companies’ taxable profits in the EU, (ii) avoiding loopholes associated with profit-shifting for tax between EU countries and non-EU countries, and (iii) providing new dispute resolution rules to relieve problems with double taxation for businesses. In a communication to the European Parliament and the Council of May 18, 2021 and denominated “Business Taxation for the 21st Century”, the European Commission announced additional measures in the field of corporate taxation to take into account the evolution of the context of the EU business taxation policy. In particular, the European Commission announced that it will ----- propose a new framework for income taxation for businesses in Europe (“Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation” or “BEFIT”) that will replace the pending proposals under the CCCTB. BEFIT will be a single corporate tax rulebook for the EU and will consist in consolidating the profits of the EU members of a multinational group into a single tax base, which will then be allocated to member states using a formula and be taxed at national corporate income tax rates. The preparation for this new proposal will be carried out by the European Commission alongside the member states and the European Parliament. The European Commission has launched a public consultation on BEFIT on 17 October 2022 opened to all stakeholders until early 2023. The European Commission also published (i) a proposal for a directive setting out union rules to neutralize the misuse of shell entities for tax purposes on December 22, 2021 (“ATAD 3”) and (ii) a proposal for a directive creating a Debt Equity Bias Reduction Allowance (“DEBRA”) aiming at encouraging companies to finance their investment through equity contributions rather than through debt financing. The discussions on these two proposals are still ongoing at the European Union level and therefore the timing for implementation of their provisions at the level of EU member states initially proposed by the European Commission may be postponed. On October 8, 2021, members of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS (the Inclusive Framework) agreed to the Statement on the Two-Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy reflecting the agreement reached by 136 out of the 140 Inclusive Framework members. The Two-Pillar Solution is comprised of Pillar One and Pillar Two. Pillar One aims at ensuring a distribution of profits and taxing rights among countries with respect to the largest multinational enterprises (“MNEs”) through the re-allocation of taxing rights over 25% of the residual profit of the largest and most profitable MNEs to the jurisdictions where the customers and users of those MNEs are located. Pillar One is however only intended to apply to MNEs with global revenues exceeding €20 billion and a profitability (defined as profit before tax divided by revenue) greater than 10%, subject to certain adjustments and exclusions applicable to MNEs from specific sectors (mostly extractive sectors and regulated financial services), which should only include about a hundred MNEs under the latest assessment of the OECD. Pillar Two puts a floor on tax competition on corporate income tax through the introduction of a global minimum corporate tax at a rate of 15% that countries can use to protect their tax bases (the GloBE rules). On December 20, 2021, the OECD published the pillar two model rules (the “Model Rules”) for the domestic implementation of the 15% global minimum tax rate agreed upon in October 2021. The new Model Rules aim to assist countries to bring the GloBE rules into domestic legislation. They provide for a coordinated system of interlocking rules that (i) define the MNEs within the scope of the minimum tax; (ii) set out a mechanism for calculating an MNE’s effective tax rate on a jurisdictional basis, and for determining the amount of top-up tax payable under the rules; and (iii) determine the member of the MNE group which will be required to pay the top-up tax. On December 22, 2021, the European Commission published a legislative proposal for a Directive setting forth rules to ensure a global minimum level of taxation for multinational groups. The draft Directive aims at consistently implementing among all 27 member states the Model Rules that include an Income Inclusion rule (“IIR”) and an Under Taxed Payment Rule (“UTPR”). However, it also extends its scope to large-scale purely domestic groups, in order to ensure compliance with the European Union fundamental freedoms. In practice, if the Company is regarded as part of an MNE group which has consolidated revenues of more than EUR 750,000,000 in at least two out of the previous four years, it may be within the scope of the GloBE Rules. In addition, the draft Directive makes use of an option contemplated by the Inclusive Framework whereby the member state of a lowtaxed income entity (referred as constituent entity) applying the IIR is required to ensure effective taxation at the minimum agreed level not only for foreign subsidiaries but also for all constituent entities residents in that member State. The Directive was adopted by the EU member states on 15 December 2022 and they will have until 31 December 2023 to transpose the Directive into national legislation, noting that the IIR should be applicable in EU member states for fiscal years starting on or after 31 ----- December 2023 and the UTPR should apply to fiscal years starting on or after 31 December 2024. Furthermore, additional rules on tax dispute resolution apply since January 1, 2019 following the transposition of Council Directive 2017/1852 of October 10, 2017 into French tax law as part of the 2019 French Finance Law. The Group is monitoring these different regulations as they develop and are implemented into applicable law, as they could impact our tax position in the future. Finally, since tax laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which the Group’s companies are located, or operate, or may be located, or may operate, may not always provide clear-cut or definitive guidelines, the tax regime applied to the Group’s operations, intra-group transactions or reorganizations (past or future) is or may sometimes be based on the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s interpretations of French or foreign tax laws and regulations. We cannot guarantee that such interpretations will not be questioned by the relevant tax authorities. More generally, any failure to comply with the tax laws or regulations of the countries in which the Group’s companies are located or operate may result in reassessments, late payment interests, fines and penalties.",,,,N/A

The departure of any of our key employees, including our senior executive leadership, or the loss of a significant number of key revenue producers, if we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements, could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to suffer. Competition for these personnel is significant, and our industry is subject to a relatively high turnover of brokers and front office Joint Property Management managers, and we may not be able to successfully recruit, integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. Through the efficiencies created through our new Millenium platform, we hope to streamline and simplify administrative tasks that may help to retain front office and other staff, but there can be no assurance that this initiative will be successful. In addition, the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified support personnel in all areas of our business and IT personnel in particular. We and our competitors use various financial incentives and sign-on and retention bonuses to help attract, retain and incentivize senior management. As competition is significant for the services of such personnel, the expense of such incentives and bonuses may increase, and we may be unable to attract or retain such personnel to the same extent that we have in the past. If we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel, our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer.",,,,N/A

Labor laws applicable to our business in certain countries, particularly France, are relatively rigorous. In numerous cases, labor laws provide for the strong protection of employees’ interests. Relatedly, we may face disputes from contractors seeking to be recognized as employees under applicable labor laws. In addition, some of our employees are members of unions or, based on applicable regulations, represented by work councils or other bodies. In many cases, we must inform, consult with and request the consent or opinion of union representatives or work councils in managing, developing or restructuring certain aspects of our business. These labor laws and consultative procedures could limit our flexibility with respect to employment policy or economic reorganization and could limit our ability to respond to market changes efficiently. Even where consultative procedures are not mandatory, important strategic business decisions could be negatively received by some employees and employees’ representative bodies, which could lead to labor actions that could disrupt our business. Although we believe our relations with employees are good, our operations may nevertheless be materially affected by strikes, work stoppages, work-slowdowns or other labor-related developments in the future, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our employees in certain countries benefit from collective bargaining agreements, ----- and we may not be able to periodically renegotiate collective agreements on acceptable terms. In particular, higher rates of inflation may cause employees to demand increased salaries, which could either result in higher personnel costs or actual or threatened strikes, work stoppages, or related actions. Settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, in Switzerland, we participate in employer pension plans which provide defined benefits to certain employees covered by labor contracts. These plans are not administered by us and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants. We could be subject to claims arising under these plans, which could materially adversely affect our reputation, business and financial condition.",,,,N/A

Any changes in these accounting standards may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results from operations. In particular, there are a number of standards, amendments and interpretations which have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (the “IASB”) and IFRS standards are subject to change. Certain IFRS standards have been recently revised by the IASB. Notably, in May 2021, the IASB endorsed the conclusions of the IFRS Interpretations Committee (the “IFRS IC”) dated December 2020 regarding the basis for calculating the period of service to which an entity attributes benefit for a particular defined benefit plan. According to these conclusions, entities should consider periods of benefit entitlement and caps on those periods when recognizing benefit obligations. Whereas the approach most commonly used in France was to recognize benefit obligations on a straight-line basis from the date the employee in question joined the entity to the date of their retirement, the IFRS IC considers that benefit obligations should only be recognized on a straight-line basis over the number of years of employee service immediately before the retirement age, and that said years of service should be capped. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition _and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations— Certain changes in accounting standards and accounting policies—2020 Restatement.”_ In addition, in April 2021, the IASB endorsed the conclusions of the IFRS IC dated March 2021 regarding the accounting for configuration or customization costs of a supplier’s application software in a SaaS arrangement. The decision of the IFRS IC confirmed that in most cases, in accordance with IAS 38, such costs shall be recognized as an expense rather than intangible assets since, on the one hand, the customer does not control the software and, on the other hand, the configuration or customization does not generate a resource controlled by the customer that is distinct from the software. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of _Operations—Key ----- _Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations—Certain changes in accounting standards and accounting policies—2021 Restatement.”_ Further, our assumptions, estimates and judgments related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results. IFRS and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, impairment of long-lived assets, leases and related economic transactions, intangibles, self-insurance, income taxes, property and equipment, litigation and equity-based compensation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by us.

Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, a lack of requisite personnel, malicious efforts of internal staff and third parties, theft or fraud. In particular, scams and frauds of various kinds have become more sophisticated in recent years, for example with certain fraudulent schemes posing as our employees or as our customers. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements, inadequate practices, theft or fraud.

See “Description of the _Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject could limit our_ ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. ----- In addition, the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement requires us to comply with certain affirmative covenants while amounts under the Senior Credit Facilities remain outstanding. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the Revolving Credit Facility under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement requires us to comply with a financial ratio, while amounts exceeding a certain threshold remain outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior _Credit Facilities Agreement.” Our ability to meet the financial ratio under the Senior Credit Facilities_ Agreement may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet such financial ratio. A breach of any of the covenants or restrictions under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, including our failure to comply with the financial ratio thereunder, could result in an event of default under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a payment event of default that is continuing under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, subject to the applicable cure period, and upon the acceleration of indebtedness with respect to any other event of default by the creditors under our Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the Senior Credit Facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, a default under the Senior Credit Facilities, including our failure to comply with the financial ratio under the Revolving Credit Facility, could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions, including the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. If our creditors, including the creditors under the Senior Credit Facilities, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries that would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.",,,,N/A

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently anticipated growth, cost savings, gains or efficiencies will be realized, or that future debt financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Additional Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs including the repayment at maturity of the then outstanding amount under the Senior Credit Facilities. At the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility (which matures six months before the Senior Secured Notes), the Additional Notes or any other debt that we have incurred or may incur in the future, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - obtain additional debt or equity capital; - sell assets; or - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Additional Notes, on or before maturity. ----- The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital raising transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay any portion or all of our debt. Any failure to make payments on the Additional Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Credit Facilities, limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial position and results of operations. There can be no assurances that any assets that we could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable.

Some reforms are already effective including the Benchmark Regulations and the cessation of the publication of the sterling LIBOR benchmark and certain tenors of the U.S. dollar LIBOR benchmark after December 31, 2021, while others are still to be implemented. In particular, on March 5, 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the U.S. dollar LIBOR benchmark after June 30, 2023. Separately, the euro risk free rate working group for the euro area has published a set of guiding principles and high level recommendations for fallback provisions in, amongst other things, new euro denominated cash products (including bonds) referencing EURIBOR. The guiding principles indicate, among other things, that continuing to reference EURIBOR in relevant contracts (without robust fallback provisions) may increase the risk to the euro area financial system. These reforms and recommendations may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (the “Benchmarks Regulation”) applies, subject to certain transitional provisions, to the provision of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of a benchmark within the EU (which, for these purposes, includes the United Kingdom). Among other things, it (i) requires benchmark administrators to be authorized or registered (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regime or otherwise recognized or endorsed) and (ii) prevents certain uses by EU supervised entities of benchmarks of administrators that are not authorized or registered (or, if non-EU based, not deemed equivalent or recognized or endorsed). The Benchmarks Regulation could have a material impact on the Senior Credit Facilities if the methodology or other terms of the benchmark are changed in order to comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation. Such changes could, among other things, have the effect of reducing, increasing or otherwise affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the relevant benchmark. More broadly, any of the international or national reforms, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks, could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a benchmark and complying with any such regulations or requirements. ----- It is not possible to predict with certainty whether, and to what extent, the various benchmarks will continue to be supported going forward. This may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, and may have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Such factors may have (without limitation) the following effects on certain benchmarks: (i) discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to a benchmark; (ii) triggering changes in the rules or methodologies used in the benchmark; and/or (iii) leading to the disappearance of the benchmark. Any of the above changes or any other consequential changes as a result of international or national reforms or other initiatives or investigations, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported benchmarks, which could have an adverse impact on the interest we pay on borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities. To the extent that interest rates were to increase significantly, including as a result of changing macro-economic conditions, our interest expense could correspondingly increase, thereby reducing our cash flow and hindering our ability to make payments on the Senior Secured Notes (including the Additional Notes) and the Senior Notes. None of the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Indenture contains a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt. Although we have entered into and maintain, hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, notably two new interest rate hedging arrangements amounting to €573.75 million each set up by the Group by purchasing two new 1% strike CAP against 3-month EURIBOR (December 2024 maturity), there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. If one or more of our counterparties falls into bankruptcy, claims we have under the swap agreements or other hedging arrangements may become worthless. In addition, in the event that we refinance our debt or otherwise terminate such hedging agreements, we may be required to make termination payments, which would result in a loss.",,,,N/A

The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions governing the sharing of proceeds from enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. Such enforcement proceeds are required to be turned over to the Security Agent after certain events, including the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes. The Security Agent is required to apply turned over amounts and other recoveries by the Security Agent from enforcement actions toward discharging the super senior obligations (including, among others (following the designation of the Revolving Credit Facility as a super senior liability in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, after the date on which the Term Loan Facilities are refinanced in full), those under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and future indebtedness that may be secured on a super senior basis (the “Super Senior Liabilities”)) in priority to applying any such amounts toward discharging the Senior Secured Notes.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture also permits the Senior Secured Notes Collateral to secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will only enforce the Senior Secured Notes Collateral as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. Prior to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer designating any liabilities as Super Senior Liabilities in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (the “Designation Date”), the Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that consists of the holders of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes, the senior lenders, creditors in respect of indebtedness ranking pari passu with the senior creditors and creditors in respect of certain non-priority hedging obligations (the “Senior Secured Credit Participations”) which aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations at that time (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”) (in each case, acting through their respective creditor representatives). If the Majority Senior Secured Creditors do not instruct the Security Agent to enforce, or instruct the Security Agent to cease enforcing the transaction security, then, in certain cases, creditors holding more than 50% of the total second lien credit participations (or, in certain cases, creditors holding 50% of the total Topco credit participations) may instruct the Security Agent to enforce. ----- Following the Designation Date, the Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that may consist of either (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or (ii) creditors holding more than 50% of the total participations in Super Senior Liabilities at that time (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”). The Security Agent is required to act in accordance with instructions received from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, however: (i) if and to the extent the obligations under the Super Senior Liabilities have not been fully and finally discharged within six months of enforcement instructions first being issued by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors; or (ii) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of enforcement instructions first being issued by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors, then the enforcement instructions provided by the Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail. Following the transaction security having become enforceable, if (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue and (ii) (x) the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith that to delay issuing enforcement instructions could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any transaction security or the realization of enforcement proceeds, and (y) deliver enforcement instructions which they reasonably believe to be consistent with the enforcement principles and necessary or advisable to enhance the prospects of achieving the enforcement objectives before the security agent has received any enforcement instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, in such circumstances, the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the enforcement instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors. If at any time an insolvency event has occurred with respect to any debtor (other than an insolvency event which is the direct result of any action taken by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors), the Security Agent shall act (i) prior to the Designation Date, in accordance with the instructions of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (without any requirement to first consult with any junior creditors), or (ii) after the Designation Date and to the extent the Majority Super Senior Creditors have provided such instructions, in accordance with the instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors.

In connection with any enforcement instructions received by it, the Security Agent may request security and/or indemnity and/or prefunding satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense (including legal fees). To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes (such as indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities Agreement), the voting interest of holders of Senior Secured Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we incur. The creditors of any Super Senior Liabilities may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Senior Secured Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells Senior Secured Notes Collateral consisting of the shares of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such entities securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees may be released.

The share pledges over financial securities (whether in the form of a pledge over a financial securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) of French companies may be enforced at the option of the secured creditor, either by a sale of the pledged financial securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors), by judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or by contractual foreclosure (attribution conventionnelle or _pacte commissoire) of the financial securities to the secured creditor, following which the secured_ creditor becomes the legal owner of the pledged financial securities. In a proceeding for attribution _judiciaire or attribution conventionnelle, an expert is appointed (whether contractually or by the court)_ to value the collateral (in this case, the pledged financial securities), and if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt under the pledge, the secured creditor is required to pay the relevant pledgor a soulte equal to the difference between the value of the financial securities and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent sale of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. Also, if the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether an attribution judiciaire _or an attribution conventionnelle), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value_ of the foreclosed financial securities. Consequently, in the event the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf as well as on behalf of the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, or as creditor of the parallel debt) decides to, and is entitled to, enforce the financial securities pledges through a judicial or contractual foreclosure and if the value of such financial securities exceeds the amount of the secured debt under the pledge, the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf as well as for the benefit of the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, or as creditor of the parallel debt) may be required to pay to the relevant pledgor a soulte equal to the value by which such financial securities exceeds the amount of secured debt under the pledge. If the value of such financial securities is less than the amount of the secured debt under the pledge, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditor will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such financial securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditor will be unsecured. If the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf as well as on behalf of the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, or as creditor of the parallel debt) declines to request the judicial or contractual foreclosure of the financial securities, a sale of the pledged financial securities could be undertaken by public auction in accordance with applicable law. Due to the French regulatory restrictions set forth in the immediately following risk factor, the Security Agent (acting on its own behalf as well as on behalf of the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, or as creditor of the parallel debt) is likely to have an incentive to enforce the pledged financial securities through a public auction. Since public auction procedures are not designed for a sale of a business as a going concern (as the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis ----- of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies), it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the Group as a going concern.",,,,N/A

In the event of an enforcement of the security interests in respect of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. No appraisal of the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral has been made in connection with this Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers. The shares and other Senior Secured Notes Collateral that are pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Senior Secured Notes, in part because most of such collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be ----- less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, such as France, include restrictions on persons who may hold certain of our licenses, authorizations and consents that are necessary to operate our business. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security Documents, enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets do not secure the Senior Secured Notes and it is possible that the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Senior Secured Notes Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged, because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Senior Secured Notes, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes.

In addition, the multi-jurisdictional nature of enforcement over the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may limit the realizable value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdiction of organization of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and with the laws of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest, the duration of proceeding and preference periods. The application of these laws, and any conflict between them, could call into question whether, and to what extent, the laws of any particular jurisdiction should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Security Documents in these jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.",,,,N/A

The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be restricted by local law.","In France, where parallel debt obligations are, or a separate appointment of the security agent for local law purposes is, customary or required, the security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral that secure the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Additional Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the Additional Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement provide that only the Security Agent (agent des sûretés) under Articles 2488-6 et seq of the French Civil Code has the right to enforce such security documents. As a consequence, holders of the Additional Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the ----- Additional Notes, except through the Trustee, who will provide instructions (subject to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) to the Security Agent. The security over the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be granted in favor of the Security Agent as beneficiary of parallel debt obligations (“Parallel Debt”) created to satisfy a requirement that the Security Agent, as grantee of certain types of collateral, be a creditor of the relevant Guarantor. Pursuant to the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Parallel Debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, including any additional Notes (the “Principal Obligations”). Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. The Security Agent will have, pursuant to the Parallel Debt, a claim against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer for the full principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes. The holders of the Additional Notes will not be entitled to enforce such security, except through the Security Agent. Holders of Additional Notes bear some risks associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as a beneficiary of the Parallel Debt. The Parallel Debt obligations referred to above are contained in the Intercreditor Agreement, which is governed by English law. There can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective before French courts since there is no judicial or other guidance as to its efficacy, and therefore the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be restricted as the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be invalid or unenforceable with respect to the claims of any person who is not a party to the relevant security document, including all holders of the Senior Secured Notes. To the extent that the security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral created under the parallel debt structure are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Additional Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interest in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Additional Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.",,,,N/A

Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as such will reduce the aggregate value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes to the extent of liens securing the shares of such unrestricted subsidiary or of its subsidiaries.

130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.3,Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes,1.3.13,"The insolvency laws of France may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations on the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.","On and after the Issue Date as described elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, our obligations under the Additional Notes will be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantors and secured by security interests over the relevant Senior Secured Notes Collateral. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is organized under the laws of France and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of France. There is a rebuttable presumption that the “centre of main interest,” as defined in the Council Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast), is the jurisdiction where the registered office is situated. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will include a pledge over the shares in certain of our subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of France and pledges of certain present and future intercompany loan receivables and bank accounts held by the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries and third-party Senior Secured Notes Collateral providers (as applicable) incorporated under the laws of France. The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In particular, the French bankruptcy laws and regulations are unfavorable to creditors in many respects. In the event that any one or more of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s, the Guarantors’ or any other of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Additional Notes against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the enforceability of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the Security Interests. In certain circumstances, the court may also void the Security Interest or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee if the company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or the Security Interests provided by such Guarantor; ----- - direct that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes return any amounts paid under a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or any Security Interest to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to you. If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Security Interest is found to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Additional Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or the Security Interests will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors under the Security Documents (as defined herein) will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Security Interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See also “—The Senior Secured Notes and _the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.”_ In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests created, the Guarantor: - issued such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its insolvency; - issued such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent businessman as a shareholder of such Guarantor would have contributed equity to such Guarantor or where the relevant beneficiary of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Security Interest knew or should have known that the Guarantor was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made; or - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Security Interest on the basis that the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Security Interest were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly for the Guarantor’s benefit, or on some other basis and: (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or the creation of the Security Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s assets were unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due. Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or created any Security Interest if: - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute. ----- Although we believe we are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” as of the date the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee was issued or the Security Interests were created, that payments to holders of the Senior Secured Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

130_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.3,Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes,1.3.14,The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.,"Our Guarantors are organized under the laws of France. Enforcement of the obligations under a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee against any such Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance and regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. The obligations of the Guarantors incorporated in France and the enforcement of each such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee is not in the relevant Guarantor’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor, or such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. An increase in the amount of debt that benefits from such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee without a corresponding increase in the amount of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee will dilute the value of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee to its beneficiaries, including the holders of the Additional Notes. Accordingly, enforcement of any such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee against the relevant Guarantor would be subject to certain defenses available to guarantors generally or, in some cases, to limitations contained in the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant Guarantors. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance and regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law applicable to it. Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing, or providing security in relation to, indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition. Under French corporate benefit rules, a court could declare any guarantee or security unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, or any proceeds have been obtained from the enforcement of any security, require that the recipient return the payment or any proceeds so obtained to the relevant guarantor or security provider, if the court found that the Guarantor or security provider did not receive some real and adequate corporate benefit from the transaction involving the grant of the guarantee or security as a whole. Existence of corporate benefit is a factual matter which must be determined on a case-by- case basis. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the Guarantor or security provider and whether the amounts guaranteed or secured ----- are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance. In addition, each of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and Senior Secured Notes Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security provider under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. In particular, enforcement of any such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral against the relevant Guarantor or security provider would be subject to certain contractual limitations (so called “limitation language”) contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (or any other document governing the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees) and Security Documents, respectively, designed to ensure compliance with statutory requirements applicable to the relevant Guarantor or security provider. As a result, a Guarantor’s or security provider’s liability under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law and contractual enforcement restrictions applicable to it. This could lead to a situation in which such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral cannot be enforced at all. It is possible that a Guarantor or security provider, or any of their creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s guarantee or the security provider’s Senior Secured Notes Collateral on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral should be limited or voided. To the extent that any limitations on the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantees or Senior Secured Notes Collateral apply the Additional Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or security provider, including trade payables of such Guarantor or security provider. Future Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be subject to similar limitations. It is possible that a Guarantor, or a creditor of a Guarantor, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Guarantor, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s guarantee on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee should be limited or voided. To the extent that agreed limitations on the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee obligation apply, the Senior Secured Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, including trade payables of such Guarantor. Future guarantees may be subject to similar limitations. Moreover, an increase in the amount of debt that benefits from such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee without a corresponding increase in the amount of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee will dilute the value of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee to its beneficiaries, including the holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

Interests in the Global Notes will trade in book-entry form only, and Additional Notes in definitive registered form, or Definitive Registered Notes, will be issued in exchange for book-entry interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Additional Notes. The common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global notes representing the Additional Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the global notes representing the Additional Notes will be made to the paying agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Global Notes representing the Additional Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and if investors are not participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Additional Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. Unlike the holders of the Additional Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Additional Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent it has received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis. Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, unless and until Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry interests, they will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Additional Notes. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”",,,,N/A

The definition of “change of control” in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture includes (with certain exceptions) a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” it has no clearly established meaning under relevant law, varies according to the facts and circumstances of the subject transaction and is subject to judicial interpretation. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of a person, and therefore it may be unclear whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes.",,,,N/A

In such event, each holding company of the Pushdown_ Entity would be released from its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. In either case, such modifications to the terms of the Senior Secured Notes could be treated for US federal income tax purposes as a deemed exchange of (i) the Senior Secured Notes as in place prior to such modifications for (ii) new Senior Secured Notes as in place after such modifications (the “New Notes”). If such modifications result in a deemed exchange for US federal income tax purposes, it would generally be treated as a taxable transaction for US federal income tax purposes in which beneficial owners of the Senior Secured Notes would be required to recognize any gain or loss. Furthermore, for US federal income tax purposes, the New Notes deemed issued in such a deemed exchange could be treated as issued with original issue discount. In such event, US Holders (as defined under “Certain Tax _Considerations—Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences”) would be required to_ include the original issue discount in their income as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash corresponding to such income. In addition, the determination of whether the New Notes are treated as “contingent payment debt instruments” as a result of the possibility of additional payments, as further described under “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain United States Federal Income Tax _Consequences—Additional Payments,” would be made at the time of the modification.

In this respect, French case law has developed the concept of “abnormal act of management,” according to which the expenses incurred by a French company, in relation with transactions that are not aligned with its direct corporate interest, are not tax deductible. ----- Under Article 39-1-3 of the French Tax Code, interest paid by an entity to its direct shareholders who are not related parties within the meaning of Article 39-12 of the French Tax Code are tax deductible only up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate referred to in Article 39-1-3 of the French Tax Code (i.e., the annual average of the average effective floating rates on bank loans to companies with an initial maturity exceeding two years). Under Article 212 I-(a) of the French Tax Code, interest incurred on loans granted by related parties within the meaning of Article 39-12 of the French Tax Code is deductible up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate referred to in Article 39-1-3 of the French Tax Code or, if higher, up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate that the borrowing entity could have obtained from independent financial credit institutions in similar circumstances. Pursuant to Article 39-12 of the French Tax Code, two entities will be regarded as related if (i) one of the entities holds directly or indirectly the majority of the other entity’s share capital or actually exercises the power of decision in that entity or (ii) both entities are placed under the conditions defined in (i) under the control of a same third entity. In both cases (i.e., non-deductibility under Article 39-1-3 and 212 I-(a) of the French Tax Code), nondeductible interest would constitute constructive dividends pursuant to Articles 109 et seq. of the French Tax Code, which may be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code, at (i) the standard corporate income tax rate set forth in the first sentence of the second paragraph of Article 219 I of the French Tax Code (i.e., 25%) for payments benefiting legal persons or (ii) the rate of 75% for payments made in non-cooperative jurisdictions within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code other than those mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of the same Article 238-0 A (subject in any case to more favorable provisions of an applicable double tax treaty). Pursuant to Article 212 bis of the French Tax Code, the deductibility of net financial expenses incurred by an entity in respect of a given fiscal year is limited to the higher of (i) €3 million (to be adjusted on a _pro rata temporis basis for fiscal years which do no last 12 months) and (ii) 30% of its adjusted EBITDA in the same fiscal year (corresponding to its taxable income before offset of carry forward tax losses and without taking into consideration net financial expenses and, to some extent, depreciation, provisions and capital gains/losses) generated by such entity (the “30% Limitation”). Such limitation applies to both related-party and third-party financings regardless of the purpose of these financings, subject to certain limited exceptions. Furthermore, for entities being part of a group that files eligible consolidated financial statements, a safeguard clause has been implemented whereby companies that are able to demonstrate that the ratio of their net equity over their total assets is equal to or higher than the same ratio computed at the level of the accounting consolidated group to which they belong can, provided they are not thinly capitalized, deduct net financial expenses exceeding the 30% Limitation up to 75% of their amount. French thin-capitalization rules apply in respect of loans granted by related parties. Where the amount of the related party debt of a company exceeds a ratio equal to 1.5 time the company’s net equity, its net financial expenses are deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 30% of its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €3 million, multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by non-related parties (directly or indirectly) within the meaning of Article 39-12 of the French Tax Code increased by 1.5 time the company’s net equity (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said year. The balance of net financial expenses is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 10% of its adjusted EBITDA or (ii) €1 million multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by related parties (directly or indirectly) within the meaning of Article 39-12 of the French Tax Code exceeding 1.5 time the company’s net equity (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said fiscal year. However, the interest deductibility limitation provided for by these amended thin-capitalization rules does not apply if the borrowing company demonstrates that the overall ----- indebtedness ratio of the consolidated group to which it belongs, as determined under accounting consolidation rules (i.e., the ratio existing between the total amount of the consolidated group’s debts (with the exception of those owed to companies belonging to the consolidated group) and the amount of the consolidated group’s net equity), is higher than or equal to its own indebtedness ratio (i.e., the ratio existing between the total amount of its debts and the amount of its net equity). Financial expenses that are disallowed pursuant to the 30% Limitation can be carried forward indefinitely and deducted in the future under the same conditions. On the other hand, the portion of financial expenses which tax deduction is disallowed as a result of the application of the €1 million threshold or 10% limitation is only eligible for carry-forward for one-third of its amount. The unused interest deduction capacity of a current fiscal year may also be used over the five following fiscal years, but only against financial expenses incurred in respect of those fiscal years, it being noted that this measure is not available to thinly capitalized entities. Specific rules apply to companies that belong to French tax consolidated groups, i.e., mainly (i) the 30% Limitation is computed on the basis of the consolidated adjusted EBITDA generated by the French tax group and (ii) the 1.5 debt-to-equity ratio is analyzed (x) on a consolidated basis at the level of the French tax group perimeter pursuant to French accounting rules applying for purposes of establishing consolidated financial statements and (y) in respect of loans granted by related parties within the meaning of Article 39-12 of the French Tax Code which do not belong to the same tax consolidated group. These thin-capitalization rules could apply at the level of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (in respect of any loans contracted by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer from any related party) and at the level of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s French subsidiaries that do not belong to the same French tax consolidated group as the Senior Secured Notes Issuer with respect to any amount of the proceeds of the Additional Notes used by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to grant intragroup loans to such subsidiaries as well as, more generally, in respect of any loans contracted by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s French subsidiaries from any related party. Pursuant to the _Bulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques-Impôts_ BOI-IS-BASE-35-40-10-20, § 20, dated May 13, 2020 and BOI-IS-BASE-35-40-20, § 240, dated May 13, 2020, the portion of interest that is not deductible by virtue of (i) Article 212 bis, I of the French Tax Code under the 30% Limitation and/or (ii) Article 212 bis, VII of the French Tax Code under the thin-capitalization rules is not to be recharacterized as a “deemed distribution” pursuant to Articles 119 et seq. of the French Tax Code and, therefore, is not subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code. Finally, the provisions of the ATAD 2 in relation to hybrid mismatches with third countries, have been implemented into French law by the French Finance Law for 2020 and have been applicable as from January 1, 2020, except for certain provisions which have been applicable as from January 1, 2022. Articles 205 B et seq. of the French Tax Code implementing ATAD 2 provide limitations on interest deductions in the event of (i) a deduction of a payment at the level of a paying entity without a corresponding inclusion of such payment in the taxable income of the receiving entity (referred to as a “deduction without inclusion”), or (ii) a deduction of the same payment, operational expenses or losses in the taxable income of both the paying and receiving entity (referred to as a “double deduction”). Such limitations only apply to payments taking place between “associated enterprises,” except for the socalled “structured arrangements” (i.e., an arrangement pricing the relevant mismatch or an arrangement designed to produce the mismatch, subject to certain conditions). If the hybrid mismatch results in a deduction without inclusion, the deduction from taxable income will generally be denied to the French paying entity. Alternatively, the payment to a French receiving entity will be included in its taxable income if deduction is not denied in the jurisdiction of the paying entity. If the hybrid mismatch results in a double deduction, the deduction will either be denied at the level of the receiving entity or at the level of the paying entity. ----- In respect of fiscal years opened as from January 1, 2022, these provisions also cover reverse hybrid entities, referring to situations where an entity is deemed to be tax transparent by the Member State in which it is incorporated or established but the jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which its “associated enterprises” holding directly or indirectly in aggregate an interest in 50% or more of its voting rights, capital interests or rights to share profit are established, qualify the entity as non-transparent. Where a hybrid entity of a reverse hybrid mismatch is incorporated or established in France, its income is, as the case may be, either subject to French corporate income tax or taxable pursuant to the conditions provided for by Article 8 of the French Tax Code, to the extent that it is not taxed in another State. The abovementioned tax rules may limit our ability to deduct interest accrued on our indebtedness incurred in France and, as a consequence, may increase our tax burden, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and reduce the cash flow available to service our indebtedness.",,,,N/A

131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.1.1,Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by volatile or uncertain economic conditions.,"Demand for our staffing services is sensitive to changes in the level of economic activity and economic conditions in the countries, regions and sectors in which we operate. A global economic downturn, such as the one resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic, which impacts a country or region in which we operate may adversely affect our staffing services in that country or region, as fewer clients may seek our job candidates for assignments. In addition, the outbreak of the war in Ukraine in February 2022, global supply chain disruptions and other geopolitical conflicts have caused an immediate impact on global economic conditions, which has led to increased inflationary pressure in 2022, including causing increases in the price for goods and services, which has resulted and may continue to result in shortages in materials and services. Such shortages have resulted and may continue to result in inflationary cost increases for labor, fuel, materials and services, and could continue to cause costs to increase. Although we do not have direct economic activities in Russia and Ukraine and currently the conflict has not had any material impact on our overall sales and EBITDA, it is difficult to predict the scope and extent of any potential impact of the increasing tensions and other geopolitical conflicts could have on our operations, especially given we source candidates from Eastern Europe. Moreover, gas and other raw materials in relation to supply shortages are significantly impacting many industries and sectors, which could result in our clients reconsidering their recruitment efforts of domestic and foreign talents, which may, in turn, impact our results of operations. Furthermore, continuing increases in inflation could impact the overall demand for and costs of our services and the margins we are able to realize on our services, all of which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Inflation may also result in higher interest rates, which in turn would result in higher interests we incur on our borrowings. While the global economy has recovered from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021, there remains considerable uncertainty over the long-term effects of the above factors and the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies which had been adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world’s leading economies in the past decade. We cannot predict the long-term effects such factors may have on the global political and economic conditions, including whether they may result in a severe or prolonged global economic recession. Moreover, our revenue and results of operations are dependent on a limited number of countries in Europe and we have material operations in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France. For the year ended December 31, 2021, these countries accounted for 27.8%, 41.9%, 22.2% and 8.1%, respectively, of our _Pro Forma Management Adjusted Revenue and as a result, we are particularly exposed to risks arising from economic conditions in these countries. For example, as the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) represents a key export market for several of the countries in which we operate, ----- particularly Belgium and the Netherlands, adverse trade terms between the U.K. and the countries in which we operate following the entry into force of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement on May 1, 2021 could have an adverse effect on the economies of these countries, which could by extension adversely affect demand for our services or our business. Moreover, there is a possibility that other Member States, including the countries where we source our job candidates, could also withdraw from the EU. If this materializes, it could pose further uncertainties on the application of laws and the economies within the EU and the countries involved, including limitation on the free movement of people, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, a downturn in the endmarkets in which we target clients could have a negative impact on the demand for our services or the prices clients are willing to pay for our services. Moreover, an economic downturn may impact us differently than it has in the past. Among our two business segments, specialized talent solutions has historically been more sensitive to economic fluctuations due to the temporary and flexible staffing element in this segment, which has led to decreases in demand for such services in connection with economic downturns, including that experienced in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic, even if it has historically recovered faster compared to the engineering and consulting segment. Actions that we take to decrease our expenses during an economic downturn may not prevent a loss in operating profit and could have a longer term impact on our operations. When demand drops or remains low, we attempt to reduce the amount of our sales and marketing expenses and job candidates in order to reduce our cost of services and operating expenses but such reductions may not occur as quickly as, or be sufficient to offset the decrease in our revenue. If periods of decline are prolonged and result in a significant decrease in the size of our in-house employees or job candidates, we may not be able to reduce our expenses without negatively impacting the long-term potential of our business units, branches and brands. Furthermore, our decentralized structure can lead to increased costs, which in times of economic downturn could lead to decreased profitability. Any of the foregoing risks, if they were to occur, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",,,,N/A
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.1.2,"The Covid-19 pandemic, including the resulting global economic uncertainty and the related lockdown measures, in particular its effects in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France where we have material operations, or other epidemics or pandemics, have had in the past, and could have in the future, a significant adverse impact on demand for our staffing services, our revenue, operations and workforce.","The Covid-19 pandemic, including the emergence of variants such as Delta and Omicron and related sub-variants, and the rapidly evolving reactions of authorities, including those in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France, to contain the spread and address the impact of Covid-19 have had significant direct and indirect effects on businesses and commerce generally, including disruptions to supply chain, workforce, transactional activity, facility operation and production. While restrictions on the conduct of business in many jurisdictions, including the closure of workplaces determined to be non-essential, have eased or been lifted, there remain certain restrictions on the international, national and local movement of people and goods, which continue to disrupt many of our clients’ business operations and their recruitment needs. The extent and scope of such restrictions continue to be highly uncertain and subject to change, and stricter measures could potentially be put in place in the future. A prolonged continuance of this public health crisis could therefore have a material adverse effect, including materially increased volatility in financial markets and significant worsening of the global, European, Belgian, Dutch, German and French macroeconomic outlooks. The spread of Covid-19 has led us to modify certain of our operational practices, and we may take further actions required by authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our in-house employees, job candidates and other stakeholders. We implemented a work-from-home policy that has been used by most of our in-house employees. For the Group’s in-house employees who cannot work remotely, we have implemented additional protective procedures, including equipping employees with ----- sanitizing equipment (such as disinfectants and hand sanitizers), implementing social distancing, staggering employees working hours as required to comply with governmental restrictions, and increasing the frequency of cleaning in the Group’s facilities, but these measures may not prevent the exposure of our in-house employees to Covid-19. For job candidates on assignment with a client, many of the markets in which we operate still place certain responsibilities on us for overseeing certain health and safety obligations for our job candidates. See “Regulation.” As a result, for certain job candidates who have been placed in client workplaces where exposure to Covid-19 is possible, we may be subject to risk of liability should such employees allege their workplaces failed to adequately mitigate the risk of exposure to Covid-19. Since we also place job candidates and certain employees with our clients, it is also possible that one of our job candidates or employees with Covid-19 could then infect other employees at the clients’ premises, which could lead to sickness, shutdowns or late deliveries at a client’s business. Clients may hold us liable should we not have taken the required precautionary measures with such job candidates or employees and it could also cause reputational harm to us should any such events occur. In addition, in order to facilitate remote working arrangements, some of our job candidates are accessing client workspaces from their personal devices through cloud-based systems, which could increase cybersecurity risks to our clients for which they may hold us liable. The intersection of public health, workplace safety, employer liability and privacy laws is complex, and we cannot predict how regulatory or liability regimes may evolve in the future as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Although we have seen a full recovery of our financial performance in 2021 and the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we cannot predict the impact that any future developments relating to the Covid19 pandemic may have on the demand for our staffing services and on our business, results of operations and financial position. These developments may include, but are not limited to, the duration and spread of Covid-19, its severity, emergence of new variants and further actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, including the rate of deployment of vaccines. A number of measures taken by governments in the early stage of the Covid-19 pandemic intended to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 caused dramatic disruptions to our clients businesses and impacted the demands for our staffing services in 2020, in particular in the non-food retail, hotel, restaurant and cafe, aerospace, travel and tourism and automobile industries. Future waves of Covid-19 may result in national or local governments reviving such severe countermeasures. For example, in the spring of 2020 different degrees of lockdowns were introduced in each of our primary geographic markets which had an immediate impact on demand for our staffing services. Softer lockdowns were introduced again in the autumn of 2020 which also led to a decrease in job candidates at work after we had experienced a gradual increase in the number of job candidates at work following the initial lockdown in the spring of 2020. Governmental countermeasures eased again in early 2021, which led to the gradual normalization of economic activities in our primary geographic markets, recovering to pre-Covid-19 levels. This trend was carried into 2022 despite the outbreak of the new strain of Covid-19, Omicron, in the last weeks of 2021 and at the beginning of 2022. Governments could, however, impose similar or more stringent restrictions again in the future as they deem necessary, and this could lead to economic distress and reduced demand for our staffing services, which could affect our results of operations. Potential future lockdown measures, such as shutting down production facilities and offices or restricting free movement of transportation and distribution, closing of restaurant and bar facilities, closing or reducing hospitality at events, amongst others, could disrupt our client’s businesses or ours more significantly in the future than what has been experienced to date, leading them to curtail their reliance on us. Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, there were a number of government measures introduced, including in our primary markets of Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France, which positively contributed to the Group’s ability to manage cash flows during the period and manage the costs associated with our in-house employees and job candidates. For example, we utilized temporary unemployment measures introduced that have allowed us to retain certain in-house employees and job candidates without bearing the full expense of their wages and salaries and have utilized certain postponement of VAT or other tax and benefit payments. A number of these measures, however, ended during the course of 2021, and the remaining measures expired as of July 2022. While this has, to date, only resulted in a minor impact on our costs, we could experience additional costs and liabilities and ----- may also find it more difficult to retain in-house employees and job candidates if demand for our staffing services reduces or is variable due to a resurgence of Covid-19 in the markets in which we operate, without the introduction of additional government measures (or which there is no guarantee any will be introduced). If any of the foregoing were to occur, there could be a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",,,,N/A

As a result, while we seek to pass on our costs to our clients, this may not be feasible in all situations. These assumptions and estimates may prove to be inaccurate, particularly if operating costs continue to rise in the current inflationary environment, as well as due to other increases in our costs driven by changes in regulation, increased competition in the labor market, changes to economic conditions, other costs beyond our control or other developments, and as a result, our margins under these contracts may be materially adversely affected. In particular, we may be unable to pass on increases in costs due to a change in regulation governing minimum wage requirements, payments required to be made under social security and other benefits which could affect our profitability. For the year ended December 31, 2021, personnel expenses and wage taxes, in aggregate, constituted 85.1% of our cost of services. Although we seek to structure our arrangements with third parties on a back-to-back basis with the related customer arrangements, for example, by entering into agreements with job candidates with durations and termination rights that are coterminous with the duration of our contracts with the relevant clients, there may be instances where we are not able to offset or transfer such costs to our clients. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",,,,N/A
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.1.4,The employment services sector is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully in our markets.,"Our industry is highly competitive. This is driven by a variety of factors, including low barriers to entry especially in localized markets, the availability of qualified job candidates, the quality and speed of customer service, and brand loyalty. We compete in a number of our markets with large, consolidated international staffing services providers and smaller, more localized companies. Many of our competitors are global full-service and specialized employment services providers with substantial marketing and financial resources, and may be better positioned in certain markets. For example, our Accent Powerhouse which operates in the specialized talent solutions segment in Belgium, faces competition from global service providers, each of which compete mainly on volume-driven clients. We expect that we will continue to experience pressure on price from competitors and clients. We may also face increased competition from smaller, more localized staffing solutions providers. Such firms would most likely cater to a smaller set of clients and as a result, may be able to provide more time and attention to their clients. In particular, SME and ISEs may prefer to work with more localized firms. Moreover, there is a risk that we may be unable to compete effectively on price with such firms as their cost base may be lower, including regarding technological capabilities. In addition, new and existing competitors may be aided by technology that enables them to compete with our staffing services. The widespread adoption of sophisticated, automated job description and candidate screening tools could make many traditional functions of staffing companies obsolete. Specifically, the increased use of the internet may continue to attract technology-oriented companies to ----- the staffing industry. Free social networking sites such as LinkedIn and Facebook and online job boards such as Google for Jobs are also becoming a common way for recruiters and employees to connect without the assistance of a staffing company. We believe that our future success will depend largely upon our ability to anticipate and keep pace with these and other technological and digital developments and advances. Current or future competitors could develop alternative capabilities and technologies that are more effective, efficient, easier to use or more economical than our services. In addition, with continuing development and increased availability of information technology, the end-markets in which we compete may attract new competitors. If our capabilities and technologies do not keep up with advances, become obsolete or uncompetitive, this may lead to increased costs or not being able to find and match the right job candidates for clients, which may lead to loss of revenues and market share. We may face competition from our clients themselves as they insource or make alternative arrangements for some of the services we provide. SMEs and ISEs have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our sales. As such clients grow, they may increasingly take advantage of low-cost alternatives, including developing and using their own in-house resources rather than engaging a third party to support them in their staffing needs. Moreover, our clients, particularly our large corporate clients, may increasingly look for off-shore or near-shore labor markets as alternative sources for staffing as opposed to our staffing services, and such trend could accelerate as a result of the increase in remote working as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, there is a risk that we may not be able to maintain our existing client engagements and if we are not able to maintain or replace such clients, this could negatively impact our business. Due to competition, we may experience reduced margins on our services, loss of market share, and loss of clients. Our inability to compete effectively with current or future competitors as a result of any of the foregoing and other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",,,,N/A
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.1.5,Our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified job candidates and in-house employees.,"Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified job candidates who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the requirements of our clients, particularly for the specialized positions that we place under both our engineering and consulting and specialized talent solutions segments. Given the current global labor shortage in our primary markets, we may experience an increasingly tight labor market with low levels of unemployment, and there is a risk that we may be unable to meet our clients’ requirements in identifying an adequate number of job candidates. We must continually evaluate and upgrade our base of available qualified job candidates to keep pace with changing client needs and emerging technologies. Competition for individuals with proven specialty skills is often intense, and we expect demand for such individuals could make it difficult to retain such job candidates. Qualified job candidates may not be available to us in sufficient numbers or on terms of employment acceptable to us. In addition, we may lose existing job candidates to clients, if such clients decide to permanently retain our job candidates sent on temporary assignment, including as a result of legislative or regulatory reform. Additionally, our clients may look to us for assistance in identifying and integrating into their organizations job candidates from diverse backgrounds, and who may represent different generations, geographical regions and skill sets. These needs may change due to business requirements, or in response to geopolitical and societal trends. There is a risk that we may not be able to identify job candidates with the required attributes, including as a result of expanding restrictions on immigration or that our training programs may not succeed in developing effective or adequate skills to meet the demand where needed. We may also face difficulties in recruiting job candidates through our international recruitment network if such job candidates are not incentivized to relocate and seek assignments with clients in the markets in which we operate as a result of increasing wages in their home countries. In addition, the Covid-19 pandemic has led many job candidates to reevaluate their careers, work conditions and long-term professional goals, resulting in an increased rate of employees switching jobs and transitioning between different job modes. While this has led employers to focus more intensely than ever on employee retention and job mobility, which has created substantial opportunities for us to offer our services, there is no guarantee that we will be able to ----- capitalize on this trend. Employers and employees have also grown to be versatile during the Covid-19 pandemic and companies could seek to leverage flexible working arrangements to utilize their current employees to fill their staffing needs instead of seeking our services. Further, we are also dependent on our in-house employees to establish and maintain client relationships, to recruit job candidates, to run our day-to-day operations and to identify internal growth and external acquisition opportunities. A number of our Powerhouses rely on in-house employees who are specialists in the end-markets of the clients we serve with a deep understanding of the job requirements of our clients. Such qualified in-house employees may not continue to be available to us in sufficient numbers or on terms or in geographic locations which are economically and strategically advantageous to us. Moreover, we may be unable to continue to find, develop or retain suitable in-house employees who meet our performance standards. If we fail to recruit, train or retain qualified job candidates who meet the needs of our clients or in-house employees who meet our performance standards, our reputation, business and financial results could be materially adversely affected. Similarly, increases in compensation or in benefits resulting from competition for such qualified job candidates or in-house employees may have a material adverse effect on our current business, future prospects, financial condition and results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",,,,N/A

For example, rapid changes in the use of artificial intelligence and robotics are having a significant impact on some of the industries we serve, and could have significant and unforeseen consequences for the staffing industry and for our business. There is a risk that these, or other developments, could result in significant disruption to our business model, and that we will be unprepared to compete effectively. Additionally, our business is reliant on a variety of technologies, including those which support applicant on-boarding and tracking systems, order management, billing, payroll and client data analytics. There is a risk we will not sufficiently invest in technology or industry developments, or evolve our business with the right strategic investments, or at sufficient speed and scale, to adapt to changes in our marketplace. Similarly, from time to time we make strategic commitments to invest in or develop particular technologies to recruit, manage or analyze our workforce or support our business. In particular, we have developed several digital staffing solutions in recent years, and we intend to continue to invest in our digital initiatives. There is a risk that our digital initiatives will be unsuccessful as we may be unable to cater these digital solutions to the needs of employers or candidates, develop the technical aspects of these digital solutions quickly enough to keep pace with market trends or implement them effectively. Furthermore, we operate on a best practices basis, meaning that we implement digital initiatives more broadly among our Group once they have been tested by a Powerhouse, which may lead to delayed implementation of, and as a result, delayed benefit from, such initiatives. These and similar risks could have a negative effect on the appeal of our services and solutions, or our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace and, as a result, on our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",,,,N/A

Our senior management’s and key personnel’s knowledge of the market, our business, our clients and our Group ----- represents a key strength of our business model, and we believe that our experience and human capital serve as barriers to entry to potential competitors. Accordingly, we face risks relating to our ability to continue to attract, retain and incentivize senior management and other key personnel in our company. If any senior management or key personnel leave, it could take time to find appropriately qualified individuals to replace them especially considering the specialized nature of our business and the current tight labor market. If we are unable to retain key members of our senior management team in particular and cannot hire new qualified personnel in a timely manner, this could negatively impact the management of our Powerhouses and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",,,,N/A

We believe that maintaining, protecting and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide high-quality, useful and innovative services to our clients and our ability to successfully match job candidates with our clients’ needs. If clients or job candidates do not perceive our staffing services to be of high quality, our reputation could be harmed and the value of our brands could diminish, thereby decreasing the attractiveness of our staffing services to existing and prospective clients as well as job candidates. We also believe that our reputation and brands may be harmed if we fail to maintain a consistently high level of customer service. Our reputation and brand could also be negatively affected by the actions of clients or job candidates that are inappropriate or illegal, regardless of whether such actions relate to services we provide to such clients or arise while a job candidate is on assignment with a client if we are publicly associated with such actions. In addition, clients or job candidates may become dissatisfied with our billing policies, our handling of personal data or other aspects of our staffing services. If we fail to adequately address these or other complaints, negative publicity about us or our services could diminish confidence in and the use of our staffing services. Our image or reputation can be severely damaged even by isolated incidents, particularly if an incident receives considerable negative publicity or results in litigation, and such litigation may also directly affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Some of these incidents may include: - problematic in-house employee or job candidate behavior, such as social discrimination, violent behavior and sexual harassment, or disagreements or disputes with clients, job candidates or in-house employees; - placing job candidates who do not, or are alleged to not, have the requisite background or experience; - accidents that take place both within our own premises or at client sites; or - breaches or allegations of breaches of legal and regulatory obligations. Other incidents that may generate negative publicity or harm our reputation or brands may arise from events that are or may be beyond our control, such as data security breaches or fraudulent activities associated with our records, work accidents relating to job candidates placed with our clients, litigation and legal claims or third-party misappropriation, dilution or infringement of our intellectual property. For example, adverse publicity relating to workplace accidents, including serious injuries or fatal accidents, could have a negative impact on our business, including loss of existing job candidates or inhouse employees, loss of clients or regulatory action. Furthermore, negative publicity relating to the temporary staffing industry, the use of foreign workers, the housing of foreign workers or immigration/worker mobility more generally or the staffing industry more generally, whether or not directly or indirectly related to any specific events arising from our own operations, could harm our reputation through association, particularly if such negative publicity references us as an operator in ----- such industry or makes any of our clients or job candidates reluctant to use our services as a result. For example, in the past, we received negative publicity and were subject to litigation related to the failure of a third party to provide adequate housing arrangements for job candidates who were recruited through our international recruitment network. In addition, our German subsidiary SOLCOM has faced negative publicity in the past in connection with a dissatisfied former shareholder. Failure to address, or appearing to fail to address, these and other issues could erode client confidence in our reputation or the brands of our Powerhouses. Restoring our reputation may be costly and difficult to achieve. Negative publicity or negative public opinion may adversely affect our ability to retain and attract clients or job candidates, or increase the costs of attracting and maintaining our client and job candidate base, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",,,,N/A

In engaging in these data-related activities, we rely on our own technology and systems and those of thirdparty vendors we use for a variety of processes, including cloud-based technology and systems, mobile technologies and social media. Unauthorized disclosure, modification or loss of confidential, personally identifiable or sensitive data or other operational failures may occur through a variety of methods. These include, but are not limited to, systems failures, in-house employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or unauthorized access to or through our information systems, whether by our inhouse employees, vendors or third parties, or a cyber-attack by hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations. Computer malware, viruses, social engineering (predominantly spear phishing attacks), and general hacking have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and could occur on our systems in the future. We also regularly encounter attempts by third parties to fraudulently induce our in-house employees or job candidates to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or systems. An incident involving disclosure, data modification, loss or security breach or a significant technical failure could subject us to significant monetary damages or losses, litigation, negative publicity, regulatory enforcement actions, and liability under our contracts, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. In the past, we have experienced data security breaches resulting from unauthorized access to our systems, which to date have not had a material impact on our operations or financial results; however, there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future. Furthermore, we are subject to specific regulations regarding the use of personal data. Those regulations generally impose certain requirements on the Group in respect of the collection, retention, use and processing of such personal information. Specifically in the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) came into force and has applied directly to the legislation of all EU Member States since May 25, 2018, replacing historical EU data privacy laws, and implements more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data. Moreover, there are a large amount of socalled opening clauses, which could lead to differences between implementations of the GDPR in European Union Member States. The implementation of these requirements of the GDPR is a burden on the Group’s legal and compliance functions, in particular for international data transfers as they occur in our business. The task to meet all the GDPR requirements is relatively complex. Therefore, it is possible that we may be found to fail to meet certain requirements of the GDPR and its implementations by the Member States. In case we are found to infringe provisions set out in the GDPR, sanctions may be imposed. Our failure to implement the GDPR (including the implementing rules of the EU Member States) could affect our reputation and relationships with our clients, or result in ----- regulatory action against us for the infringement of data protection rules, any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position or results of operations. The GDPR imposes administrative fines for data protection compliance violations of up to a maximum of €20 million or 4% of the company’s global annual turnover. If the third parties we work with violate applicable laws or contractual obligations, or suffer a security breach, such violations may also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations and this could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business. Although we seek to ensure that procedures are in place to ensure compliance with the relevant data protection regulations by our inhouse employees and job candidates and any third-party service providers, and also implement security measures to help prevent cyber theft, we nonetheless are exposed to the risk that this data could be wrongfully appropriated, lost, disclosed, stolen or processed in breach of data protection legislation. Managing these risks have become more difficult in connection with working-from-home policies that we adopted in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic and exposes us to additional risk for which additional work, licenses and expertise is needed to detect and prevent the occurrences from happening. Ransomware and cyber risks have increased in general during the Covid-19 pandemic and have also required us to invest in even more strict back-up procedures, leading to higher operating costs for all of its information technologies. In addition, concerns regarding our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure or security of personal information or other privacy-related matters could result in negative publicity and have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",,,,N/A

Social media and online job boards have been an effective way for us to reach passive job seeker candidates and our success in these efforts depends, in part, upon our continued ability to promote our staffing services on third-party websites, such as Facebook, Google for Jobs and Indeed.com to whom we pay fees to advertise. If one of the advertisers or social media platforms to which we direct online advertising expenditures, use to promote our services or locate potential clients, were to increase their fees, change their interface or experience disruptions in service, we may be required to incur additional advertising expenses to acquire job candidates and clients. Furthermore, if any significant third-party websites or platforms on which we advertise, promote our services or locate potential clients were to lose their market position or otherwise fall out of favor with consumers or other factors cause their user bases to stop growing or shrink, we may need to identify alternative channels for advertising and promoting our staffing services, which could consume substantial resources and may not be effective, or available at all.

131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.1.15,"Given that many of our job candidates are employees on indefinite term contracts, an underutilization of such job candidates or any significant increase in staff costs or other direct costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.","Our Powerhouses regularly place medium to highly skilled job candidates who are engineers, technicians or other white-collar consultants with clients on a medium-term to long-term basis, and the job candidates in most of our engineering and consulting segment Powerhouses are employees with ----- indefinite term contracts on our payroll whether or not they are on assignment with a client. In addition, due to regulatory requirements, our job candidates in Germany are also our employees with indefinite term contracts and on our payroll whether or not they are on assignment with a client. In light of the above, the utilization of such job candidates (i.e., the time that can be billed to a client assignment) has a significant impact on the generation of our revenue. If such job candidates are underutilized, we will not be generating revenue, but we will continue to incur costs for these job candidates. Accordingly, the time for which job candidates are paid but cannot be billed to a client assignment, or “bench time,” has an impact on our profitability. The degree to which we are able to utilize and manage our job candidates is affected by a number of factors, including: - our ability to forecast demand for our services and to recruit, maintain and deploy job candidates in alignment with demand, including job candidates with the right mix of skills and experience to support client demand; - our ability to transition job candidates from completed client engagements to new assignments and to hire, assimilate and deploy new job candidates; - our ability to manage retention; - our ability to engage and motivate our job candidates and their level of productivity; and - performance, including through seeking out new clients engagements or extending existing clients engagements. A number of these factors have been more difficult to manage as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Although our business activities have been restored to or surpassed pre-Covid-19 levels, a number of our clients may still be uncertain of their staffing needs or hesitant to renew assignments for job candidates as the Covid-19 pandemic has changed the way how job candidates approach working. The war in Ukraine and the potential economic impact, as well as the global inflation and supply chain shortage have also caused uncertainties on how companies fill their staffing requirements. Furthermore, while temporary unemployment government measures implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic allowed us to manage certain of our costs that come from underutilized job candidates, a number of these measures, however, ended during the course of 2021, and the remaining measures expired as of July 2022. Moreover, the significant economic volatility in today’s market, despite the recovery in GDP growth for our geographical market following the Covid-19 pandemic, may lead to a reduction in the funding and/or willingness of customers to engage us for our services, which could in turn lead to an increase in underutilized job candidates. Increased direct costs (resulting from salary inflation for existing or new job candidates or an increase in headcount for our job candidates as part of our growth strategy or otherwise) without a corresponding increase in revenue could have a material adverse effect on our gross profit. While it is important for us to manage our additional client assignments or higher priced job candidate costs to maintain our gross margin, a failure to increase pay in line with our competitors could restrict our ability to attract new job candidates and retain existing job candidates, which could impact the quality of the services we provide to clients and our ability to win new or to maintain existing client relationships. If our costs increase at a higher rate than our revenue, whether due to factors that lead to less revenue (including as a result of our job candidates being underutilized) or factors that lead to increased costs, we may not be as competitive and profitability will be impacted. As a result, a material underutilization of our job candidates or an increase in costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",,,,N/A
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.1.16,Our interim results fluctuate as a result of seasonality in our business.,"----- Our revenue is subject to seasonal fluctuations in many of the end-markets in which we operate. We have in the past experienced, and expect in the future to experience fluctuations in our results of operations due to seasonal demand in our current end-markets. Seasonality varies depending on a number of different factors and can impact our Powerhouses and our two business segments differently. The underlying end-markets we serve are subject to various drivers that impact overall industry demand and therefore demand from our clients for staffing. For example, the construction industry may experience inclement weather or other causes on a worksite, which can impact demand for job candidates. As a result of the mix of services we provide, seasonal work can also cause a peak in demand during a specific period, such as the weeks leading up to Christmas and Easter, around harvest time in the food production sector or around holiday periods such as the Christmas holidays and summer holidays. Historically, as a general matter, our revenue fluctuates, with higher levels of revenue typically being received in the second half of the year just after the summer holidays, which is then sustained for a period before decreasing again in December due to Christmas holidays. We also present certain unaudited monthly revenue and _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA financial information in this Offering Memorandum for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 derived from management accounts, which typically display more seasonality and may be subject to adjustment at quarter-end, and therefore investors should exercise caution when placing reliance thereon. Moreover, we also experience seasonality with regard to our working capital requirements. We generally experience larger working capital requirements in the first half of the year due to increased holiday pay, bonus pay and tax payments. While our working capital requirements are generally lower in the second half of the year, our working capital requirements also experience an increase at the end of the year for end-of year bonuses and holiday pay, particularly as certain of our businesses institute mandatory holiday at the end of the year. Furthermore, our results during 2020 were also impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, which affected the traditional seasonality patterns experienced by the Group with respect to revenue and with respect to working capital (with a number of governments granting postponements to certain tax or other expenses and providing grants for certain unemployment support that temporarily decreased the Group’s working capital needs) compared to previous years.",,,,N/A

Controls over financial reporting have inherent limitations, including human error or inaccuracies in recording information or transferring information into systems, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, a lack of requisite personnel, lack of segregated duties or controls, fraud or because of our decentralized structure across smaller business units. Because of these inherent limitations, controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. In addition, our organizational structure may make it difficult to implement changes across business units in a consistent manner, including those required for internal control, other controls and compliance. We could also face difficulties in bringing the controls, accounting procedures and policies of the companies that we acquire up to the standard of our controls and procedures in time for the reporting cycle following an acquisition, which could lead to inaccuracies or misstatements in our financial reporting. If we cannot maintain or execute adequate controls over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, fail to meet our reporting requirements on a timely basis, be unable to properly report on our business or our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements.

131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.1.18,We face risks associated with the collection of trade receivables and certain counterparty risk.,"----- Trade receivables constitute a significant portion of our assets and are therefore a major business investment. As of December 31, 2021 and as of September 30, 2022, trade receivables constituted 11.6% and 13.8%, respectively, of our total assets. Successful control of the trade receivables process demands the development of appropriate credit, collection, and financing policies. In addition, we are exposed to credit risk, meaning the risk that our clients and other counter-parties may be unable to fulfill their payment obligations. Macroeconomic conditions have a significant influence on credit risk, as in an economic downturn more clients tend to fall into default, which could be magnified for us as a result of our exposure to SME and ISE clients, which may have less ability to raise capital from other sources during a downturn. Since the outbreak of Covid-19 in the markets in which we operate, a number of businesses, particularly small businesses, have been supported by government measures. It cannot be excluded that as the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic continues or once these government measures expire, such businesses, including our clients supported by such measures, may face cash flow shortages or bankruptcy, which could impact our ability to collect trade receivables in a timely manner or at all, particularly for those receivables which would not be covered by the Group’s credit insurance, which has a maximum liability amount of up to €250.0 million and is held by all of our Powerhouses, except for Cohedron and TMI. If our clients become unable to pay amounts owed to us, or pay us more slowly, then our cash flow and profitability may suffer. We are also exposed to counterparty risk with respect to certain credit insurance maintained by certain of our business units, swap agreements we have entered into in respect of interest payments as well as factoring agreements (for which our Group retains a credit risk and late payments risk). Financial services institutions and other counterparties are inter-related because of trading, funding, clearing or other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about the financial stability of one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to market-wide liquidity disruptions, losses and defaults. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by one or more of our counterparties. If we fail to maintain a solid collections policy or to manage our credit risk or if there were such an economic downturn in the markets in which we operated or an impact on the financial services markets including our counterparties, such a failure or event could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",,,,N/A

We may, however, become subject to liability against which we have not been insured, cannot insure or are insufficiently insured, such as employment practices liability, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. For example, to the extent any claims arise during a job candidate’s assignment with a client which we expected the clients’ insurance to cover and it does not, we may face uninsured losses in connection with any such events. In addition, we may not be able to enter into new insurance agreements on commercially acceptable terms and conditions in the future. For example, our business units in Belgium are required to insure occupational accidents through specifically licensed private insurance companies, as a consequence of the Law of April 10, 1971 and subsequent Royal Decrees. Furthermore, following the outbreak of Covid-19 in the markets in which we operate, a number of insurance companies have increased or may attempt to raise insurance prices, which we may not be able to fully recover by passing along these increased expenses in our negotiations of client contracts and fees for our job candidates’ services. Given the nature of our operations, which typically results in us placing our job candidates on our payroll while they are on assignment, we are required to insure a significant number of persons. Since 2021, a variable premium rate has been applied to our work accident insurance, with a base premium rate of 2.918%, a mid-case rate of 3.064% and ----- worst-case rate of 3.097%, depending on the number of work accidents we have. This premium is calculated based on the gross salary mass of our temporary workers. For 2021, we estimate that the mid-case rate will apply, although the base premium rate could potentially still apply depending on the recovery process of the individuals involved in work accidents, which would have a significant impact on the calculation of the final compensation to be paid out and therefore impact the premium rate that will be applied to us. We also estimate that the mid-case rate will apply for 2022, and at the moment we are on course for the base premium rate; however, this expectation could change drastically depending on any further occurrences of work accident in the remainder of 2022. The materialization of any of these risks may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",,,,N/A
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.1.20,Changes in sentiment toward the staffing industry could affect demand for our services.,"From time to time, the staffing industry has come under criticism from unions, works councils, regulatory agencies, governments and other constituents that maintain that labor and employment protections, such as wage and benefits regulations, are subverted by staffing services, particularly temporary staffing services. Our business is dependent on the continued acceptance of staffing arrangements as a source of flexible labor for our clients. If attitudes or business practices in some locations change due to pressure from organized labor, political groups, or regulatory agencies, or alternatively due to increased use of and preference for online job platforms and other digital intermediaries which results in decreased demand for our services from clients, we could experience a decline in revenue. For example, temporary staffing is generally impermissible in Germany without a valid permit from the relevant authorities, and there can be no guarantee that regulations in our other primary markets will not change in the future to prohibit the same. Also, new legislation has come into effect in the Netherlands requiring employment housing to remain available for four weeks following the end of employment of foreign workers, which has also led to an increased focus on separation between employment providers and housing providers. While this separation is not currently legally required, we expect it will be enforced in the future. Notwithstanding the above, there is currently no clear indication as to the extent of what the required separation will be, and we cannot be certain at this time whether a complete separation, or a full ban on the provision of housing to temporary workers by employment agencies, will be legally required in the future and how that would impact the demand for our services. In addition, the use of foreign workers by the staffing industry is also criticized and may receive significant political, media or other attention from time to time. To the extent that this decreases demand for our staffing requires, this could also result in a decline in revenue for the Group. In particular, demand for our services from government and public sector clients related to the Covid19 pandemic may decrease over time. On July 20, 2021, we acquired Cohedron, which primarily advises public authorities and municipalities and is currently a Powerhouse in our engineering and consulting segment. We have increased business from services rendered to the government and public sector clients during the Covid-19 pandemic due to, among other developments, work related to government support measures, such as the TOZO scheme, as well as concerns related to the widespread personal debt issue of the citizens in the Netherlands. The Covid-19 pandemic-related services and other work for government and public sector clients has contributed to our revenue over the past year. It is unknown to what extent business with such clients may decrease as the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic lessen or change over time. Demand for our services from government and public sector clients may also fall as clients adapt to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and their needs evolve. We will continue to monitor the situation, but the future impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and its effects on the needs of our clients are impossible to fully predict, and there can be no assurance that our increased business in the government and public sector will be sustained.

As required by IFRS, we test material assets annually for impairment. We have not experienced any material impairments of goodwill during the three years ended December 31, 2021. We performed an impairment test during the second quarter of 2022 given the rising interest rate in the current market, which we consider to be an impairment indicator. Goodwill impairment in relation to the GRITT Powerhouse was identified, as the recoverable amount was €40.9 million compared to the carrying value of €54.2 million. We performed another impairment test during the third quarter of 2022 due to further increases in interest rates, and identified no additional impairments. We therefore recorded a goodwill impairment of €13.3 million for the nine months ending September 30, 2022, as we consider this change to have a long-term impact. If we have any indication that the value of any of our material assets could decline, including indicators such as an economic downturn, the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its consequential economic impact or certain business decisions, this results in an impairment test that could result in impairments of goodwill or of other current or non-current assets, and if any such impairments were substantial, this would negatively impact our operating profit. Any significant charge for impairment in the future could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or result of operations and thus our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees. In addition, following the Transactions, we will account for the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with IFRS 3 (Business Combinations).

In order to efficiently manage these contractual relationships at each of our business units, we employ general terms and conditions and standard templates in our contracts and forms. Furthermore, certain of our business units work with a number of large corporate clients and are sometimes required to adhere to their standard terms and conditions. As a result of the foregoing, we are exposed to legal risks whenever such contracts contain drafting errors, execution errors (including unsigned agreements), lack sufficient detail on the nature of our liability to the client, require customized terms and conditions, or require additional analysis as to legal sufficiency. Such general terms and conditions, standard contracts and forms used and signed by us may not comply with all the applicable legal requirements at all times. Moreover, as our in-house employees receive incentivelinked pay, they could agree to non-standard terms in a bid to sign on new clients which may expose us to additional liabilities. In addition, certain agreements with our clients contain indemnifications and hold harmless obligations in favor of our clients. We are not always able to contractually exclude or limit such potential claims and certain of our contracts therefore bear the risk of uncapped liability, including certain agreements with our large corporate clients.

131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,1.1.23,A significant portion of our revenue is derived from SME and ISE clients and we could be negatively impacted by the costs associated by providing such service or adverse market conditions or other factors that affect our SME and ISE clients.,"Our client portfolio is mainly composed of SMEs and ISEs, which have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our sales. Key challenges we face in providing services to the SME and ISE market include: - serving as the expert in staffing needs to organizations that often lack internal HR resources and ensuring our services meet their needs in terms of support, flexible decision making and excellence in customer service; - devoting resources to advise our SME and ISE clients on compliance with applicable labor regulations, including health and safety requirements; - investing in client relationships takes time and staffing assignments with SMEs and ISEs may require more of such investment since typical average staffing needs may be for only one to two job candidates at a time; and - devoting significant resources to developing services tailored to their needs, standards and specific requirements. Furthermore, an economic downturn in the end-markets in which our SME and ISE clients operate could have a negative impact on the demand for our services or the prices such clients are willing to pay for our services. The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the results of operations and financial viability of SMEs and ISEs as many have had their trading interrupted due to lockdowns and typically businesses of such size have difficulty accessing debt and equity financing. Although certain government programs have been established to assist SMEs and ISEs, we can provide no assurance that these schemes will be sufficient and a number of them have been, or may be in the future discontinued, and as a result many SMEs and ISEs may be in danger of closing. Therefore, while lockdown measures have lifted or eased, many of our SME and ISE clients may still be facing significant difficulties in recovering from the economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The current inflationary environment may also pose further financial pressure on our SME and ISE clients as they may be less likely to be able to pass-through higher operational costs to their customers, which may impact their demand for our services or the prices they are willing to pay us. As a result, our focus on SMEs and ISEs could result in additional costs to the Group as compared to our peers that are less focused on the SME and ISE market. Conditions or developments that affect SMEs and ISEs in particular, which may be related to macroeconomic factors, including inflation, regulatory developments, consumer trends or other factors leading to a material decline in SMEs’ and ISEs’ demand for staffing services could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",,,,N/A
131,Preliminary Offerings 2022.pdf,1,RISK FACTORS,1.2,Risks Relating to Legal Matters and the Regulatory Environment,1.2.1,We are subject to extensive laws and regulations which may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and may reduce our future earnings.,"In many jurisdictions in which we operate, such as Belgium and Germany, the employment services industry is heavily regulated. These laws and regulations sometimes limit the size and growth of ----- employment services industries in these countries. Some of the laws and regulations impact directly our profitability; for example, the 2008 EU Directive of Temporary Agency Work seeks to guarantee those working through staffing solutions providers equal pay and conditions with employees in the same business who perform the same job duties, which led to an increase in our cost of services. Some other laws and regulations restrict our sector expansion; for example, the use of staffing services by staffing solutions providers in the local construction end-market is prohibited in Germany. Furthermore, in April 2017, Germany enacted legislation introducing equal pay for temporary workers as well as restricting the length of temporary employment to 18 months, which led to a downturn in our business and an adverse impact to our operating results due to the overtaking of temporary workers by clients, and which legislation has continued to have an impact in subsequent periods. While we have systems and processes in place to monitor our compliance with such laws, it is possible such systems could fail which could have a negative impact on our financial results or reputation. In addition, substantial changes to Dutch law governing temporary staffing came into effect from January 1, 2020. These changes to regulation had some impact on our business, as they resulted in the costs for temporary work increasing. For example, there are increased social security charges for temporary staffing agencies in their capacity as employer, and we expect a formal separation between employment providers and housing providers will be legally required in the future. Furthermore, payroll employees will be entitled to all terms and conditions as the client’s employees in similar positions, and a temporary employment clause and the additional flexibility to enter into fixed term employment agreements that are traditionally allowed are no longer applicable to payroll employees. As a result of these regulations coming into effect in 2020, our cost of services has increased, but we also simultaneously increased our sales prices for our job candidates’ services. While to date we have been able to pass on the majority of these increases in costs to our clients through higher fees charged for our services, this nevertheless leads to an increased cost for our services at clients, which may lead to clients questioning the relatively higher cost of temporary/flexible staffing versus hiring permanent employees, thus reducing their demand for our services. The impact of these changes cannot yet be fully ascertained as it is still evolving following the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, and while companies have demonstrated increased demand for hiring flexibility in the current market, many of them have also become more focused on cost savings, leading to less use of temporary work. In some countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of our job candidates. For example, as a consequence of certain legal restrictions, certain deductions are not allowed if the net salary paid to job candidates falls below minimum wage as a result. For these nondeductible costs, we send invoices to the workers. If workers do not pay their invoices and return to their country of origin, we are left with the costs. Furthermore, changes in zoning regulations or their interpretation could result in increased costs in order to house our job candidates. Covid-19 related government measures relating to quarantine regulations and separate housing requirements for job candidates at certain of our Powerhouses have also resulted in increased housing costs for job candidates. Additionally, trade unions may use the political process to target our industry in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expenses associated with offering or utilizing temporary staffing workforce solutions. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in our business. Furthermore, many countries are also expanding restrictions on immigration and have introduced substantial penalties that may be imposed on staffing solutions providers and their client for employing foreign workers without necessary work and residence permits. As a result, there is a risk that we may incur greater expense in connection with restrictions imposed on recruiting foreign workers. In addition, the countries and territories in which we operate may, among other things: - create additional regulations that prohibit or restrict the types of employment services that we currently provide; - require that new or additional benefits be paid to our job candidates; ----- - increase payroll related costs such as general and medical insurance, workers’ compensation; - require us to comply with additional social laws, including in relation to collective bargaining procedures; - require us to obtain additional licensing to provide employment services; - limit the circumstances under which temporary staff may be employed; - reclassify the status or categorization of our job candidates under applicable social laws which would require us to comply with additional requirements, including payment of additional welfare benefits; or - increase taxes such as sales or value-added taxes. In some countries, we are able to utilize laws, regulations or governmental measures that incentivize work and employment through governmental support programs, subsidies or other specific measures which help generate demand for our staffing services and provide opportunities for us to place job candidates or to be reimbursed for certain of their wages or salary costs by placing them in work. These governmental programs include those supporting shift work, night work, students and training, amongst others. If these programs are discontinued, there may be less demand for our staffing services. In addition, should we or the administrator responsible for such programs determine as a result of reviews, control procedures or otherwise that any of our job candidates or the work opportunity do not meet the eligibility criteria for such programs after we have placed them, we may not be eligible for any subsidies for such job candidates’ wages or salaries or we could be required to reimburse the government for any subsidies that were already received, which could have a negative impact on our profits. Furthermore, we also benefitted from temporary government measures introduced as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, which have since expired and such expiration resulted in limited increased costs to the Group. Any future regulations or interpretations from administrations thereof may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations because they may make it more difficult or expensive for us to continue to provide employment services (such as by increasing employment taxes), particularly if we cannot pass on increases in costs to our clients. For example, on December 17, 2020, the Dutch government approved a new law that aims to curb nitrogen emission, which has had an impact on the Dutch agricultural sector given the country’s large amount of livestock, and, in turn, caused the demand of our job candidates in this sector to fluctuate. Belgium has also passed similar nitrogen emission-related legislation, which could have an adverse impact on our business there as well. In addition, on April 21, 2021, the European Commission presented a proposal for a Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”), which would amend the existing reporting requirements of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive and encourage corporate spending towards sustainable activities across the EU. The European Council approved the CSRD on November 28, 2022 and the application of the regulation is expected to take place in four stages, the first of which will require companies that already fall under the CSRD to complete their first CSRD reporting on the financial year 2024, with expected reporting deadlines in 2025. We expect that we will be required to comply with the CSRD. We cannot guarantee how the new Dutch nitrogen regulation, the CSRD or any other existing or potential environmental regulations will impact our governance structure and our day-today business activities. Future changes to regulations may have more stringent requirements that could increase our cost of operations or impact the demand of our services, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and in turn impact our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",,,,N/A

In the event of non-compliance, our existing permits and licenses may be revoked or we may be subject to a fine, and re-application for such permits and licenses may be prohibited or may require us to incur significant cost and expense. For example, we are currently being investigated by Belgian authorities for allegedly providing residential housing units that do not meet the required quality of living standards. On October 31, 2022, the court of first instance ruled in our favor, but the prosecutor has appealed and we expect the court of appeal to hear the case in 2023. Although we believe any potential financial fines resulting from such investigations would not be material to our overall business, such investigation could lead to a potential review and change of status of our temporary worker agency license. Should the status of our license change, some of our clients might prefer not to work with us until our license is restored to its previous status. Certain of our licenses are also subject to periodic renewal. If the regulatory approvals required for such transfers are not obtained, are delayed or are economically prevented, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees. We also maintain various client quality certifications which authorize certain of our Powerhouses, such as, among others, Abylsen, GRITT and Redmore, to supply services to our clients. A failure to renew these quality certifications in future audits may cause us to lose existing clients and threaten our ability to attract new clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",,,,N/A

As a result, our job candidates working in these end-markets, including, in particular the construction, infrastructure and defense sectors, may be subject to accidents at work, some of which have in the past and could in the future, result in injuries, including severe ones causing disability or even death. In certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we may be liable to our job candidates for damages or subject to regulatory action as a result of unsafe working conditions at the client’s premises. We could also be liable toward our job candidates or subject to regulatory action or loss of our license to the extent we do not meet legal requirements with respect to such placement, for example submitting job candidates to a medical examination for applicable placements in advance of the job candidate beginning work. Furthermore, any failures of such standards by our clients or ourselves that generate adverse publicity could have a negative impact on our reputation and our ability to attract future business, result in the loss of existing job candidates affected by any such behavior or otherwise harm our business or operations. In circumstances where a liability arises as a result of the actions of a client, we may be ----- unable to recuperate or bring a claim in respect of any sums that we have paid in connection with the relevant claim. Any failure to comply with the existing, or any future, standards applicable to our clients may result in civil claims, criminal liability, regulatory action and penalties against us or our directors or managers. For example, the labor inspectorate in Belgium is currently conducting an investigation into one of our Powerhouses in Belgium for alleged criminal negligence in respect of health and safety legislation relating to a fatal accident of a temporary worker on customer premises. Should we be found liable, we could face fines, temporary or permanent restrictions on engaging in certain activities, and temporary or permanent closures of one or more sites. Any such action could also lead to liability for our directors or managers, which could, in turn, damage our reputation and impact our ability to participate in public tenders for this Powerhouse. Any failure to prevent a health or safety risk from occurring and causing damage or loss may materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.",,,,N/A

These may include possible claims by clients or regulatory bodies against us relating to: - classification of temporary workers; - employment of undocumented workers; - failing to verify job candidates’ backgrounds and qualifications; - job candidates’ misconduct or negligence; or - fraudulent or criminal job candidate activities or misuse of client proprietary information. We may also be subject to claims by job candidates or regulatory bodies (including in relation to actions of our clients or any third parties that we hire). Some of these may include claims relating to: - violations of labor laws such as minimum wage requirements: - discrimination and harassment; - wrongful termination or denial of employment; - violations of employment rights related to employment screening or privacy issues; - violation of social laws, such as provision of adequate housing for foreign workers; or - payment of workers’ compensation claims or other health and safety related claims. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we bring claims or may be pursuing other legal or regulatory remedies. We are involved in contractual relationships with our clients and other third parties that may cause us from time to time, by court order or by unilateral action, to enforce our contractual rights against these parties. These claims may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged losses, civil penalties or injunctive or declaratory relief. If any such claim is ultimately resolved unfavorably, and we are required to bear all or a portion of the costs arising from such proceedings, we may not receive compensation we were expecting, be required to incur additional expenses may be less effective at enforcing our agreements in the future. For example, the founder and former Chief Executive Officer of one of our Powerhouses in France, who we dismissed for cause, brought two claims against us alleging that he is entitled for additional ----- monetary payment for certain shares that he owned in the French Powerhouse of which he was CEO and for certain shares he owned in House of HR. Although we believe that he is not entitled to such additional payment as a result of him having been dismissed for cause, should he prevail in his claim, our maximum potential exposure is €15.0 million. A decision is expected during the course of the first quarter of 2023. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.” In addition, SOLCOM has been a subject in investigations by customs authorities in relation to suspected de-facto employment of freelancers. The investigations were closed in 2021, and while it was concluded that no criminal offenses were committed and none of the freelancers were deemed employees, we paid a total of €4.0 million to the German pension insurance and the public prosecutor’s office in 2021 to minimize procedural costs. Accent was also challenged in 2017 by the Belgian tax authorities for an alleged tax fraud relating to a Luxembourgish construction in for activities prior to 2014, which Accent ultimately settled with the Belgian tax authorities. Furthermore, there is currently a pending case before the European Court of Justice regarding certain German staffing legislations, which stems from a law suit against TIMEPARTNER concerning a labor law violation, which TIMEPARTNER previously won in two instances. All parties involved in this case have provided statements, and we believe that the court may take six to 14 months to issue a decision. We may be subject to other litigation and disputes, claims and complaints, including adversarial actions, by clients, in-house employees, suppliers, insurers and others in the ordinary course of business, which may have a material impact on our results of operations, liquidity, capital resources or financial position. Significant claims or a substantial number of small claims may be expensive to defend, may divert the time and focus of management away from our operations and may result in our having to pay monetary damages, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality, license and other contractual agreements and patent, copyright, and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We also rely on certain license agreements from third parties to utilize software or other intellectual property used within our businesses. For example, certain of our business units rely on proprietary software that we have developed internally or acquired, such as NOWJOBS, SWOP, Book’u, CV Creator, MyTests, Dora, MyTools and Gighouse, as part of our digital initiatives strategy. Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing services and solutions similar to ours or from using similar software to ours. In certain jurisdictions, such as Belgium, we also rely on a favorable tax regime on copyright incomes to attract creative software developers. In Belgium, an ongoing reform will make the favorable tax regime subject to stricter conditions. This may affect our ability to attract or keep software developers. Furthermore, the steps we take may not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former in-house employees or other third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees. We can also not be sure that our services and solutions do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties. Third parties, including competitors, may assert intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or invalidity claims against us that could be upheld. ----- Intellectual property litigation, which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us, may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights, including trade secrets or proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement or misappropriation of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of our or others’ intellectual property or proprietary rights. We may not prevail in any such litigation, and if we are unsuccessful, we may be subject to monetary liability and injunctive or equitable relief, which may prevent our use of others’ intellectual property or proprietary rights if we are not able to obtain the necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all.

The tax bases and rates of these jurisdictions change from time to time due to economic, political and other conditions. Revisions to tax legislation or to its interpretation (whether with prospective or retrospective effect) may also affect our results, and significant judgment is required in determining our provision for taxes. Furthermore, political, media or other attention may result in increased examination of our structures by tax or other ----- authorities. Our tax liabilities and effective tax rate are affected by changes in earnings in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the respective tax laws and changes in our business. In addition, tax accounting involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our provision for income and other taxes and tax assets and liabilities. These complex matters include transfer pricing and reporting relating to intercompany transactions. We often rely on generally available interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. There cannot be certainty that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these laws. We are routinely subject to tax examinations by the tax authorities and in the past have been required to pay adjustments as a result of the findings of such examinations, including for additional social security payments for job candidates. In such audits, our interpretation of tax legislation may be challenged and tax authorities in various jurisdictions may disagree with, and subsequently challenge, the amount of profits taxed in such jurisdictions. In certain of our jurisdictions, we may also be subject to criminal penalties if the tax authorities find us to be in contravention of the applicable legislation. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcome of any such audits and related litigation could be different from any of our provisions for taxes and may have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.

The objectives of the due diligence process are to identify attractive investment opportunities based on the facts and circumstances relevant to a specific asset, to identify possible risks associated with such asset and to prepare a framework that may be used from the date of the acquisition of such asset to drive operational achievement and value creation in such asset. When conducting due diligence, the Sponsor typically evaluates a number of important business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental and legal issues in determining whether or not to proceed with an investment. Outside consultants, legal advisors, accountants and investment banks are involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment. Nevertheless, when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment, the Sponsor relies on resources available to it, including information provided by the target of the investment and, in some circumstances, third party investigations. Instances of bribery, fraud, accounting irregularities, contingent liabilities and other improper, illegal or corrupt practices can be difficult to detect, and fraud and other deceptive practices can be widespread in certain jurisdictions. There may be liabilities that the Sponsor failed or was unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations into House of HR and its affiliates in connection with the Acquisition, in particular given the timing constraints for, and the materiality thresholds that have been applied in the context of, the due diligence investigations.

Prior to the Conversion Date (as defined under “Description of Other Indebtedness—Bridge Facility Agreement”), loans under the Bridge Facility will initially bear interest at rates per annum equal to EURIBOR plus an applicable margin (subject to a zero floor if less than zero). These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. None of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement, the Second Lien Facility Agreement or the Indenture contains a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt. Although we have entered into and maintain, and we intend to enter into additional, hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging ----- arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. If one or more of our counterparties falls into bankruptcy, claims we have under the swap agreements or other hedging arrangements may become worthless.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement permit, and the Indenture will permit, additional indebtedness to be secured on the Collateral in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will only enforce the Collateral as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and the Indenture regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. Prior to the Issuer designating any liabilities as Super Senior Liabilities in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (such date of designation (if any), the “Designation Date”), the Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that consists of the holders of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, the senior lenders, creditors in respect of indebtedness ranking pari passu with the senior creditors and creditors in respect of certain non-priority hedging obligations (the “Senior Secured Credit Participations”) which aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations at that time (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”) (in each case acting through their respective creditor representatives). If the Majority Senior Secured Creditors do not instruct the Security Agent to enforce, or instruct the Security Agent to cease enforcing the transaction security, then, in certain cases, creditors holding more than 50% of the total second lien credit participations (or, in certain cases, creditors holding 50% of the total Topco credit participations) may instruct the Security Agent to enforce. Following the Designation Date, the Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that may consist of either (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or (ii) creditors holding more than 50% of the total participations in Super Senior Liabilities at that time (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”). The Security Agent is required to act in accordance with instructions received from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, however: (i) if and to the extent the obligations under the Super Senior Liabilities have not been fully discharged in cash within six months of enforcement instructions first being issued by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors; or (ii) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to purse within three months of enforcement instructions first being issued by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors, then the enforcement instructions provided by the Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail. Following the transaction security having become enforceable, if (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue and (ii) (x) the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith that to delay issuing enforcement instructions could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any transaction security or the realization of enforcement proceeds and (y) deliver enforcement instructions which they reasonably believe to be consistent with the enforcement principles and necessary or desirable to enhance the prospects of achieving the enforcement objectives before the Security Agent has received any enforcement instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, in such circumstances, the Security Agent shall act in accordance with the enforcement instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors. ----- If at any time an insolvency event has occurred with respect to any debtor (other than an insolvency event which is the direct result of any action taken by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors) and is continuing, the Security Agent shall act (i) prior to the Designation Date, in accordance with the instructions of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (without any requirement to first consult with any junior creditors) or (ii) after the Designation Date and to the extent the Majority Super Senior Creditors have provided such instructions, in accordance with the instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors. The Security Agent is not obliged to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of its duties, obligations or responsibilities or the exercise of any right, power, authority or discretion if it has grounds for believing the repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against, or security for, such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it by a member of the Group. In connection with any enforcement instructions received by it, the Security Agent may request security and/or indemnity and/or prefunding satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense (including legal fees). To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes (such as indebtedness incurred as an additional facility under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement), the voting interest of holders of the Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we incur. Creditors of any future Super Senior Liabilities may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Transaction Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral consisting of the shares of the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Note Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such entities securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees may be released.

See “Description of the Notes—Security.” In the event of an enforcement of the security interests in respect of the Collateral following an event of default, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been, or will be, made in connection with this Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers. ----- In addition, the Collateral will secure the Facilities and the Bridge Facility and may secure certain future indebtedness of the Group. Not all of our assets will secure the Notes and the Indenture will allow the Issuer and its subsidiaries to secure certain indebtedness (which may be structurally senior to the Notes and the Note Guarantees) with the property and assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries that do not secure the Notes. The value of such assets and property could be significant. If an event of default occurs and the obligations under the Notes are accelerated, the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of other unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer and their restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property or assets excluded from the Collateral securing the Notes. While the Indenture will create certain obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional security over assets, or a particular class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, such obligations will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain important exemptions and carve-outs. The Agreed Security Principles that will be set forth in the Indenture will include a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Notes to be granted security or guarantees in certain circumstances. The operation of the Agreed Security Principles may result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any security provided being limited or security not being granted over a particular type or class of assets. See “Description of the _Notes—Security.” Accordingly, the Agreed Security Principles may affect the value of the security or_ guarantees provided by the Issuer and the Guarantors. The shares and other Collateral that will be pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of such collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate include restrictions on persons who may hold certain of our licenses, authorizations and consents that are necessary to operate our business. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Transaction Security Documents, enforcement of the Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur, and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets do not secure the Notes and it is possible that the value of the Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees thereof, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. The Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the Transaction Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional Notes under the Indenture or incur additional indebtedness, including indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, holders of such Notes or ----- lenders of such debt would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Collateral.",,,,N/A

See “Description of Other _Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”_ In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral will be subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over such Collateral are taken. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors owed to holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (“Principal Obligations”). All or part of the pledges and other security interests in such jurisdictions will be granted to the Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent.

In the event that any one or more of ----- the Issuer, the Guarantors or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer, the enforceability of a Note Guarantee against any of the Guarantors and the enforceability of the Security Interests. In certain circumstances the court may also void the Security Interest or the Note Guarantee if the company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Note Guarantee or the Security Interests provided by such security provider; - direct that the Issuer and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Note Guarantee or any Security Interest to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to you. If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Note Guarantee or Security Interest is found to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor or security provider under its Note Guarantee or the Security Interests will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors and security providers under the Transaction Security Documents will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each of the Guarantors or security providers under its Note Guarantee or the Security Interests, as applicable. There is also the possibility that the entire Note Guarantee or Security Interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See also “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance _and other limitations on the Note Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Collateral.”_ In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Note Guarantees were issued, or the Security Interests created, the relevant Guarantor or security provider: - issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its insolvency; - issued such Note Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent business person as a shareholder of such Guarantor or security provider would have contributed equity to such Guarantor or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Note ----- Guarantee or Security Interest knew or should have known that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made; or - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Note Guarantee or Security Interest on the basis that the Note Guarantee or Security Interest were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Note Guarantee or the creation of the Security Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due. Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Note Guarantee or created any Security Interest if: - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute; or - its liabilities exceed the liquidation value of its assets, unless it has a positive going concern prognosis. Although we believe that the Issuer and the other Guarantors are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or security provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Note Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date its Note Guarantee was issued or the Security Interests were created, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

Enforcement of the obligations under a Note Guarantee against, and/or any security provided by, as applicable, any such Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or similar laws as well as regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally, particularly by limiting the amounts recoverable under the Note Guarantees and Collateral, as applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security provider under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Note Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of ----- such Note Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or such Note Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such subsidiary Guarantor or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. The Note Guarantees and/or security interests granted by a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbH”) or a partnership with a GmbH as liable partner (i.e., a GmbH & Co. KG) for the purpose of guaranteeing or securing liabilities of its direct or indirect shareholders or a subsidiary of such shareholders (excluding direct or indirect subsidiaries of such GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG) are considered to constitute a benefit for such shareholder and therefore are subject to certain capital maintenance and liquidity maintenance rules. Therefore, any Note Guarantees provided by a GmbH will be subject to certain contractual limitations (so called “limitation language”) contained in the Indenture (or any other document under which any Note Guarantee is granted) and that are or will be contained in the Transaction Security Documents, respectively, designed to ensure compliance with applicable capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or any other general statutory laws. These principles apply mutatis mutandis to a GmbH & Co. KG. Any guarantee and/or security interest granted by a GmbH or any other entity incorporated/established under the laws of Germany may be held invalid pursuant to Section 138 BGB and would therefore not be enforceable if, at the time of the creation or enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security interest, among others, the third party creditor and the affiliate have acted in fraudulent conveyance (kollusives Zusammenwirken) to the detriment of the GmbH or other third party creditors of the GmbH. As a result, the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s liability under its Note Guarantee or Collateral could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law and contractual enforcement restrictions applicable to it. This could lead to a situation in which such Note Guarantee or Collateral cannot be enforced at all. It is possible that a Guarantor or security provider, or any of their creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy or insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s Note Guarantee or the security provider’s Collateral on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Note Guarantee or Collateral should be limited or voided. To the extent that any limitations on the relevant Note Guarantees or Collateral apply, the Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or security provider, including trade payables of such Guarantor or security provider. Future Note Guarantees and Collateral may be subject to similar limitations. The proceeds of the enforcement of said guarantees and/or security interests will be distributed amongst the guaranteed and/or secured creditors (including, without, limitation, the holders of the Notes) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, the holders of the Notes will be able to recover limited amounts under the relevant Note Guarantees and security.

Interests in the global notes representing the Notes will trade in book-entry form only, and Notes in definitive registered form, or Definitive Registered Notes, will be issued in exchange for book-entry interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, will be the registered holders of the global notes representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the global notes representing the Notes will be made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the global Notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, the Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and if investors are not participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the Indenture. Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent it has received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis. Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry interests, they will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable.

The directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of, and substantially all of their assets are located outside of, the United States. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors. In addition, as a substantial portion of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and their subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them judgments obtained in U.S. courts. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of foreign jurisdictions would enforce (i) judgments of United States courts obtained against the Issuer and the Guarantors and the directors and executive officers who are not residents of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States federal and state securities laws or (ii) in original actions brought in such foreign jurisdictions against us or such persons predicated upon the United States federal and state securities laws.

In addition, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders of the Notes do not consent to the tender offer.","If a Change of Control (as defined under “Description of the Notes”) occurs, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to purchase all the outstanding Notes at a price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase. In such a situation, the Issuer may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Notes that are tendered under any such offer. If a significant principal amount of Notes is tendered, the Issuer will likely have to obtain financing to pay for the tendered Notes. However, the Issuer may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A change of control would entitle each lender under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement (individually) to cancel its commitments and require prepayment of amounts outstanding to it under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement, respectively, and could trigger put rights, mandatory prepayments or accelerations under other existing or future financing arrangements of the Group. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes upon a change of control would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility Agreement and the Second Lien Facility Agreement. The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers, recapitalizations or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, ----- may not constitute a change of control as defined in the Indenture.
