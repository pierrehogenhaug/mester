If a jurisdiction requires that this Offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the Initial Purchasers or any affiliate of the Initial Purchasers is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, this Offering shall be deemed to be made by the Initial Purchasers or such affiliate on behalf of the Issuer in such jurisdiction. Under no circumstances shall the Offering Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities, in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. Important Notice for Investors in the United Kingdom.** The Offering Memorandum has not been approved by an authorised person in the United Kingdom and is for distribution only to, and is only directed at, persons who (i) have professional experience in matters relating to investments (being investment professionals falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the ‘‘Financial Promotion Order’’)), (ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (‘‘high net worth companies, unincorporated associations etc.’’) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the ‘‘FSMA’’)) in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as ‘‘Relevant Persons’’). The Offering Memorandum is directed only at Relevant Persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not Relevant Persons. Any investment or investment activity to which the Offering Memorandum relates is available only to Relevant Persons and will be engaged in only with Relevant Persons. No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the securities other than in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer. The Offering Memorandum has been sent to you in electronic form. You are reminded that documents transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission and consequently none of the Initial Purchasers, any person who controls any Initial Purchaser, nor any of their respective subsidiaries, nor any directors, officers, employees or agents of theirs, or affiliates of the foregoing entities or persons, accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect of any difference between the Offering Memorandum distributed to you in electronic form and the hard copy version available to you from the Initial Purchasers upon your request. Notwithstanding the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union, any references in this document to European Union law should be treated as references to such law as applies in England and Wales from time to time including as retained, amended, extended, re-enacted or otherwise given effect on or after 11:00 pm on 31 January 2020. Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market:** Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the debt securities described in the Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such debt securities is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, ‘‘MiFID II’’); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such debt securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such debt securities (a ‘‘distributor’’) should take into consideration the Manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such debt securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors:** The debt securities described in the Offering Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (‘‘EEA’’) or in the United Kingdom (the ‘‘U.K.’’). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the ‘‘Insurance Distribution Directive’’), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the ‘‘Prospectus Regulation’’). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the ‘‘PRIIPs Regulation’’) for offering ----- or selling the debt securities described in the Offering Memorandum or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or in the U.K. has been prepared and therefore offering or selling such debt securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the U.K. may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of such debt securities in any member state of the EEA or in the U.K. will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of such debt securities. The Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

EBITDA for (i) the 2019 financial year and, where presented on a restated basis, the 2018 financial year gives effect to the application of IFRS 16 and the exclusion from our results of the results from discontinued operations and (ii) for the 2017 financial year and, where presented on an as originally reported basis, the 2018 financial year is presented on an IAS 17 basis and includes in our results the impact of discontinued operations. Underlying EBITDA reflects adjustments to EBITDA to exclude the impact of certain one-off and non-trading items that, by their nature, can be classified as exceptional items. Historically, exceptional items have included items such as acquisition and integration costs, impairment charges and other one-off, non-recurring items and fair value re-measurements of financial instruments. No exceptional items were recognised for the 2017 financial year, but exceptional costs of £4 million were incurred in delivering on our productivity agenda in the 2018 financial year and exceptional costs of £73 million were incurred in delivering on our productivity agenda and in connection with the Acquisition in the 2019 financial year. Exceptional items, if any, are set out in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the relevant period. For additional details in respect of exceptional items in the 2018 and 2019 financial years, see note 2.2 of the audited consolidated financial statements of the 2018 and 2019 financial years, each as included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Underlying EBITDA for (i) the 2019 financial year and, where presented on a restated basis, the 2018 financial year gives effect to IFRS 16 and the exclusion from our results of discontinued operations and (ii) for the 2017 financial year and, where presented on an as originally reported basis, the 2018 financial year is presented on an IAS 17 basis and includes in our results the impact of discontinued operations. Underlying EBITDA and exceptional items may not be directly comparable with other similarly titled measures or profit measures used by other companies. Normalised EBITDA for the 2017, 2018 and 2019 financial years gives effect to certain adjustments made in connection with share-based payments (non-cash costs) and Tooley Street Exit Incentive (each as described under ‘‘Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data—Other Operating, _Financial and Pro Forma Financial Information’’), in each case, to Underlying EBITDA. In addition,_ Normalised EBITDA for (i) the 2019 financial year and, where presented on a restated basis, the 2018 financial year also gives effect to the exclusion from EBITDA of the impact of applying IFRS 16 and the exclusion from our results of the results of discontinued operations, (ii) for the 2018 financial year, where presented on an as originally reported basis, is presented on an IAS 17 basis and also gives effect to the exclusion from our results of the results of discontinued operations and (iii) for the 2017 financial year is presented on an IAS 17 basis and includes in our results the impact of discontinued operations. Normalised EBITDA may not be directly comparable with other similarly titled measures or profit measures used by other companies. _Pro forma EBITDA, as used in this Offering Memorandum, represents Normalised EBITDA adjusted to_ give effect to certain adjustments, including public company cost-savings in connection with the de-listing of MEL Shares from the London Stock Exchange and certain FX adjustments. The estimated cost-savings and adjustments, which have been used to calculate our pro forma EBITDA for the 2019 financial year, are xx ----- based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the information available to the Consortium and management’s judgments based on such information. Assumptions used in estimating cost-savings are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic, and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Pro forma EBITDA for the 2019 financial year also gives effect to the exclusion from EBITDA of the impact of applying IFRS 16 and the exclusion from our results of the results of discontinued operations. The figure shown for our _pro forma EBITDA for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019 has not been, and cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by an independent accounting firm and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. Pro forma EBITDA may not be directly comparable with other similarly titled measures or profit measures used by other companies. EBITDA per segment, as used in this Offering Memorandum, represents segment profit before exceptional items, finance income and costs, taxation, depreciation and amortisation and is after taking account of profit after tax of joint ventures. Certain costs are not allocated to individual operating groups and are therefore not included within EBITDA per segment. Our segments are the Midway Attractions, LEGOLAND Parks and Resort Theme Parks (together, the ‘‘Attractions’’). EBITDA per segment for (i) the 2019 financial year and, where presented on a restated basis, the 2018 financial year gives effect to IFRS 16 and the exclusion from our results of discontinued operations and (ii) for the 2017 financial year and, where presented on an as originally reported basis, the 2018 financial year is presented on an IAS 17 basis and includes in our results the impact of discontinued operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

These measures are presented in this Offering Memorandum because they are measures our management uses to assess operating performance, and we believe that they and similar measures are widely used in our industry as a means of evaluating a company’s operating performance and financing structure, and because we believe they present helpful comparisons of financial performance between periods by excluding the distorting effect of certain non-recurring items. These measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and are not measurements under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting principles. Our Non-IFRS Metrics have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results or any performance measures under IFRS as set forth in our financial statements. Some of these limitations are: - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital commitments or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay; - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated income statement; - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; xix ----- - assets are depreciated or amortised over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, Non-IFRS Metrics should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with IFRS. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS results and using these Non-IFRS Metrics only as supplements to evaluate our performance.

As at 28 December 2019, we operated 130 Attractions in 25 countries across four continents, and in the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019, we welcomed approximately 67 million visitors to our Attractions. We are the largest operator of visitor attractions and theme parks in Europe and the second largest operator globally, in each case, by number of visitors in 2018. We are also a market leader in the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy by total visitor numbers, with an already significant and growing presence in the United States and the Asia-Pacific region. We believe we own and/or operate a unique portfolio of chainable iconic assets and brands, each possessing a strong heritage within its original markets, as well as being globally scalable and supported by our extensive technical and creative expertise. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments globally (including within the markets in which we operate) have implemented strict social distancing measures, including varying degrees of lockdowns and closures of non-essential businesses, including ours. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented disruption to our business, and the wide variations in potential outcomes present a material challenge to our business and our industry. We took action early in response to the crisis as COVID-19 was emerging in Asia and we continue to take every step that we believe is prudent to protect and manage the business, reduce our cost base and protect our operating cash flows. See ‘‘—Recent Developments—Impact of _Coronavirus (COVID-19).’’ As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, it is not possible to accurately_ predict the medium- or long-term impact of COVID-19 on our business and our industry. Since our establishment in 1999, our strategic vision continues to be the creation of a high growth, high return, family entertainment business, naturally balanced against the pressures of the macroeconomic environment in which we operate. Our portfolio of assets and brands is highly diversified across geography, attraction type, brand and customer demographic and our globally diversified portfolio is well-balanced between indoor and outdoor Attractions and international and domestic visitation (with international and domestic visitation measured relative to the relevant Attraction). We believe our footprint across 25 countries provides us with a favourable platform to benefit from the normalised global growth trend in spending on travel and tourism, by allowing us to attract both international tourists and domestic visitors, and providing us with a buffer in the event of macroeconomic and currency risks. Our operating groups offer our visitors diverse entertainment options, including both indoor Attractions within city centres as well as outdoor theme parks offering multi-day visits. We estimate that in 2018, 72 per cent. of visitors to our Attractions were domestic visitors and 28 per cent. were international tourists, based on a survey of a sample of our visitors. In the 2019 financial year, 39 per cent. of our revenue was derived from our LEGOLAND Parks and 22 per cent. of our revenue was derived from our Resort Theme Parks operations, which are primarily organised around outdoor activities, and 39 per cent. of our revenue was derived from our Midway Attractions operating group, which is primarily organised around indoor activities, providing a natural hedge against weather disruptions. We have established a diverse portfolio of nationally and internationally recognised premium brands focused on delivering memorable experiences to millions of visitors around the world. We generated revenue of £1,740 million, Underlying EBITDA from continuing operations of £569 million, profit before tax of £133 million and underlying profit before tax of £234 million for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019. We generated Normalised EBITDA of £484 million and pro forma EBITDA of £492 million, in each case for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019 and disapplying IFRS 16 and excluding from our results of the results of discontinued operations.

See ‘‘Presentation of Financial Information—Non-IFRS Financial Information.’’ Our three operating groups are supported by our extensive in-house business development, creative, project management and production group, Merlin Magic Making, which employs people across Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific region. Merlin Magic Making is responsible for driving innovation across our group and creating high-class, compelling propositions for our Attractions (‘‘Creating the _Magic’’), developing new concepts into commercially-viable attractions (‘‘Developing the Magic’’),_ producing compelling content such as wax figures and Attraction theming (‘‘Producing the Magic’’) and constructing new Attractions and investment projects, including new hotels and rides (‘‘Delivering the _Magic’’)._ 2 22APR202007322083 ----- Merlin Magic Making is central to our major projects. In 2018, Merlin Magic Making worked to develop two new brands, the Bear Grylls Adventure in Birmingham and the first three of our Peppa Pig-themed Attractions, including our ‘‘in park’’ Peppa Pig Lands at Gardaland Resort and Heide-Park Resort and our first Peppa Pig World of Play Attraction in Shanghai. We believe these Attractions continue to broaden our appeal in different markets and geographies, and reflect the increasing volume and strength of our relationships with third-party intellectual property holders who seek to leverage their content through location-based entertainment. We also worked on the launch of a further five Midway Attractions across three continents. In 2019, Merlin Magic Making launched the Magic Hotel at Gardaland Resort, a new Dungeon at Alton Towers Resort and a new Peppa Pig World of Play in Texas and Michigan, LEGOLAND Discovery Centres in Shenyang, Beijing and San Antonio and SEA LIFE Centres in Shenyang and Malaysia and re-launched the Colossos roller coaster at Heide-Park Resort. Merlin Magic Making is also working on a number of Attractions, including our development of the LEGOLAND Waterpark at Gardaland Resort and the Pirate Island Hotel in LEGOLAND Florida, which would be the first LEGO Pirate hotel in North America. Our strategy and performance is underpinned by our commitment to operational excellence and is driven by an integrated approach to quality management, capital investment, marketing and pricing, together with a focus on health and safety. Our strong financial returns are also the result of our efficient and strategic deployment of capital expenditure across the Existing Estate and new Attractions. We have demonstrated the strength of our diversified business model through our historical financial track record. The drivers of this performance are: - investment in our Existing Estate to improve customer satisfaction, increase capacity and provide compelling new propositions to guests in order to drive organic growth through visitations and pricing power; - rolling out new Midway Attractions under our chainable global brands to drive organic revenue growth, often with a ‘‘cluster’’ focus to drive commercial advantages and with a focus on new sites outside of Europe, including in emerging markets to continue our geographic diversification; - developing new LEGOLAND Parks, including the opening of LEGOLAND Dubai in 2016 and LEGOLAND Japan in 2017, the targeted openings of LEGOLAND New York in 2021, LEGOLAND Korea by 2022, LEGOLAND Sichuan by the end of 2023 and LEGOLAND Shanghai after 2023 and potentially other new LEGOLAND Parks in China and the rest of the world, subject to targeted return on investment criteria; and - transforming our Theme Parks into destination resorts by adding a broad range of themed accommodation and new Attractions at our Theme Parks to improve customer satisfaction and drive multi-day visitation, such as the opening of a 142-room Castle Hotel at LEGOLAND Billund Resort, a 128-room Magic Hotel at Gardaland Resort and 102 ‘‘stargazing pods’’ at Alton Towers Resort in 2019 as well as the targeted openings of a LEGOLAND Waterpark at Gardaland Resort and a Pirate Island Hotel in LEGOLAND Florida.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604
187,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Competitive Strengths,9.4.1,Unique Portfolio of Strong Brands and Iconic Assets,"We believe we own and/or operate a unique global portfolio of chainable brands and iconic assets which are widely recognised by consumers and have a strong heritage. Examples include Madame Tussauds, SEA LIFE and the London Eye in our Midway Attractions operating group, LEGOLAND California and LEGOLAND Windsor in our LEGOLAND Parks operating group and Gardaland Resort and Alton Towers Resort in our Resort Theme Parks operating group. We believe the strength and breadth of our iconic brand portfolio enable us to offer compelling entertainment propositions through a wide variety of activities and visitor experiences across a broad range of geographies and all key target demographic groups ranging from families with young children, teenagers, young adults to older adults. Our LEGOLAND Parks also benefit from a mutually synergistic relationship with the LEGO Group. Our portfolio is focused on delivering high-quality family entertainment, with the LEGOLAND Parks and LEGOLAND Discovery Centres in particular placing an emphasis on ‘‘playful learning.’’ Our portfolio of brands enables us to differentiate our Parks and Attractions from unbranded operators and to attract visitors to our Attractions. 3 ----- _Midway Attractions_ Our Midway Attractions benefit from high-quality, chainable brands with broad international appeal and recognition, which are distributed across geographies, markets and target demographics, creating a diversified portfolio. We believe the strength of our brands allows us to maximise economies of scale and synergies. As at 28 December 2019, our Midway Attractions included: - Madame Tussauds, the world’s premier wax figures exhibition for over 200 years, where visitors are encouraged to interact with historical and celebrity figures in both more mature and emerging markets, comprising 23 Attractions in twelve countries; - The Eye brand and observation Attractions with iconic, and internationally recognised landmarks such as the lastminute.com London Eye and the Sydney Tower Eye; - SEA LIFE, the world’s largest aquarium brand, comprising 46 Attractions in 19 countries, with strong name recognition and a track record of providing high-quality and informative family entertainment for over 30 years and campaigning actively on a variety of conservation issues prioritised around breeding, rescue and protection of the marine environment; - The Dungeons, with a strong ‘‘cult’’ reputation amongst the teen and young adult market for a unique mix of dark, historical horror and irreverent humour, delivered through set piece shows performed by live actors, rides and themed sets, comprising eleven Attractions in five countries, including the Shanghai Dungeon which opened in 2018 and the Alton Towers Dungeon, which opened in 2019; and - LEGOLAND Discovery Centres, an extension of the LEGOLAND brand to the Midway Attractions format, offering the same values of interactivity and family fun in a smaller, more accessible format, comprising 23 Attractions in eight countries, including LEGOLAND Discovery Centres in each of Beijing, San Antonio and Shenyang, which opened in 2019. In 2018, we opened seven new Midway Attractions, which included Little BIG City Beijing, our second Attraction under that format, the first Dungeon Attraction in Asia in Shanghai, and pilots of two new intellectual property partnerships, The Bear Grylls Adventure in the U.K. and Peppa Pig World of Play in Shanghai. In 2019, we opened eight new Midway Attractions, which comprised the Alton Towers Dungeon, LEGOLAND Discovery Centres in each of Beijing, San Antonio and Shenyang, SEA LIFE Attractions in Malaysia and Shenyang and Peppa Pig World of Play in Dallas and Michigan. Other Attractions include two Treetop Walk experiences in Victoria and New South Wales, Australia, which we acquired as part of the Living and Leisure Australia acquisition in February 2012, one WILD LIFE Australian animal adventure Attractions in Sydney, ‘‘DreamWorks Tours’ Shrek’s Adventure!’’ Midway Attraction in London and two ‘‘Little BIG City’’ Midway Attractions in Berlin and Beijing. Our scale and portfolio of strong brands has allowed us to leverage a number of strategic synergies. We have developed ‘‘clusters’’ of Midway Attractions in Amsterdam, Arizona, Bangkok, Berlin, Blackpool, Dallas, Istanbul, Kansas City, London, Manchester, Melbourne, Michigan, Oberhausen, Orlando, San Francisco, Shanghai, Sydney and Tokyo, where multiple Attractions are situated in one city or region to capitalise on strong cross promotional and operational synergies, including multi-attraction tickets to drive cross-selling. _LEGOLAND Resorts and Parks_ The LEGO brand is globally recognised and is associated with fun and learning through play. We hold the global, exclusive license to own and operate LEGOLAND Parks until at least 2054. We own and/or operate LEGOLAND Parks in Denmark, Germany, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, Dubai, California, Florida and Japan, all of which build on the strength of the LEGO brand and are themed and interactive parks, which are designed to appeal to families (particularly with children aged two to twelve years) looking for a fun and engaging day out. We have expanded our LEGOLAND offering in recent years with the opening of LEGOLAND Florida in 2011, LEGOLAND Malaysia in 2012, LEGOLAND Dubai in the United Arab Emirates in 2016 and LEGOLAND Japan in 2017. We operate the parks in Malaysia and Dubai under management contracts. LEGOLAND Japan is ‘‘leased and operated,’’ meaning a third-party partner (a subsidiary of KIRKBI) funded the acquisition of the park site, the development of the infrastructure and the basic construction while we funded and built the rides, provided the necessary theming and built the on-site SEA LIFE Centre second gate and the on-site accommodation. We lease the site on a long-term basis and operate the 4 ----- park. In 2017, we announced the development of a LEGOLAND park in New York State with a targeted opening in 2020, which is being developed under an ‘‘owned and operated’’ model. We are now targeting a 2021 opening. At the start of 2019, we also announced that an agreement had been reached with Gangwon Provincial Government with respect of partial funding for LEGOLAND Korea, which will be an owned and operated resort, targeted to open by 2022. We intend to invest approximately £190 million in LEGOLAND Korea, of which funding of approximately £135 million will be provided by us and approximately £55 million will come from LL Developments, the investment arm of Gangwon Province. Of this £55 million, approximately £14 million was received by 29 June 2019 and the balance was received in July 2019. This site is also being developed under an ‘‘owned and operated’’ model. We have also identified sites for potential LEGOLAND Parks in the medium and long-term and maintain ongoing dialogue with a number of potential partners to develop several LEGOLAND parks in China with a focus on operating these parks under management contracts. In September 2019, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to partner in the development of LEGOLAND Sichuan and operate it under a management contract arrangement, with the resort scheduled to open by the end of 2023. In addition, in November 2019, we entered into an agreement with the Shanghai Jinshan District Government, CMC Inc. and KIRKBI to develop a LEGOLAND resort in the Jinshan District of Shanghai to open after 2023. All of our open LEGOLAND Parks, with the exception of LEGOLAND Dubai where we anticipate opening a hotel, have themed on-site hotels ranging from 61 to 263 rooms. During the 2019 financial year, we opened 372 rooms, including a 142-room Castle Hotel at LEGOLAND Billund Resort. We opened 644 new rooms in 2018, including a 252-room hotel at LEGOLAND Japan, transforming the park, which opened in 2017, into a resort. Adding on-site, themed accommodation has historically improved guest satisfaction, increased the catchment area for our parks, increased the level of pre-booked revenue and improved cross-selling opportunities. For example, we opened 142-rooms at the Pirate Island Hotel at LEGOLAND Deutschland in 2018, during which year we had a guest satisfaction score of 97 per cent. and occupancy of up to 95 per cent. We also have plans for additional accommodation at our other parks in future years. We believe these hotels and villages provide an integral contribution to the overall customer experience and help drive increases in multi-day ticket sales. _Resort Theme Parks_ Each of our six Resort Theme Parks is a national brand aimed at families, teenagers and young adults, with themed accommodation at all locations. For example, THORPE PARK Resort focuses especially on the teen and young adult markets whereas Chessington World of Adventures Resort is orientated more towards families. Each of our Resort Theme Parks, certain of which are among the leading theme parks in the U.K., Italy and Northern Germany, enjoys high brand and customer awareness in its local market. We believe that each of our Resort Theme Parks offers a compelling, coherent proposition and strong theming, with few or no local competitors that can offer the same quality or scale of visitor experience. We aim to implement effective marketing and promotions to ensure that each brand is the strongest in its relevant market. Our Resort Theme Parks are recognised as destination resorts, attracting short break visits from national and, in certain cases, international visitors, supported by short break marketing campaigns. Each of our Resort Theme Parks has one or more hotels or holiday villages. We opened a 76-room CBeebies Land Hotel and 102 ‘‘stargazing pods’’ at Alton Towers Resort in 2017 and 2019, respectively. In 2019, we also opened a Magic Hotel at Gardaland Resort and announced the intended opening of a LEGOLAND Waterpark at Gardaland Resort. Each of our Resort Theme Parks is strongly positioned in its national/regional market, often representing the pre-eminent visitor attraction in its respective region and benefiting from being situated in a prominent location with good transport links to areas of substantial populations. In particular, we have a market leading position in the United Kingdom, where we own the top four theme parks, as classified by the Themed Entertainment Association, by number of visitors in 2018: LEGOLAND Windsor (part of our LEGOLAND Parks operating group), Alton Towers Resort, THORPE PARK Resort and Chessington World of Adventures Resort. We also hold strong market positions in Italy and Germany, in each case by number of visitors in 2019. The scale of our Resort Theme Parks and available undeveloped land at certain locations has also provided opportunities for ‘‘second gates,’’ which are visitor attractions at an existing resort with a separate entrance and for which additional admission fees are charged. For example, there is a SEA LIFE centre located close to Gardaland Resort and a Dungeons Warwick Castle on the Warwick Castle site. 5 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,604
187,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Competitive Strengths,9.4.2,Attractive Market Trends,"Notwithstanding the current challenges from the current COVID-19 situation, we believe the global leisure market possesses a number of attractive features that facilitate growth over the long-term. The main factors underpinning sector trends are the increasing leisure time in both developed and emerging economies, the value placed on time spent together with friends and family and growing tourism to gateway cities. According to the World Travel & Tourism Council (the ‘‘WTTC’’) in a publication released prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, spending in the global leisure market was forecast to increase by 3.9 per cent. per annum from $4.65 trillion to $6.78 trillion between 2019 and 2029, respectively, which reflects faster growth than that of the broader economy. In 2018, international tourist arrivals totalled 1.4 billion, representing the second strongest year since 2010. Tourist arrivals grew by 6 per cent. in 2018, which was the ninth consecutive year of sustained growth, according to the UN World Tourism Organisation (the ‘‘UNWTO’’). Despite certain external events (including geopolitical incidents and acts of terrorism), the international travel industry has grown consistently over this period. According to the UNWTO, international tourism has grown at a CAGR of 3.8 per cent. from 2007 to 2017. It is not at this time possible to predict what long-term impact, if any, the COVID-19 pandemic will have on these trends. Significant growth in international tourism has historically had a positive impact on certain of our Attractions, including those in London, New York, Shanghai, Tokyo and Hong Kong, which have also benefitted from a growing trend of short break holidays by domestic travellers to key getaway cities. Short breaks in the U.K. have grown at a CAGR of 5.0 per cent. from 2.8 million holiday breaks in 1996 to 7.4 million in 2016 resulting in an increasing number of people taking ‘‘staycations.’’ Furthermore, the relatively lower cost of short breaks or ‘‘staycations’’ has historically provided a buffer when we are faced with more challenging economic conditions as individuals forego destination holidays in favour of entertainment closer to home. Subject to the impact of the disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe we are well-positioned to meet this demand for short-term accommodation through our growing offering of themed, on-site accommodation and second gate Attractions aimed at extending the duration of our visitors’ stay. In the 2019 financial year, accommodation revenue represented 22 per cent. of revenue across our theme park operating groups compared to 13 per cent. in 2013. Accommodation not only continues to increase the duration of our visitors’ stay, allowing greater cross-selling opportunities and driving improved levels of guest satisfaction, but also leads to increases in pre-bookings, revenue visibility and positive working capital.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604
187,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Competitive Strengths,9.4.3,Intellectual Property Partnerships,"Given our global reach and multi format expertise, we believe we are well-placed to benefit from the growing opportunities to partner with leading owners of intellectual property content. These partnerships provide us with additional means to deliver memorable experiences to visitors of our Attractions and we offer our partners opportunities to increase engagement with their customers. For example, we have multiple intellectual property agreements ranging in scale from local level relationships for specific Attractions, to global, multi-product relationships with some exclusivity, to our core global, multi-product and exclusive relationship with the LEGO Group. We hold the global, exclusive rights to the LEGOLAND brand under the licencing and co-operation agreement signed with KIRKBI A/S. We have a synergistic relationship with the LEGO Group and KIRKBI A/S, which is a 75 per cent. shareholder of the LEGO Group with a 100 per cent. ownership of the LEGO and LEGOLAND trademarks and a 50 per cent. shareholder of our Group. We have also established and continue to develop, global, regional and local intellectual property partnerships allowing us to use brands such as Ghostbusters, the Gruffalo, Shrek, Kung Fu Panda and CBeebies, the latter through our partnership with BBC Worldwide. We continue to develop new global intellectual property partnerships and in 2018, we opened a Bear Grylls Adventure Attraction in the United Kingdom and a Peppa Pig Attraction in China. Our standalone, intellectual property-led Attractions therefore include LEGOLAND Parks and Discovery Centres, Peppa Pig World of Play, The Bear Grylls Adventure and ‘‘DreamWorks Tours’ Shrek’s Adventure!’’",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

Each of our operating groups commands a strong market share within its market and benefits from competitive advantages. Our ongoing product investment and innovation, and strong focus on creating memorable experiences for our guests, have resulted in continued strong levels of guest satisfaction. In 2019, we delivered an overall guest satisfaction score across our group of 94 per cent. and a ‘‘Net Promoter’’ score of 56 per cent., which measures the propensity for our guests to recommend 6 ----- our Attractions and which increased compared to 2017. We consider a Net Promoter score of 50 per cent. or more to be ‘‘world class.’’ Our ‘‘Net Promoter’’ score was 47, 50, 53, 55, 55 and 57 for the 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 financial years, respectively. We believe that the strong market position and breadth of the operations of our Resort Theme Parks, LEGOLAND Parks and Midway Attractions are also supported by our historic investment in each category. In particular, our existing portfolio of strong brands and use of the LEGO brand offer a compelling proposition that distinguishes our business. In each of our three operating groups, we benefit from in-house technical and creative capacity, well-located sites in attractive markets, permits and branding relationships. We also retain a number of competitive advantages in the Midway Attractions operating group. These advantages include strong brand recognition in connection with our existing brands such as Madame Tussauds, SEA LIFE, the Eye and LEGOLAND/LEGO, our own in-house Merlin Magic Making team which includes wax sculptors, our SEA LIFE marine biologists and our ability to operate our Midway Attractions as part of ‘‘clusters,’’ where multiple Attractions are situated in one city or region to capitalise on cross-selling, including through our multi-attraction pass opportunities. We have been able to capitalise on our marketing leverage through ticketing promotions with partners such as Kellogg’s and Tesco, amongst others. A popular package amongst customers is the sale of annual passes, which are purchased online or at our parks for a one-off price that enables customers to visit all Attractions within a particular country for one year for no additional admission fee. In addition, our scale also allows us to capitalise on operating cost-efficiencies, including marketing costs, central management, site development expertise and application of visitor management experiences across our portfolio.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604
187,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Competitive Strengths,9.4.5,Well-Diversified Portfolio,"Through our broad portfolio of Attractions, our overall business is diversified across geography, attraction type, brand and customer demographic. This diversification helps us deliver strong financial results across a variety of different market conditions and to minimise the impact of external factors, such as regional economic performance, extreme weather and other external factors. We operate in 25 countries globally, including 15 countries in Europe and North America and ten countries in the Asia-Pacific region, drawing both domestic and international visitors in each location. In the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019, the United Kingdom, Europe (excluding the United Kingdom), North America and the Asia-Pacific region accounted for 32 per cent., 25 per cent., 27 per cent. and 16 per cent. of our revenue, respectively. These results reflect increased diversification of revenue sources since the 2011 financial year, during which the United Kingdom and Europe (excluding the United Kingdom) accounted for 43 per cent. and 34 per cent. of reported revenues, respectively, while North America accounted for only 16 per cent. of reported revenues and the Asia-Pacific region accounted for only 7 per cent. of reported revenues. Our long-term ambition is for a relatively equal split of revenue across Europe (including the United Kingdom), North America and the Asia-Pacific region. Our business is not reliant upon the ‘‘fly-in’’ market of international tourism. We estimate that in 2018, 72 per cent. of visitors to our Attractions were domestic visitors and 28 per cent. were international tourists, based on a survey of a sample of our visitors. Domestic visitors enhance the resilience of the underlying business as relatively low-cost local tourism is preferred in a soft macroeconomic environment. Our Attractions range in format from city centre to destination resorts and coastal Attractions, capturing both the urban and resort-based tourist market and appealing to visitors ranging from families with young children to teenagers and adults. Our Attractions are also partially insulated against extreme weather or seasonal changes through a mixture of formats, with 39 per cent. of our revenue having been derived from our LEGOLAND Parks and 22 per cent. of our revenue having been derived from our Resort Theme Parks operations, both of which are primarily organised around outdoor activities, and 39 per cent. of our revenue having been derived from our Midway Attractions operating group, which is primarily organised around indoor activities, in the 2019 financial year. Most of our Attractions are open year-round, other than our European Theme Parks, which tend to be closed during the winter. In 2018, 62 per cent. of our revenue (excluding the impact of IFRS 15) came from sites that are open all year-round. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had been experiencing increasing pre-booked revenues, leading to reduced volatility in Attraction revenues. In the 2018 financial year, 62 per cent. of total admissions revenue (excluding the impact of IFRS 15) were generated from pre-bookings or annual passes, also 7 ----- resulting in a positive financial contribution to working capital.

See ‘‘Presentation of Financial Information—Non-IFRS Financial _Information.’’ Further, our own in-house Merlin Magic Making team delivers innovative new product ideas_ including ride concept and design, wax figure manufacture, animal and fish husbandry, and therefore yields synergies and cost-savings over third-parties that would otherwise be engaged to develop our Attractions. We also maximise our marketing spend through targeted campaigns focused on educating prospective customers about new Attractions and rides. Throughout this process, we take advantage of our market leverage and implement cost-efficiencies such as shared marketing costs, central management, site development expertise and application of visitor management experiences across the portfolio. In addition to the benefits we derive from our core competencies, we maintain our estate through regular planned maintenance capital expenditure, which means that incremental capital expenditure can be targeted at driving incremental revenue opportunities. LEGOLAND Parks typically require lower capital expenditure than our Resort Theme Parks because they are geared towards families with young children and do not require expensive, large format roller coasters. Our Resort Theme Parks tend to be nationally pre-eminent in their respective markets and therefore lack the significant competitive intensity of the theme park operators in the United States. As a result, we do not need to compete solely on the basis of the latest and largest coasters but can open significant new coasters on an opportunistic basis. In addition, although not directly comparable to other theme park operators, the Midway Attractions operating group does not require substantial ongoing capital expenditure due to the lack of large scale coasters, or rides, and the low overall degree of capital employed in each site. Capital expenditure programmes for the Midway Attractions operating group vary between Attractions, depending on the size and anticipated growth of the Attraction. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion _and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital Expenditure.’’_ Capital expenditure across our portfolio of Attractions is primarily funded out of our operating free cash flow. Our total reported capital expenditure for the 2019 financial year was £379 million, of which £40 million was used for the development of new accommodations, £41 million was used for the development of Midway Attractions, £135 million was used for the longer term development of new LEGOLAND parks, specifically LEGOLAND New York and LEGOLAND Korea, and £163 million was used for our Existing Estate. Our Existing Estate capital expenditure was 10 per cent., 9 per cent. and 9 per cent. of revenue in the 2017, 2018 and 2019 financial years, respectively. Our successful and flexible capital expenditure programme has translated into consistently positive cash conversion with cash conversion of 66.5 per cent., 74.6 per cent. and 71.5 per cent. in the 2017, 2018 and 2019 financial years, respectively. 22APR202017591988 Source: Company information.

187,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Competitive Strengths,9.4.8,Highly Experienced and Diverse Management Team Backed by Equity Owners with In-depth Knowledge of the Company,"Our senior management team is highly experienced within both the attractions industry and our businesses, with decades of combined sector experience, supplemented with relevant experience from outside the attractions industry. See ‘‘Management.’’ Our Chief Executive Officer, Nick Varney, has led Merlin since our inception in 1999. The senior management team has driven the development and execution of our strategy to deliver growth both organically and through acquisitions. Our senior management team is supported by local management teams, which run our operating groups and Attractions. Each Resort Theme Park, LEGOLAND Park and regional or functional division of the Midway Attractions operating group has a divisional director, who is supported by a management team and who reports directly to the relevant operating group managing director. This decentralised management structure empowers site management to make commercial and operational decisions locally, enabling real-time reaction to local market conditions. Our senior management team is also supported by the Merlin Magic Making team, which is our unique, creative and project management resource. Merlin Magic Making also provides creative design and production. Our strong local management teams are often a result of our culture of training and development, with central and local programmes to develop skills at all levels of the organisation. The commitment of our employees is best demonstrated by the results of the 2019 annual staff survey. Our employee engagement score is one of Merlin’s Key Performance Indicators, measuring whether our teams think we are a ‘‘great place to perform,’’ ‘‘a great place for customers’’ and a ‘‘great place to work.’’ In 2019, our engagement score was 87 per cent., which is above the global average for this type of survey. Our senior management team is supported by Blackstone and KIRKBI, with whom we have meaningful and successful history. Blackstone had previously been our majority shareholder since a management backed buy-out investment in 2005. At the same time, we acquired rights to LEGOLAND Parks from KIRKBI A/S, who signed the licensing and co-operation agreement with us, and KIRKBI became one of our shareholders. See ‘‘Business—History—Our Relationship with the KIRKBI Group.’’ Blackstone and KIRKBI continued to jointly control Merlin for eight years from 2005 to 2013, during which period we successfully grew, with a revenue CAGR of 12.5 per cent. from 2008 to 2013, to become the second largest visitor attraction business globally in terms of number of annual visitors. Our senior management team has a strong relationship with Blackstone and KIRKBI, with our current CEO, Nick Varney, having worked closely with Blackstone and KIRKBI during their previous ownership tenure. Blackstone has longstanding experience investing in the visitor attractions industry as well as the broader hospitality, travel and leisure sectors. Blackstone’s previous investments include Merlin Entertainments, SeaWorld, Six Flags, Universal Orlando, Center Parcs, Hilton Hotels and The Cosmopolitan Hotel. In addition, the Consortium has a long history of joint ownership of companies they acquired together, with Blackstone and KIRKBI having acquired Armacell in 2015 and Blackstone and CPP Investments having acquired, among other companies, Refinitiv in 2018 and Ascend in 2017.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604
187,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Our Strategy,9.5.1,Existing Estate Growth via the Application of Prudent Investment Practices,"We continue to invest in our existing Attractions to improve the visitor experience, which we believe is a key driver for increased visitor numbers and revenue growth. To improve our product appeal, maintain our high levels of customer satisfaction and drive organic growth, we have developed prudent investment practices. Investments are planned well in advance, where possible, according to the forecasted potential returns and the capital requirements of the respective Attraction, operating groups and location. Existing Estate capital expenditure is divided between adding new rides or displays and enhancements to our Attractions, replacing old features with newer, more compelling ones and general maintenance, including ensuring health and safety standards are met or exceeded. Our capital expenditure practices are designed 10 ----- to develop the product portfolio over time so as to increase visitor numbers and visitors’ length of stay and to support value-added increases in admissions fee prices and commercial spend, thereby delivering growth in revenue and profitability. In addition to major rides and developments, we also make smaller investments at most Attractions to support a continually refreshed marketing message and sustained level of visitor satisfaction. For example, we have developed touring displays of wax work figures which can be rotated around our Madame Tussauds Attractions. We intend to continue maintaining the existing standards of general maintenance and commitments to ensure health and safety standards and making strategic, value-accretive investments in our Existing Estate and in respect of New Business Development to maintain and strengthen our leading positions in the industry in which we operate.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604
187,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Our Strategy,9.5.2,Leveraging Strategic Synergies,"We aim to leverage our scale in key markets to maximise our operational, marketing, product and cost synergies. Strategic initiatives we have taken include: _The Merlin Annual Pass and Merlin Pass Monthly Membership_ We offer customers a pass that enables them to visit all Attractions within a particular country for one year for an up-front fee (the ‘‘Merlin Annual Pass’’). Merlin Annual Passes are available in the United Kingdom, Germany, the United States and Australia. In the United Kingdom, we also allow customers to pay a monthly fee on a minimum twelve-month contract as part of a Merlin Pass Monthly Membership in order to enjoy entry to over 30 of our Attractions in the United Kingdom. Merlin Pass Monthly Memberships are offered at two price points to offer customers either standard or premium amenities. The membership pass accounts for approximately 30 per cent. of all online U.K.-wide pass sales. The key benefits of the Merlin Annual Pass and Merlin Pass Monthly Membership include: driving customer loyalty and brand-awareness, increasing revenue visibility and securing cash flows in advance, and potentially increasing the level of commercial spend. _Accesso Ticketing_ The roll-out of the accesso ‘‘Passport’’ ticketing system across our estate is largely complete. Previously, customers had to purchase tickets for our various Attractions separately using a fragmented ticketing system. Accesso helps standardise ticketing across our estate, giving us greater opportunities to up-sell and cross-sell tickets, which we believe will be of particular benefit for cluster Attractions. Accesso provides for benefits in mobile sales and ticketing, Merlin Annual Pass management and queue-busting ticket sales. There is a particular focus on online sales and bookings to improve the customer ‘‘digital journey.’’ Online pre-bookings help provide a short-term hedge against the impact of poor weather. They also offer opportunities to cross-sell commercial spend items, such as overnight accommodation and priority ride passes. _Group Promotions and Marketing_ We apply flexible pricing and promotional strategy to manage visitor numbers through peaks and troughs of attendance, to extend the length of stay and to encourage repeat visits and to enhance overall revenue from each Attraction. Such pricing strategies include promotional discounts, such as selling admission through a retailer’s loyalty card programme, and wider national marketing campaigns, such as one part of a newspaper advertising promotions and ‘‘on pack’’ promotions of major consumer brands. We have conducted successful national promotions in the United Kingdom, including promotions with Tesco, McDonalds and Kellogg’s, as well as abroad. We use these methods to strategically drive demand for the Attractions at times when visitor numbers are typically lower, to drive commercial spend and to achieve ‘‘low-cost’’ advertising to build Attraction and brand-awareness. Online channels provide opportunities for more targeted promotions with lower lead times in the future. _Procurement Synergies_ Our scale allows us to exploit procurement cost-efficiencies within a country or region and across clusters and we seek to achieve benefits from such savings as we increase our global scale. 11 ----- _Productivity Agenda_ We have successfully mitigated cost pressures in recent years, resulting from legislative changes, such as the U.K. national living wage, and significant increases in utility and business rates. We are also increasingly seeing the impact of tighter labour markets in many parts of the world, such as Southern California, Southern Germany and the South East of England. To date, our ability to mitigate costs has been achieved largely through Attraction-level savings and tactical efficiency improvements. Our global productivity agenda gathered pace in 2018, aimed at streamlining and evolving our back office and operations to provide long-term sustainable savings. For example, we are developing our new cloud based finance system, the roll-out of which we commenced in the fourth quarter of the 2019 financial year across our North American Midway estate, to stimulate better use of technology and the centralisation and standardisation of activities. As a part of ‘‘model evolution,’’ we have launched initiatives seeking to simplify and streamline the operations of our smaller Midway Attractions and applied lean continuous improvement principles across our Theme Parks. We have also exited certain non-core smaller Midway Attractions. As this programme accelerates, we expect to incur total one-off costs of approximately £35 million from 2018 through 2021, of which £11 million has been incurred as at 28 December 2019. As at December 28 2019, we expect that these initiatives will generate up to £35 million of sustainable, annualised savings by 2022, including back office costs savings and operational savings. We expect to generate these savings through a number of initiatives, including the centralization of activities into shared service hubs, the automation of processes, dynamic pricing tools and organisational syndication. In addition, we believe there may be opportunities for cost-savings beyond what was initially anticipated. For example, we expect to generate an additional £2 million of annual savings as a result of our de-listing from the London Stock Exchange. In addition to delivering financial savings, our agenda seeks to improve productivity, better enabling our Attraction staff and general managers to focus on delivering memorable experiences for our guests.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604
187,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Our Strategy,9.5.3,Transformation of Theme Parks to Destination Resorts,"We seek to position our Theme Parks as destination resorts through the addition of a broad range of themed accommodation. We expect our enhanced Theme Parks will benefit from the short break tourism market and complement the business generated by our day visit market. As at 28 December 2019, we had a total of 4,490 rooms across our Theme Parks. These include themed on-site accommodation at all of our open LEGOLAND Parks, with the exception of LEGOLAND Dubai, where we intend to open a hotel, ranging from 61 to 263 rooms. LEGOLAND Deutschland, LEGOLAND Billund and LEGOLAND Florida each include a holiday village, ranging from 166 to 319 rooms. LEGOLAND Billund opened a 142-room Castle Hotel in 2019. We also intend to open a Pirate Island Hotel in LEGOLAND Florida. Alton Towers Resort has three hotels, including the 76-room CBeebies Land Hotel, which opened in 2017 and 102 ‘‘stargazing pods,’’ which opened in 2019. Gardaland Resort has three hotels, including the Magic Hotel, which opened in 2019, Chessington World of Adventures Resort has two hotels and THORPE PARK Resort and Heide-Park Resort each has one hotel. In addition, Warwick Castle has a 65-room ‘‘Knight’s Village’’ and Heide-Park Resort has a 165-room holiday camp. We believe these hotels and holiday villages provide an integral contribution to the overall customer experience, help drive pre-booking, increase multi-day ticket sales and improve guest satisfaction. We believe that this destination positioning has already extended visitor market reach to over five hours drive time and has enhanced revenues from both primary admissions, including multi-day tickets and second gate admission fees, and commercial spend. The latter is typically comprised of the sale of food and beverages, merchandise and souvenirs as a result of longer average lengths of stay. We have continued our strategy of investing in second gate and up-sell Attractions, where appropriate, to lengthen overall visitor times and enhance revenues. In 2018 and 2019, we opened three second gate Attractions at our Theme Parks in the United Kingdom and Asia. In 2019, we announced the targeted opening of a LEGOLAND Waterpark as a second gate at Gardaland Resort, in addition to Gardaland Resort’s existing second gate, SEA LIFE Aquarium. In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have been reviewing and re-phasing capital projects, where possible, to protect and manage the business, reduce our cost base and protect our operating cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604
187,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Our Strategy,9.5.4,LEGOLAND Park Developments,"We have a proven track record of developing and operating LEGOLAND Parks globally. We opened new LEGOLAND Parks in Florida in 2011, in Malaysia in 2012, in Dubai in 2016 and in Nagoya, Japan in 2017. 12 ----- LEGOLAND Malaysia and LEGOLAND Dubai are operated under management contracts and we intend for LEGOLAND Sichuan to adopt a similar structure. LEGOLAND Japan is operated under our ‘‘leased _and operated’’ model. In October 2017, we announced the development of LEGOLAND New York in_ Goshen, Orange County, 60 miles north-west of New York City, initially with a targeted opening of 2020 and, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, now with a targeted opening in 2021. In 2018, we announced our intention to open a LEGOLAND Park in South Korea by 2022 and we have further development plans in China with a focus on operating these parks under management contracts. For example, in September 2019, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to partner in the development of LEGOLAND Sichuan and operate it under a management contract arrangement, with the resort scheduled to open by the end of 2023. In addition, in November 2019, we entered into an agreement with the Shanghai Jinshan District Government, CMC Inc. and KIRKBI to develop a LEGOLAND resort in the Jinshan District of Shanghai to open after 2023. Under the terms of the agreement, all parties will form a joint venture company and contribute funding to the construction and development of LEGOLAND Shanghai. Given the strength of the LEGO and LEGOLAND brands and the success of our existing LEGOLAND Parks, we see significant scope for new LEGOLAND Parks, particularly in Asia, and we are committed to ensuring that future expansion is carefully planned and executed in order to maintain core brand values. We have three operating and investment models with respect to the development of LEGOLAND Parks. Firstly, in more proven locations, we follow an ‘‘owned and operated’’ model. Under this approach, we make the necessary capital investment to secure the land and develop the infrastructure ourselves. We have used this model in our European and North American LEGOLAND Parks and LEGOLAND New York and LEGOLAND Korea are being developed under this model. Second, in new and unproven locations, we use a low capital commitment model, whereby the capital investment is provided by a third-party and we operate the park pursuant to a management agreement arrangement and are-paid annual operating fees. We operate LEGOLAND Malaysia under this model. We do not own the park but instead operate it pursuant to a development and management contract with our partners. The Malaysian government provided the funds to develop LEGOLAND Malaysia. We own a 20 per cent. interest in the company that owns LEGOLAND Malaysia. LEGOLAND Dubai is operated under a similar management contract model, whereby LL Dubai Theme Park LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of DXB Entertainments, owns the assets and we operate the park. We do not have an equity interest in LEGOLAND Dubai. We intend for LEGOLAND Sichuan to adopt a similar structure. See ‘‘Business—Material Contracts.’’ Third, we can operate parks under a ‘‘leased and operated’’ model. Under this approach, the acquisition of the park site, the development of the infrastructure and the basic construction is funded by a third-party partner. We fund and build the rides and the necessary theming, lease the site on a long-term basis, and operate the LEGOLAND Park. LEGOLAND Japan, for example, was developed using this approach with a subsidiary of KIRKBI as the lessor.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604
187,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Our Strategy,9.5.5,Strategic Acquisitions,"We continue to consider acquisitions of, or investments in, visitor attractions, sites and brands that could strategically enhance our portfolio and enable us to grow into new geographies. We have demonstrated a track record of identifying, implementing and integrating both large and small acquisitions and delivering significant value uplift through improving the acquired operations. Examples of this strategy include the original acquisition of LEGOLAND Billund, LEGOLAND California, LEGOLAND Deutschland and LEGOLAND Windsor as well as the acquisitions of Gardaland, the Tussauds Group, the Sydney Attractions Group and Living and Leisure Australia. In 2016, we acquired a minority interest in BIG BUS Tours and entered into co-promotion agreements with them in certain city centre locations. We have not made any acquisitions since 2017, as we continue to assess opportunities where potential targets can complement our organic growth plans and meet our strict investment return criteria. We believe that there remain further attractive acquisition opportunities that would meet our investment criteria in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604
187,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.6,Recent Developments,9.6.1,Impact of Coronavirus (COVID-19),"In the last three months, the global COVID-19 pandemic has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world, resulting in governments in affected areas taking unprecedented steps to put restrictions on 13 ----- international, national and local travel and social gatherings, in each case leading to business slowdowns and shutdowns. The spread of COVID-19 has had a material negative impact on our business, resulting in the current temporary closure of substantially all of our Attractions. At the foundation of all business decisions we are making in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is the health, safety, and well-being of our employees and visitors around the globe. As such, we have followed government advice or, in some cases, gone beyond those requirements to ensure our response to the pandemic is socially responsible. We took action early in response to the crisis as COVID-19 was emerging in Asia by closing our Attractions in China in late January 2020, and we continue to take every step that we believe is prudent to protect and manage the business, reduce our cost base and protect our liquidity. Merlin has 130 Attractions in four continents. Out of this total, all but nine of our Attractions remain closed as at 21 April 2020, including all Attractions in the United Kingdom, the rest of Europe and North America and most of our Attractions in the Asia-Pacific region. Since the global COVID-19 crisis began, we have adopted swift measures to significantly reduce cash outflows in the form of operating cost and cash control measures, with the aim of maximising our liquidity position. Specifically, we have adopted the following measures: - furloughed approximately 80 per cent. of staff globally and implemented a freeze on hiring seasonal staff; - implemented voluntary salary reductions; - marketing and advertisement spend has been cut to near zero in the current period; and - significantly reduced variable costs including variable staffing and variable rent. These actions have resulted in an approximately 45 per cent. reduction of operating expenses against our budget. In addition, we have: - actively engaged to access government benefits, including in relation to the costs of furloughed staff in qualifying jurisdictions (approximately £10 million per month at current levels), and on U.K. business rates recovery (approximately £2 million per month); - implemented a programme to extend customers’ annual and season passes, and to enable customers with advanced bookings to easily re-book; - reduced our planned capital expenditure programme by 40 per cent. (excluding LEGOLAND New York and LEGOLAND Korea, as detailed below). This has resulted in a reduced scope of work that is focused on concluding current projects, essential maintenance and infrastructure work in our existing estate portfolio; and - actively engaged with our landlords to seek deferrals and/or rent-free periods whilst our Attractions, and the developments that they are within are closed. As a result of the cost-cutting and cash-savings measures outlined above, and under a scenario where our Attractions remain largely closed but in a state of readiness to reopen during 2020, we estimate that our net average operational cash outflow (including non-deferred rent) will be approximately £50 million per month after interest, mandated debt amortisation, tax and capital expenditure on our Existing Estate. This is broken down as follows: - operating cost outflow including rent net of deferrals averaging approximately £30 million per month assuming all our Attractions are closed; - capital expenditure on the Existing Estate portfolio averaging approximately £6 million per month; - debt service payments averaging approximately £12 million per month; and - cash tax averaging approximately £1 million per month. In addition to the above, we continue to monitor the situation with regards to our current and planned investments in New Business Development, such as LEGOLAND New York and LEGOLAND Korea. As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, we have decided to delay the opening of LEGOLAND New York to 2021, enabling us to conserve liquidity in the near term. There is no site work currently ongoing for LEGOLAND New York. However, we estimate the total spend required to finish the project is approximately £150 million, out of a total budget of approximately £340 million. LEGOLAND Korea is planned to open in 2022. Out of the total budget of approximately £190 million, we estimate the total 14 ----- spend required to finish the project is approximately £160 million. As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have approximately £24 million remaining of the local government grants received in connection with the funding of LEGOLAND Korea, which we intend to utilise on the next phase of the project spend. With respect to these two major projects and other investments in New Business Development, we expect to manage our commitments prudently to ensure we maintain adequate operational liquidity. _Liquidity Update_ As at 28 March 2020, MAL and its consolidated subsidiaries had a cash position of £520 million, which, pro _forma for the Offering, would have been £865 million. An additional £30 million committed under the_ Revolving Credit Facility is available to be drawn by way of establishing certain ancillary facilities, including letters of credit that are typically utilised from time to time in the ordinary course of business.

Accordingly, figures for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019 reflect the application of IFRS 16 and the exclusion of the impact in our results of discontinued operations, as reported in the audited consolidated financial statements of Merlin and its subsidiaries for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019. In order to facilitate a comparison of our results of operations for the 2018 and 2019 financial years, we present a restatement of the audited consolidated income statement of Merlin and its subsidiaries as at and for the 52 weeks ended 29 December 2018 to give effect to the application of IFRS 16 and to separately present the results from discontinued operations from those from continuing operations, as described in, and extracted from, the audited consolidated financial statements of Merlin and its subsidiaries as at and for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019. (2) EBITDA is defined as profit before finance income and costs, taxation, depreciation and amortisation and is after taking account of profit after tax of joint ventures. Underlying EBITDA reflects adjustments to EBITDA to exclude the impact of certain one-off and non-trading items that, by their nature, can be classified as exceptional items. No exceptional items were recognised for the 2017 financial year, but exceptional costs of £4 million were incurred in delivering on our productivity agenda in the 2018 financial year and exceptional costs of £73 million were incurred in delivering on our productivity agenda and in connection with the Acquisition in the 2019 financial year. Normalised EBITDA for the 2017, 2018 and 2019 financial years gives effect to certain adjustments made in connection with share-based payments (non-cash costs) and Tooley Street Exit Incentive (each as described below), in each case, to Underlying EBITDA. In addition, Normalised EBITDA for (i) the 2019 financial year and, where presented on a restated basis, the 2018 financial year also gives effect to the exclusion from EBITDA of the impact of applying IFRS 16 and the exclusion from our results of the results of discontinued operations, (ii) for the 2018 financial year, where presented on an as originally reported basis, is presented on an IAS 17 basis and also gives effect to the exclusion from our results of the results of discontinued operations and (iii) for the 2017 financial year is presented on an IAS 17 basis and also includes in our results the impact of discontinued operations. Pro forma EBITDA represents Normalised EBITDA adjusted to give effect to certain adjustments, including public company cost-savings in connection with the de-listing of MEL Shares from the London Stock Exchange and certain FX adjustments. These adjustments are based upon various assumptions, forecasts and management estimates and are in part based upon historical information. This information does not represent the results we would have achieved had each of the adjustments occurred and been fully implemented on the first day of the relevant financial period. In addition, our estimates of the impact of 30 ----- the cost-savings are based upon forecasts and management estimates and are presented on an annual run rate basis as if such cost-savings had been fully realised at the beginning of the relevant period. We may not be able to achieve these cost-savings in a timely manner or at all. The estimated cost-savings and adjustments, which have been used to calculate our _pro forma EBITDA for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019, are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the information available to us and the management’s judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in estimating cost-savings are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic, and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our estimates of cost-savings. These numbers have not been, and cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by an independent accounting firm. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not be comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this Offering Memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. EBITDA, Underlying EBITDA, Normalised EBITDA and _pro forma EBITDA are included in this Offering Memorandum because we believe they are helpful to investors as measures of our operating performance and ability to service our debt. These measures are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. Other companies, including those in our industry, may calculate similarly titled financial measures differently from us, and so the presentation of such financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial Information.’’ Funds depicted by certain of these measures may not be available for management’s discretionary use due to covenant restrictions, debt service payments or other commitments. The following table provides a reconciliation of profit for the year to EBITDA, EBITDA to Underlying EBITDA and Underlying EBITDA to Normalised EBITDA to pro forma EBITDA for the periods indicated:",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

(b) Exceptional items in the 2018 financial year represent one-time costs of £4 million incurred in connection with implementing our productivity agenda, which we initiated during the 52 weeks ended 29 December 2018 to streamline and evolve our back office and operations to provide long-term sustainable savings. Exceptional items in the 2019 financial year represent one-time costs of (i) £23 million of share-based payment and bonus costs that were either accelerated or otherwise specifically incurred in connection with the Acquisition, (ii) £43 million of professional advisor fees incurred by the Group in connection with the Acquisition and (iii) £7 million of consulting costs and staff termination expenses in connection with implementing our productivity agenda, which we expect to continue through to 2021. For a summary of our productivity agenda, see ‘‘Summary—Our Strategy—Leveraging Strategic Synergies—Productivity Agenda.’’ (c) Sales tax rebate represents the non-recurring sales tax rebates received in the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 relating to sales tax refunds for SEA LIFE Attractions in Europe. (d) Share-based payments (non-cash costs) represent non-cash stock-based compensation expenses incurred by Merlin as a result of being a listed company during the historical periods presented and are based upon the reported financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS and the remuneration structures in place as at the time of those financial statements. Share-based payments exclude amounts already adjusted as exceptional items in the audited consolidated financial statements of Merlin and its subsidiaries. 31 ----- (e) Tooley Street Exit Incentive represents the reversal of the yearly non-cash recognition of the payment received in February 2013 from the landlord of Merlin’s previous London Dungeon Attraction to exit the lease at Tooley Street. This payment is being recognised in income over a ten-year period given the obligations Merlin has for this period in connection with the operation of the new site at County Hall. (f) Lease accounting adjustments represent adjustments made to exclude the impact of the application of IFRS 16 from EBITDA and Underlying EBITDA as reported in our audited consolidated financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019 to facilitate the calculations of Normalised EBITDA and pro forma EBITDA. (g) Disposal of Australian ski resorts represents the removal of discontinued operations from our financial results. On 21 February 2019, we entered into an agreement to sell our Australian ski resorts at Mount Hotham and Falls Creek to Vail Resorts Inc. We completed the sale on 5 April 2019 for total cash-consideration of A$174 million. These Attractions formed part of the Midway Attractions operating group. In 2018, reported revenue and underlying EBITDA for the two sites, were £35 million and £11 million, respectively. (h) Public company cost savings for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019 represent identified cost savings in connection with salaries to Non-Executive Directors, department costs and Group-wide finance reporting obligations. (i) FX adjustment represents the currency adjustment based on the 30-day average FX rates through 15 April 2020, which adds back the FX impact to the EBITDA for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019 as if the 30-day trailing average exchange rates were used during the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019. (3) EBITDA margin is defined as EBITDA divided by total revenue. (4) Operating free cash flow conversion represents Operating free cash flow divided by Underlying EBITDA. (5) _Pro forma cash and cash equivalents represent cash and cash equivalents of MAL and its subsidiaries as at 28 December 2019, as adjusted to give effect to the Offering and the full cash drawings under the Revolving Facility and the Delayed Draw Term Loan, as if the Offering occurred on 28 December 2019. MAL and its subsidiaries had cash and cash equivalents of £176 million as at 28 December 2019 and £520 million as at 28 March 2020 (of which approximately £24 million was granted by the local government towards the funding of LEGOLAND Korea and is expected to be used for such purpose), which amount as at 28 March 2020 included cash drawings under the Revolving Facility and the Delayed Draw Term Loan. Giving effect to the Offering, MAL and its consolidated subsidiaries would have had cash and cash equivalents of £865 million as at 28 March 2020, of which approximately £24 million would have been granted by the local government towards the funding of LEGOLAND Korea.

Although the Existing 2026 Indenture, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement contain, and the Indenture will contain, restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the amount of debt that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Sale and leaseback transactions as well as lease obligations, including those that were classified as finance leases in Merlin’s financial statements prior to the implementation of IFRS 16, are not considered debt under the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture and the Indenture.

See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.’’ Various interest rate benchmarks (including LIBOR and EURIBOR) are the subject of recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some reforms are already effective, including the EU Benchmark Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011), while others are still to be implemented. In addition, the sustainability of LIBOR has been questioned by the FCA as a result of the absence of relevant active underlying markets and possible disincentives (including possibly as a result of regulatory reforms) for market participants to continue contributing to such benchmarks. On 29 November 2017, the Bank of England and the FCA announced that the market working group on Sterling Risk-Free Rates would have an extended mandate to catalyse a broad transition to the Sterling Over Night Index Average rate (‘‘SONIA’’) across sterling bond, loan and derivatives markets so that SONIA is established as the primary sterling interest rate benchmark by the end of 2021. The Bank of England and FCA have stated that a key near-term priority for the working group will be to continue making recommendations relating to the potential development of term SONIA reference rates. These reforms and other pressures may cause other benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Based on the foregoing, investors should in particular be aware that: - any of these reforms or pressures described above or any other changes to a relevant interest rate benchmark (including LIBOR or EURIBOR) could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause it to be lower and/or more volatile than it would otherwise be; and - if LIBOR or EURIBOR is discontinued, then the rate of interest applicable to our sources of funding may be determined for a period by applicable fall-back provisions, although such provisions, often being dependent in part upon the provision by reference banks of offered quotations for the LIBOR or EURIBOR rate, may not operate as intended (depending on market circumstances and the availability of information on applicable rates at the relevant time) and may in certain circumstances result in the effective application of a fixed rate based on the rate which applied in the previous period when LIBOR or EURIBOR was available. More generally, any of the above matters or any other significant change to the setting or existence of LIBOR or EURIBOR could affect the ability of amounts available to us to meet our obligations under our sources of funding and/or could have a material adverse effect on the value or liquidity of, and the amount payable under, our sources of funding.

The Indenture will also permit Collateral to secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will only enforce the Collateral as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and the Indenture regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action.

There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a security document are validly secured.

The Guarantors are organised under the laws of Denmark, England and Wales, Germany, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Italy and the United States. The insolvency laws of these jurisdictions may not be as favourable to your interests as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. Although laws differ amongst these jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and, in the case of the Guarantees and the Collateral, limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in-courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Guarantee against a Guarantor. The court may also in certain circumstances void the Guarantee or the Collateral where a Guarantor or security provider is close to or in the vicinity of insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or security providers or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Guarantees or Collateral, and intercompany obligations generally, as fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - void or invalidate or declare ineffective all or a portion of a Guarantor’s or security provider’s obligations under its Guarantee or Collateral; - direct that holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee or Collateral to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to you. If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Guarantee is found to be a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or an improper transfer of assets or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor and security provider under its Guarantee and the Collateral will be limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee or Collateral not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability. Also, there is a possibility that the entire Guarantee or Collateral may be set aside, in which case, the entire liability may be extinguished. 59 ----- In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent or improper transfer or other applicable principles, courts may need to make findings that, at the time the Guarantees or Collateral were issued, a Guarantor or security provider: - issued such Guarantee or Collateral with the intent or knowledge of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its insolvency; - was aware of the fact that some creditors were disadvantaged over other creditors by these actions; - issued such Guarantee or Collateral in a situation where a prudent businessman as a shareholder of such Guarantor would have contributed no equity to such Guarantor or security provider; or - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Guarantee or Collateral on the basis that the Guarantee or Collateral was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or some other basis and (1) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issue of the Guarantee, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons, (2) was engaged, or about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were unreasonably small or (3) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due. However, less-stringent requirements may be provided under the laws of certain jurisdictions. Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantee or granted Collateral if: - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute. In addition, the laws, regulations, declarations or other governmental measures introduced in response to COVID-19 may have the effect of imposing a moratorium on or otherwise delaying or limiting the ability to enforce or pursue certain remedies in respect of the Guarantees and Collateral. Although we believe that we are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, there can be no assurance which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or security provider was ‘‘insolvent’’ as of the date the Guarantees were issued and the Collateral was granted or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued, or Collateral was granted, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any other of our subsidiaries experience financial difficulty, it may not be possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

Security interests to secure the Notes and the Guarantees will be granted in Collateral located in certain of these jurisdictions. Your rights under the Notes and the guarantees will therefore be subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in the jurisdictions mentioned above, in the jurisdiction of incorporation or organisation of a 60 ----- future guarantor, or in other jurisdictions. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Your rights under the Notes, the security granted in respect of the Notes and the Guarantees will be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. In addition, insolvency and administrative laws are subject to change and your rights may be impacted by any such legal reforms. In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative, examinership and other laws of the Issuer’s and the non-U.S. Guarantors’ jurisdictions of organisation may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other and those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict amongst them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and collect payment in full under the Notes and the Guarantees in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive. See ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the _Guarantees and Security’’ and ‘‘Enforcement of Civil Liabilities’’ with respect to some of the jurisdictions_ mentioned above. Moreover, in certain jurisdictions, it is unclear whether all security interests in the Collateral gives the Security Agent a right to prevent other creditors from foreclosing on and realizing the Collateral or whether certain security interests only give the Security Agent and the holders of the Notes priority (according to their rank) in the distribution of any proceeds of such realization. Accordingly, the Security Agent and the holders of the Notes may not be able to avoid foreclosure by other creditors (including unsecured creditors) on the Collateral. In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will serve as a common security agent for the secured parties under the Intercreditor Agreement (collectively, the ‘‘Secured Parties’’). The Security Agent will act with respect to the Collateral only at the direction of the relevant Instructing Group (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and in accordance with the enforcement principles set out in the Intercreditor Agreement. As such, all recoveries shall be turned-over to the Security Agent and applied to the liabilities in respect of the Senior Facilities prior to the Notes.

Although the Issuer and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors. In addition, as substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors, their subsidiaries and their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them judgments obtained in U.S. courts.

In addition, the Consortium has control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of shareholders regardless of whether our management believes that any such transactions are in our own best interests. For example, the shareholders could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness, to sell 61 ----- certain material assets or make dividends, in each case, so long as the Existing 2026 Indenture, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture, the Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement so permit.

In addition, for compliance with certain restrictive covenants, we will depend upon the cooperation of our principal shareholders who have the power to effect compliance with such covenants. The interests of the Consortium and its affiliates could conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. The Consortium may also have an interest in pursuing divestitures, financings or other transactions that in their judgment could enhance their equity investments, although such transactions might involve risks to holders of the Notes. The Consortium or members thereof may sell shares in JVco or otherwise syndicate or transfer their ownership interests without being required to contribute proceeds therefrom to MAL or its subsidiaries, and such transactions may, although significant, not constitute a change of control under the terms of the Notes. In addition, the Consortium or its affiliates may, in the future, own businesses that directly compete with ours or do business with us. The Consortium may also pursue via different portfolio companies acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.

In such a situation, the Issuer may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Notes that are tendered under any such offer. If a significant principal amount of Notes is tendered, the Issuer will likely have to obtain financing to pay for the tendered Notes. However, the Issuer may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A change of control may also result in a mandatory prepayment under the Senior Facilities Agreement and agreements governing any future indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of such indebtedness. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event, as defined in the Indenture, would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement. In addition, the change of control provisions under the Indenture will be different to the change of control provisions under the Existing 2026 Notes Indenture, wherein a change of control repurchase event is triggered by certain ratings events. The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganisations, restructurings, mergers, recapitalizations or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event.

As at 28 December 2019, we operated 130 Attractions in 25 countries across four continents, and in the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019, we welcomed approximately 67 million visitors to our Attractions. We are the largest operator of visitor attractions and theme parks in Europe and the second largest operator globally, in each case, by number of visitors in 2018. We are also a market leader in the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy by total visitor numbers, with an already significant and growing presence in the United States and the Asia-Pacific region. We believe we own and/or operate a unique portfolio of chainable iconic assets and brands, each possessing a strong heritage within its original markets, as well as being globally scalable and supported by our extensive technical and creative expertise. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments globally (including within the markets in which we operate) have implemented strict social distancing measures, including varying degrees of lockdowns and closures of non-essential businesses, including ours. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented disruption to our business, and the wide variations in potential outcomes present a material challenge to our business and our industry. We took action early in response to the crisis as COVID-19 was emerging in Asia and we continue to take every step that we believe is prudent to protect and manage the business, reduce our cost base and protect our operating cash flows. See ‘‘—Recent Developments—Impact of 73 ----- _Coronavirus (COVID-19).’’ As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, it is not possible to accurately_ predict the medium- or long-term impact of COVID-19 on our business and our industry. Since our establishment in 1999, our strategic vision continues to be the creation of a high growth, high return, family entertainment business, naturally balanced against the pressures of the macroeconomic environment in which we operate. Our portfolio of assets and brands is highly diversified across geography, attraction type, brand and customer demographic and our globally diversified portfolio is well-balanced between indoor and outdoor Attractions and international and domestic visitation (with international and domestic visitation measured relative to the relevant Attraction). We believe our footprint across 25 countries provides us with a favourable platform to benefit from the normalised global growth trend in spending on travel and tourism, by allowing us to attract both international tourists and domestic visitors, and providing us with a buffer in the event of macroeconomic and currency risks. Our operating groups offer our visitors diverse entertainment options, including both indoor Attractions within city centres as well as outdoor theme parks offering multi-day visits. We estimate that in 2018, 72 per cent. of visitors to our Attractions were domestic visitors and 28 per cent. were international tourists, based on a survey of a sample of our visitors. In the 2019 financial year, 39 per cent. of our revenue was derived from our LEGOLAND Parks and 22 per cent. of our revenue was derived from our Resort Theme Parks operations, which are primarily organised around outdoor activities, and 39 per cent. of our revenue was derived from our Midway Attractions operating group, which is primarily organised around indoor activities, providing a natural hedge against weather disruptions. We have established a diverse portfolio of nationally and internationally recognised premium brands focused on delivering memorable experiences to millions of visitors around the world. We generated revenue of £1,740 million, Underlying EBITDA from continuing operations of £569 million, profit before tax of £133 million and underlying profit before tax of £234 million for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019. We generated Normalised EBITDA of £484 million and pro forma EBITDA of £492 million, in each case for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019 and disapplying IFRS 16 and excluding from our results of the results of discontinued operations.

187,Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Factors Affecting our Results of Operations,17.4.1,Admissions,"Visitor attendance levels are the primary driver of our revenue and one of the primary drivers of our profitability. From 2012 to 2018, visitor attendance grew by a CAGR of 3.6 per cent. and from 2018 to 2019, visitor attendance grew by 1.0 per cent. Most of our revenue is generated by visitors through admission fees and commercial spend such as on food and beverages and retail opportunities. For the 2019 financial year, visitor revenue, accommodation revenue and other revenue constituted 82 per cent., 14 per cent. and 4 per cent. of our total revenue, respectively. Visitor attendance has historically been primarily driven by, and dependent upon, the appeal of our Attractions, and we believe that the sustainability of visitor attendance at the Attractions is contingent upon maintaining high visitor satisfaction levels. We measure visitor satisfaction through monitoring guest feedback on a daily basis by both local and central monitoring teams. This process assists management in pricing and directing capital investment and resources to improve our product offering, including through updating and refreshing the Attractions on a regular basis. We target an overall satisfaction level of over 90 per cent. at each of the Attractions, and most of our Attractions consistently achieve scores above 90 per cent. Our average guest satisfaction score across our group in 2019 was 94 per cent. We also monitor the 76 ----- propensity for our guests to recommend our Attractions, having received a ‘‘Net Promoter’’ score of 56 per cent. in the 2019 financial year. We consider a Net Promoter score of 50 per cent. or more to be ‘‘world _class.’’ Our ‘‘Net Promoter’’ score was 47, 50, 53, 55, 55 and 57 for the 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018_ financial years, respectively. Visitor attendance is also impacted by our pricing and marketing strategies. The effectiveness of these strategies is dependent upon their alignment with the appropriate target audience, which requires management to implement and deliver brand clarity in respect of each Attraction’s proposition. Visitor attendance is also influenced by economic conditions, conditions of the tourism industry and external factors beyond our control. The factors affecting growth in visitor attendance may vary amongst our operating groups. We believe the evolution in visitor attendance during the periods under review for the Midway Attractions operating group has been driven largely by the impact of terror attacks, particularly in London (for example, the temporary shutdown of the London Eye following the Westminster Bridge attack in London in 2017), partially offset by the roll-out of new Attractions. We believe the growth in overall visitor attendance at our LEGOLAND Parks operating group has been driven by a combination of capital expenditure on the Existing Estate, new accommodation facilities and the development of new Attractions underpinned by the strength of the LEGO brand. In the 2019 financial year, such growth was offset by limited momentum from ‘‘The LEGO Movie 2.’’ Visitor attendance at the Resort Theme Parks operating group increased slightly during the period under review due to the continuing roll-out of accommodation and new product development, offset partly by the impact of terror attacks and unfavourable weather in continental Europe. The breadth and scale of our portfolio help limit the impact of external events, including terrorist attacks and severe weather patterns, in a specific jurisdiction and operating group.

Maintaining the appeal of our Attractions requires prudent capital investment in both our Existing Estate as well as in connection with New Business Development. In the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019, we have spent £379 million in total capital expenditure of which £163 million related to Existing Estate capital expenditure. See ‘‘—Capital Expenditure.’’ _Existing Estate_ Part of our growth strategy is to make targeted investments to update and refresh our Existing Estate on a regular basis. We seek to achieve this through both operating and capital expenditures that are intended to improve product appeal and guest experience, which are key to increasing visitor attendance levels and length of stay. Such investments include (i) adding new rides and Attractions and improving food and beverage facilities and retail offerings, (ii) replacing old features with new, more up to date features and (iii) general maintenance of existing Attractions, including ensuring health and safety standards are met or exceeded. Such investment supports increases in admission fees and commercial spend and helps drive our revenue growth and profitability. For example, accommodation not only continues to increase the duration of our visitors’ stay, allowing greater cross-selling opportunities and driving improved levels of guest satisfaction, but also leads to increases in pre-bookings, revenue visibility and positive working capital. We also make capital investments to improve back office and IT efficiency. The percentage of revenue invested in Existing Estate capital expenditure varies by operating group. Midway Attractions require relatively lower capital expenditure due to the smaller scale of the Attractions and the higher proportion of first time tourist visitors while Resort Theme Parks, and to a lesser extent LEGOLAND Parks, which target a younger age-range than Resort Theme Parks, require relatively higher capital expenditure due to the development of new rides and Attractions of significant scale and the drive to attract repeat visitors. We establish targeted returns for all capital expenditure incurred in respect of projects expected to make a positive contribution to EBITDA, and we build these targeted returns into our annual budgets. While it is not possible to accurately ascertain returns for individual investments, we believe that the launch of new features at the Attractions following capital investments are a key contributing factor in increasing visitor attendance numbers, particularly during the year of launch. In the 2019 financial year, our significant capital investments in the Resort Theme Parks and LEGOLAND Parks operating groups included the re-launch of the iconic ‘‘Colossos’’ roller coaster at Heide-Park Resort and the first of our LEGO Movie World investments in LEGOLAND Florida. In the Midway Attractions operating group, we made significant capital investments in SEA LIFE Sydney Aquarium, where visitors can now experience the world’s largest Great Barrier Reef exhibit in the interactive ‘‘Day and Night on the _Reef.’’_ In the 2018 financial year, our significant capital investments in the Resort Theme Parks operating group were the ‘‘Wicker Man’’ roller coaster in Alton Towers Resort, which drove growth in visitation and revenue per capita, and Peppa Pig Lands at Heide-Park Resort and Gardaland Resort, which proved similarly successful, supporting significant growth in the young family and pre-school markets. Conversely, we did not make significant capital investments with respect to the Midway Attractions operating group or with respect to the LEGOLAND Parks, although we have invested longer term in developing new LEGOLAND parks, specifically LEGOLAND New York and LEGOLAND Korea. In the 2017 financial year, our significant capital investments in the Resort Theme Parks and LEGOLAND Parks operating groups were the development of a NINJAGO World in each of LEGOLAND Windsor, 78 ----- Germany and Florida and a Gruffalo River Adventure ride at Chessington World of Adventures Resort. In the Midway Attractions operating group, our significant capital investments included ‘‘Ocean Invaders’’ at SEA LIFE London Aquarium. During the 2017, 2018 and 2019 financial years, we invested an average of 9.3 per cent. of our total revenue each financial year in capital expenditure relating to the development of our Existing Estate. Our Existing Estate capital expenditure was 10 per cent., 9 per cent. and 9 per cent. of revenue in the 2017, 2018 and 2019 financial years, respectively. During the periods under review, we have funded our Existing Estate capital expenditure from our operating free cash flow and we expect to continue to do so going forward. The table below presents the evolution of our Existing Estate capital expenditure and Existing Estate capital expenditure as a percentage of EBITDA for the 2008 through 2019 financial years: 22APR202017591988 Source: Company information. (1) Cash conversion is defined as Underlying EBITDA minus Existing Estate capital expenditure as a percentage of Underlying EBITDA. (2) Underlying EBITDA reflects adjustments to EBITDA to exclude the impact of certain one-off and non-trading items that, by their nature, can be classified as exceptional items. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial Information—Non-IFRS Financial _Information.’’ No exceptional items were recognised for the 2017 financial year, but exceptional costs of £4 million were_ incurred in delivering on our productivity agenda in the 2018 financial year and exceptional costs of £73 million were incurred in delivering on our productivity agenda and in connection with the Acquisition in the 2019 financial year. Exceptional items, if any, are set out in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the relevant period. (3) Underlying EBITDA and revenue presented reflect the application of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16, and excludes the results of discontinued operations. In respect of the Midway Attractions, we aim to consistently update and refresh our entertainment offerings through the rotation of themed exhibitions across the SEA LIFE Centres; the annual addition of new wax figures at each Madame Tussauds Attraction; the addition of a new ride, feature or new 4-D film at each LEGOLAND Discovery Centre approximately once every five years; and the regular introduction of new story lines at The Dungeons sites. Additionally, we expect to periodically undertake a refurbishment of the capsules of the London Eye, which takes three to four years to complete, in order to update and improve the visitor experience. The last capsule refurbishment was completed between the 2008 and 2012 financial years at a cost of approximately £13 million in aggregate. Historically, capital investments were managed in cycles, determined based on periodic low, medium and high levels of investment, for each individual Attraction across our business. We benefit from an ability to defer capital expenditure, which when combined with an efficient net working capital profile and increased cash flow visibility from pre-bookings and our accommodation strategy, supports sustainable cash flow conversion. We intend to continue maintaining the existing standards of general maintenance and commitments to ensure health and safety standards and making strategic, value-accretive investments in our Existing Estate. 79 22APR202017591988 ----- In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, we have reduced our planned capital expenditure programme by 40 per cent. (excluding expenditure on LEGOLAND New York and LEGOLAND Korea), which has resulted in a reduced scope of work that is focused on concluding current projects, essential maintenance and infrastructure work in our Existing Estate portfolio. As a result of the cost-cutting and cash-savings measures we have taken, and under a scenario where our Attractions remain largely closed but in a state of readiness to reopen during 2020, we estimate that our capital expenditure on the Existing Estate portfolio will average approximately £6 million per month. _New Business Development_ We also focus on a New Business Development programme to drive strategic growth. This programme includes, amongst others, adding visitor attractions that are located next to Theme Parks and for which additional admission fees are charged, referred to as ‘‘second gates,’’ and improving and expanding accommodation facilities and opening new LEGOLAND Parks and Midway Attractions. In the 2019 financial year, our New Business Development capital expenditure was £216 million, which increased from £183 million in 2018. Spend on New Business Development in the 2019 financial year included £40 million related to developing new accommodation across the existing theme park estate opening in 2019 or 2020, £41 million related to new Midway Attractions that either opened in 2019 or for a 2020 opening and £135 million related to the longer term investments of developing new LEGOLAND parks, specifically LEGOLAND New York and LEGOLAND Korea. We initially targeted an opening in 2020 for LEGOLAND New York and, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are now targeting an opening in 2021. This is a complex project and we now expect to spend approximately £340 million, of which approximately £190 million had been spent as at 28 March 2020. At the start of 2019, we also announced that an agreement had been reached with Gangwon Provincial Government with respect of partial funding for LEGOLAND Korea, which will be an owned and operated resort, targeted to open by 2022. We intend to invest approximately £190 million in LEGOLAND Korea, of which funding of approximately £135 million will be provided by us and approximately £55 million will come from LL Developments, the investment arm of Gangwon Province. Of this £55 million, approximately £14 million was received by 29 June 2019 and the balance was received in July 2019. Additionally, the funding for necessary additional infrastructure adjacent to LEGOLAND Korea will be provided by national, regional and local governments. The Korean Government Gangwon Province and Chuncheon City have already invested in the construction of the new bridge to Hajungdo Island where LEGOLAND Korea will be located and undertaken groundworks on the site. Out of the total budget of approximately £190 million, we estimate the total spend required to finish the project is approximately £160 million. As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have approximately £24 million remaining of the local government grants received in connection with the funding of LEGOLAND Korea, which we intend to utilise on the next phase of the project spend. Furthermore, in September 2019, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to partner in the development of LEGOLAND Sichuan and operate it under a management contract arrangement, with the resort scheduled to open by the end of 2023. In addition, in November 2019, we entered into an agreement with the Shanghai Jinshan District Government, CMC Inc. and KIRKBI to develop a LEGOLAND resort in the Jinshan District of Shanghai to open after 2023. Under the terms of the agreement, all parties will form a joint venture company and contribute funding to the construction and development of LEGOLAND Shanghai.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

During the 2018 financial year, we delivered pilot openings of new intellectual property based Attraction formats, Peppa Pig World of Play and The Bear Grylls Adventure, which are aimed at the pre-school and adventure seeker markets, respectively. Visitor attendance at the LEGOLAND Parks increased during this time with the expansion of the LEGOLAND Japan Resort by adding a hotel and SEA LIFE Centre to the park, which had opened in 2017, with themed accommodation expansion in other parks also driving organic growth. Visitor attendance for the Resort Theme Parks increased due to the growing attraction of the major resorts at Alton Towers Resort and Gardaland Resort, reflecting ongoing product investment and favourable weather. Visitor attendance at the Midway Attractions operating group increased by 1.1 per cent. from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to stronger inbound tourism in London as it recovered from the terrorist attacks of 2017, offset in part by the removal of the beluga whales from Chang Feng Ocean World in Shanghai as well as the downward trend in trading in Hong Kong, especially towards the end of the year, reflecting the ongoing civil unrest in that location. Visitor attendance at the LEGOLAND Parks increased by 0.5 per cent. during this time due in part to poor weather and difficult trading conditions in a number of our markets, partially offset by a strong Easter and Spring Break performance of our LEGOLAND Parks. Visitor attendance for the Resort Theme Parks increased by 1.2 per cent. due in part to favourable Easter weather in the UK, successful product launches such as the ‘‘Colossos’’ ride at Heide Park and ‘‘Room on the Broom’’ at Chessington World of Adventures Resort, as well as good summer trading.

Unless otherwise specified, 77 ----- visitor numbers include visitors to Attractions operated under management contracts (which, during the periods under review, included LEGOLAND Malaysia, LEGOLAND Dubai and (until we exited the management contract in May 2018) the Orlando Eye), in respect of which we earn revenues through management fees rather than directly through visitor admission fees and visitors to Attractions operated as joint ventures, which, during a portion of the periods under review, included, for example, SEA LIFE Helsinki Oy and Pirate Adventure Golf Limited. We purchased the remaining shares of Pirate Adventure Golf Limited during the 2017 financial year, such that it is now a wholly owned company.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

Given the strength of the LEGO and LEGOLAND brands and the success of our existing LEGOLAND Parks, we recognise significant scope for new LEGOLAND Parks, particularly in the Asian market. Our LEGOLAND Parks are operated under one of our three operating models: (i) ‘‘owned and _operated,’’ (ii) ‘‘leased and operated’’ and (iii) ‘‘manage and operate’’ under management contracts. Of the_ parks currently in operation, five are ‘‘owned and operated,’’ two, LEGOLAND Malaysia and LEGOLAND Dubai, are operated under a management contract, and one, LEGOLAND Japan, is operated under our ‘‘leased and operated’’ model. We opened LEGOLAND Florida, the first LEGOLAND Park launched under our ownership, in October 2011. LEGOLAND Florida is owned and operated by us, with admissions fees reflected directly in revenues for the LEGOLAND Parks operating group. LEGOLAND Malaysia opened in September 2012 and is managed by us pursuant to a management contract with Malaysian partners. The resort was developed with funds provided by the Malaysian government. As part of an agreement for the development and operation of LEGOLAND Malaysia, we contributed fees earned during the development and operating phase back to IDR Resorts Sdn. Bhd. (‘‘IDR’’) which, together with its subsidiaries, owns LEGOLAND Malaysia until we held 20 per cent. of the share capital in IDR. That level has been reached and thus we own 20 per cent. of the company that owns the park and no longer contribute management fees to IDR. We believe this operating model enables us to enter certain new markets, while reducing our risk in those markets. Under the management contract model, we typically receive development and management fees in return for the provision of design, construction and ongoing operational management services; however, we do not own the underlying assets 81 ----- or fund the site’s capital expenditure requirements. The management fee is included in revenues for the LEGOLAND Parks operating group. We have an agreement with LL Theme Parks LLC, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of DXB Entertainments, to operate LEGOLAND Dubai under this management contract model, with no investment in equity. LEGOLAND Dubai opened in 2016. We opened a LEGOLAND Park in Nagoya, Japan in 2017, developed under our ‘‘leased and operated’’ model, whereby we invested in the park with a partner from which we lease unowned assets in exchange for rent. Under this model, we invested approximately one-third of the total park development expenditure, with the balance of the assets, primarily park infrastructure assets, owned by one of KIRKBI’s subsidiaries and funded through a combination of equity and external debt provided by Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. We lease the park and associated assets on arm’s-length commercial terms, paying a turnover based rent with an annual floor on a 50-year lease. See ‘‘Certain Relationships and Related Party _Transactions.’’ During the 2018 financial year, we opened SEA LIFE Nagoya, as well as a 252-room hotel_ at LEGOLAND Japan. In October 2017, we announced plans to open LEGOLAND New York in New York State, U.S. with a targeted opening in 2020, which we have adjusted to 2021 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a complex project and we now expect to spend approximately £340 million, of which approximately £190 million had been spent as at 28 March 2020. LEGOLAND New York will be developed under our ‘‘owned and operated’’ model, consistent with all our U.S. and European LEGOLAND Parks. At the start of 2019, we also announced that an agreement had been reached with Gangwon Provincial Government with respect of partial funding for LEGOLAND Korea, which will be an owned and operated resort, targeted to open by 2022. We intend to invest approximately £190 million in LEGOLAND Korea, of which funding of approximately £135 million will be provided by us and approximately £55 million will come from LL Developments, the investment arm of Gangwon Province. Of this £55 million, approximately £14 million was received by 29 June 2019 and the balance was received in July 2019. Additionally, the funding for necessary additional infrastructure adjacent to LEGOLAND Korea will be provided by national, regional and local governments. The Korean Government Gangwon Province and Chuncheon City have already invested in the construction of the new bridge to Hajungdo Island where LEGOLAND Korea will be located and undertaken groundworks on the site. Out of the total budget of approximately £190 million, we estimate the total spend required to finish the project is approximately £160 million. As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have approximately £24 million remaining of the local government grants received in connection with the funding of LEGOLAND Korea, which we intend to utilise on the next phase of the project spend. In addition, we have also identified tangible opportunities to open new LEGOLAND Parks in China with a focus on operating these parks under management contracts. We have entered into discussions with the local governments and private parties with respect to these development opportunities. See ‘‘Business— _Material Contracts.’’ In September 2019, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to partner_ in the development of LEGOLAND Sichuan and operate it under a management contract arrangement, with the resort scheduled to open by the end of 2023. In addition, in November 2019, we entered into an agreement with the Shanghai Jinshan District Government, CMC Inc. and KIRKBI to develop a LEGOLAND resort in the Jinshan District of Shanghai to open after 2023. Under the terms of the agreement, all parties will form a joint venture company and contribute funding to the construction and development of LEGOLAND Shanghai. We intend to consider LEGOLAND Park development opportunities and the operating models for these opportunities on a case-by-case basis in light of our strategic objectives.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

Accommodation also allows greater cross-selling opportunities and leads to increases in pre-bookings, revenue visibility and positive working capital. During the 2017, 2018 and 2019 financial years, we launched twelve new accommodation developments. During 2017, we opened the 166-room ‘‘Beach Retreat’’ holiday village at LEGOLAND Florida in April, the 61-room ‘‘Castle Hotel’’ at LEGOLAND Windsor in July and the 76-room ‘‘CBeebies Land Hotel’’ at 82 ----- Alton Towers Resort in July. In addition, the holiday village at LEGOLAND Billund was expanded in 2017 to include a further 80 rooms. During 2018, we significantly increased our accommodation offering, adding 644 new rooms through the opening new hotels at three resorts in Germany, Japan and the United States, comprising the 142-room Pirate Island Hotel at LEGOLAND Deutschland, the 252-room hotel at LEGOLAND Japan and the 250 room LEGOLAND California Castle Hotel. Combined with the rooms opened in 2017, this resulted in accommodation revenue growth of 39.7 per cent. within the LEGOLAND Parks operating group, without giving effect to the impact of IFRS 15, and on a constant currency basis. During the 2019 financial year, we opened 372 rooms, including the 128-room Magic Hotel at Gardaland Resort, 102 ‘‘stargazing pods’’ at Alton Towers Resort and the Castle Hotel at LEGOLAND Billund. Our aggregate room capacity was over 4,000 rooms as at 28 December 2019.

During the periods under review, we acquired a minority interest in BIG BUS Tours in 2016 and entered into co-promotion agreements with them in a number of city centre locations. We believe that by working more closely with BIG BUS Tours, we can increase cross promotion and drive visitor traffic to our Attractions. In addition, as part of our overall growth strategy, we proactively manage the composition of our portfolio and have occasionally disposed of certain of our businesses and assets to increase efficiencies, profit and cash flows or to reduce liabilities. On 21 February 2019, we entered into an agreement to sell our Australian ski resorts at Mount Hotham and Falls Creek to Vail Resorts Inc. We completed the sale on 5 April 2019 for a total cash-consideration of A$174 million. These Attractions formed part of the Midway Attractions operating group. In 2018, revenue and underlying EBITDA for the two sites were £35 million and £11 million, respectively. In the 2019 financial year, we also closed, sold or otherwise transferred five Midway Attractions, comprising Hotham Ski Field, Falls Creek Ski Field, SEA LIFE Chongqing, The Jurassic Skyline and Wild Life Hamilton Island.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

In the 2019 financial year, 39 per cent. of our revenue was derived from our LEGOLAND Parks and 22 per cent. of our revenue was derived from our Resort Theme Parks operations, which are primarily organised around outdoor activities, and 39 per cent. of our revenue was derived from our Midway Attractions operating group, which is primarily organised around indoor activities, mitigating the impact of adverse weather. However, unfavourable weather and forecasts of unfavourable weather, especially during our peak opening period and on or for weekend days, can adversely affect visitor attendance at the Attractions and, consequently, our financial performance, particularly at our LEGOLAND and Resort Theme Parks Attractions. The Midway Attractions operating group can also be impacted by weather conditions. Unlike our Resort Theme Parks and our LEGOLAND Parks, almost all of our Midway Attractions are located indoors and thus hot weather can have a negative impact on visitor numbers as potential visitors are diverted to outdoor Attractions, such as theme parks. We believe that in 2017, the weather negatively impacted the trading performance at Gardaland Resort as well as at Heide-Park Resort and LEGOLAND Florida. We believe that in 2018, very favourable weather in both the United Kingdom and Continental Europe allowed for a more positive market backdrop to attract visitors, particularly to our Resort Theme Parks, including the major resorts at Alton Towers Resort and Gardaland Resort. We believe that in 2019, our LEGOLAND Parks faced difficult trading conditions from poor weather in a number of our markets, but that our Resort Theme Parks faced favourable Easter weather in the United Kingdom, which allowed for a more positive market backdrop to attract visitors. We seek to reduce the risk to our operations imposed by unfavourable weather conditions through the use of an advance purchase pricing model for online ticket sales, providing a discount to customers who book in advance, as well as sales of Merlin Annual Passes, Merlin Pass Monthly Memberships and individual Attraction season passes. We also seek to draw trade visitors, such as coach tours and school visits, to the 83 ----- Attractions, and the vast majority of these trade visitors book tickets in advance. Our strategy of transforming our Resort Theme Parks and LEGOLAND Parks into destination resorts, chiefly by the development of accommodation facilities, further supports pre-booked ticket sales by encouraging visitors to plan multi-day trips further in advance. In the 2019 financial year, approximately 62 per cent. of our revenue from admissions was pre-booked, of which 10 per cent. came through Merlin passes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

The majority of our revenue is generated between mid-March and November due to a variety of factors affecting the northern hemisphere, where the majority of the Attractions are located. Such factors include school holiday periods, with the longest peak during July and August and shorter peaks during the Easter and (in the United Kingdom) October school holiday periods, and generally favourable weather conditions. The timing of the Easter holiday each year may affect our results of operations because when the Easter holiday occurs later in the year, it is more likely to coincide with periods of favourable weather. In the 2018 financial year, excluding the impact of IFRS 15, 24 per cent. of our revenue was generated between January and April, 18 per cent. of our revenue was generated between May and June, 38 per cent. of our revenue was generated between July and September, and 20 per cent. of our revenue was generated between October and December. These results are representative of the effect of seasonal variation on our revenue during the periods under review. During the winter months (November to mid-March in the northern hemisphere), our revenue reduces substantially and, in particular, our seasonal Attractions (including most of the Resort Theme Parks and the European LEGOLAND Parks) are either closed or open for more limited hours during certain periods. Even at the Attractions that are open year-round, including LEGOLAND Florida, LEGOLAND California and all of our Midway Attractions, attendance patterns have historically experienced significant seasonality, driven by, amongst other factors, tourism patterns and school holidays. We typically incur capital expenditure during the winter months (which vary depending on the location of the Attractions) in carrying out maintenance and refurbishment work and the addition of new rides to the Resort Theme Parks and LEGOLAND Parks. We seek to manage our expenses to match this seasonality in revenue by the use of seasonal employees during the peak months. Additionally, our recent expansion in the United States, Asia and Australia has created some variance in peak seasons between our Attractions. This increasing geographical diversification is a part of our growth strategy that we believe will, over time, reduce the effects of seasonality on our business. The seasonality of our business may also, from time to time, cause our results to be affected disproportionately by any significant ‘‘one-off’’ events that occur in our principal trading markets during the peak seasons of operation. Such ‘‘one-off’’ events may impact particular financial years and may make comparability across different financial years more difficult. For example, in 2017, two terror attacks in London impacted visitor attendance at some of our Attractions in the peak season that followed the attacks.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

Low economic growth in many of the countries in which we operate, coupled with future economic uncertainty, has had and continues to have an adverse effect on consumers’ discretionary spending and consumer confidence. Our business has historically demonstrated resilience during periods of economic slowdown. We believe our resilience in adverse economic conditions is due to, amongst other reasons, consumer spending on family visitor Attractions tending to be more resistant to cutbacks than many other forms of discretionary spending during periods of economic downturn. Additionally, the Attractions may represent a less expensive holiday or leisure alternative compared to overseas travel holidays for domestic customers in the countries in which we operate. Following the U.K. referendum on Brexit in June 2016, sterling weakened considerably relative to other world currencies. As 69, 69 and 68 per cent. of our revenue in the 2017, 2018 and 2019 financial years, respectively, was derived from other countries, notably the United States and continental Europe, we saw positive translation effects that benefitted our results for the 2017, 2018 and 2019 financial years. In the medium term, we believe a more competitive pound could increase in-bound tourism to London and drive 84 ----- more ‘‘staycations’’ on the part of U.K. residents. As over two-thirds of our visitors were domestic visitors in 2018, a trend, we believe, was similar in 2019, we are not reliant upon the ‘‘fly-in’’ markets. Notwithstanding this general resilience to economic downturns, significant macroeconomic events in the countries in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our performance, and unemployment may also play a significant role in the level of discretionary consumer spending and, in particular, the unemployment level amongst our target demographics may affect visitor attendance levels and revenues at certain Attractions. For example, the performance of THORPE PARK Resort, another of our largest Attractions by visitor numbers, is subject to movements in the employment rate of its key target customers in the 16-24 age group.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

We believe we own and operate a unique portfolio of chainable iconic assets and brands, which possess a strong heritage within their original markets, and which are globally scalable and supported by our extensive technical and creative expertise. Our success implementing this strategy is a key driver of our growth and financial performance. The geographic scope of our business has expanded significantly since our inception, and now includes a portfolio of Attractions across Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific region. Our long-term goal is to evenly split our revenue between Europe, North and South America and the Asia-Pacific region. Expanding into new cities and countries allows us to continually increase the number of Attractions in our portfolio, which in turn helps to increase visitor numbers and revenues. This also provides us with some opportunities to create ‘‘clusters,’’ developing multiple Attractions in one city or region to capitalise on operational, marketing and cross-selling advantages. Geographical diversification can also reduce the effects of seasonality. With Attractions in different cities, countries and hemispheres, there is some variance in peak seasons between Attractions. The Asia-Pacific region, in particular, represents an area of increasing strategic focus for us, with a growing number of Midway Attractions and LEGOLAND Parks located in the region. We have opened four new Midway Attractions in the Asia-Pacific region in 2019, comprising LEGOLAND Discovery Centres in Beijing and Shenyang and SEA LIFE Attractions in Malaysia and Shenyang, and we closed, sold or otherwise transferred four Midway Attractions in the Asia-Pacific region in 2019, comprising Hotham Ski Field, Falls Creek Ski Field, SEA LIFE Chongqing and Wild Life Hamilton Island. By the end of the 2019 financial year, we operated 36 Attractions in ten countries across the Asia-Pacific region. In the coming years, we plan to open a LEGOLAND Park in South Korea, additional Midway Attractions throughout the region and have identified potential sites for LEGOLAND Parks in China with a focus on operating these parks under management contracts, such as LEGOLAND Sichuan. We have a number of study agreements in China in progress. For further information, see ‘‘—Development of LEGOLAND Parks.’’ Geographical diversification also provides us with a degree of natural hedging against certain external factors, such as variations in weather, localised economic downturns and other localised events that may have a temporary or sustained impact on visitor numbers at particular Attractions. This geographical expansion and diversification requires careful strategic planning and active management as we enter jurisdictions with different legal, political and economic circumstances, such as Madame Tussauds Delhi, which we opened in 2017. We may enter a new jurisdiction in multiple ways. In addition to launching new sites on our own, we may enter a new jurisdiction by acquiring and rebranding existing leisure attractions, as demonstrated by our acquisitions of the Sydney Attractions Group and Living and Leisure Australia, or by entering into partnership with local governments or third-parties, as reflected by LEGOLAND Malaysia, LEGOLAND Dubai and LEGOLAND Korea. We consider entering into new jurisdictions, including the method of entering into such jurisdictions, on a case-by-case basis in light of our strategic objectives.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

We define ‘‘admissions revenue per capita’’ as the amount of revenue each visitor provides by way of admission fees. Admissions revenue per capita is a function of the lead price (being the full price for visitors), excluding VAT and other sales taxes, and any promotional discounts we provide. To maximise total revenue and profit, we continuously monitor both visitor volumes and admissions yield, being the admissions revenue per capita divided by the lead price, for each of the 85 ----- Attractions. Our revenue per capita has increased from approximately £18 for each of the 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 financial years to approximately £21 to £22 in each of the 2017, 2018 and 2019 financial years. Decisions about volume and yield strategies for each Attraction are made weekly, monthly, quarterly and annually by central and local management. In making these decisions, management seeks to respond to changing patterns of demand, taking into account a wide variety of factors, including prevailing economic circumstances, the time of year, the age of an Attractions and the Attractions’ propositions, customer ratings of ‘‘value for money’’ and target audience. Both volume and yield strategies rely on our ability to implement effective pricing and marketing strategies. We can achieve higher volumes for an individual Attraction through the use of entry promotions and admission fee discounts. We can use such promotions and discounts to distribute visitor attendance across an Attraction’s opening hours or opening period. For example, we may offer discounts for off-peak times of day or off-peak days, thereby improving visitor volumes during those times. We may also use promotions to help establish Attractions in local markets, typically using promotions in the second year after opening once the initial heightened visitor volumes associated with a new launch have subsided. We can also affect the admissions revenue per capita for an individual Attraction by incrementally increasing an Attraction’s lead price and/or changing the quantum or level of discounts offered in respect of an Attraction’s admission fee. We seek to increase revenue and profit generated during an Attraction’s periods of peak demand and by high-demand Attractions by increasing the admissions revenue per capita during those periods and for those Attractions. Similar to decisions about volume and yield strategies for individual Attractions, decisions about volume and yield strategies for Merlin Annual Passes, Merlin Pass Monthly Memberships and individual Attraction seasonal passes are made regularly by central management to respond to changing patterns of demand and use.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

For example, in the 2019 financial year, 32 per cent. of our revenue was generated in pounds sterling, 25 per cent. in euro and Danish Kroner and 28 per cent. in U.S. dollars. Our financial performance is therefore subject to fluctuations as a result of foreign currency exchange rate movements whenever financial information is translated from non-pounds sterling currencies. To eliminate the impact of foreign exchange movements on our reported revenue and EBITDA, management uses revenue and EBITDA on a constant currency basis to evaluate business performance. We also seek to structure our indebtedness in currencies that help reduce translational foreign exchange exposure by drawing debt denominated in our major currencies of operation. In addition to the translational impact of exchange rate fluctuations, we are exposed to transactional exchange rate risk. Certain operating expenses and capital expenditures are from time to time denominated in foreign currencies, though in general, most payments and revenues are denominated in the same local currencies used in the countries in which we have Attractions. Additionally, we seek to limit our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations through the use of derivative instruments under an approved control framework.

Staff expenses as a percentage of revenues have therefore remained broadly stable over the periods under review, with expenses increasing in-line with revenues primarily as a result of the roll-out and development of new Attractions. 86 ----- Due to the seasonality of our business, employee headcount varies significantly throughout the year. We manage our employment costs by hiring a substantial number of workers on a flexible, seasonal basis, which is typical for operators of seasonal attractions in the leisure industry. Depending on the Attraction, and subject to the relevant laws and regulations of the jurisdiction in which the Attraction is located, seasonal employees are hired for the entire summer season or on a periodic basis, in each case with flexible arrangements, enabling us to vary the hours worked as we deem necessary. Although the use of seasonal employees provides us with a certain amount of flexibility on our cost base, our ability to make substantial savings through headcount reduction of seasonal employees during the opening period may be constrained by the limited advance visibility of visitor numbers and for some Attractions, such as Gardaland Resort, certain restrictions imposed by local employment laws. Our average number of permanent employees for the 2017, 2018 and 2019 financial years was 8,781, 8,909 and 9,567, respectively. Our average number of total employees for the 2017, 2018 and 2019 financial years was 19,871, 20,736 and 21,302, respectively, with the difference reflecting seasonal or temporary employees.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

In the 2018 financial year and prior to the adoption of IFRS 16, we originally reported an expense of £107 million in our income statement with respect to operating leases. Our operating leases typically have a duration of between 10 and 60 years. As at 30 December 2018, we adopted IFRS 16 (Leases). As a consequence of adopting IFRS 16, which does not distinguish between operating and finance leases for lessees, rental expense has now been replaced with new depreciation and interest charges. See ‘‘—Additional Factors Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations—Changes to _Accounting Standards—IFRS 16.’’_ Our Midway Attractions are predominately leasehold properties, with the exception of three freehold SEA LIFE sites, Madame Tussauds Blackpool and the Blackpool Tower complex, which we operate pursuant to a management agreement and the London Eye, which we hold pursuant to a licence. Madame Tussauds London formed part of the 2007 sale and leaseback arrangement with Prestbury (the predecessor in title of Secure Income REIT plc), which subsequently sold the freehold to Fubon MTL Property (Jersey) Ltd. with no changes to the terms of the lease. See ‘‘Business—Property’’ and ‘‘Business—Material Contracts’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.’’ In general, we have historically held freehold interests in our LEGOLAND Parks, however we operate LEGOLAND Malaysia under a management contract, although we hold an equity interest in the project company that owns the park assets. We operate LEGOLAND Dubai pursuant to a management contract and operate LEGOLAND Japan under our ‘‘leased and operated’’ model with other third-party investors.

Accordingly, amounts presented may not be attributable to each of, or only, the Attractions opened in that period. In 2017, we opened a new Midway Attraction brand in Berlin called Little BIG City. In 2018, we opened seven new Midway Attractions, which comprised LEGOLAND Discovery Centre in Birmingham, the Shanghai Dungeon, LEGOLAND Discovery Centre in Columbus, Peppa Pig World of Play in Shanghai, The Bear Grylls Adventure in Birmingham, Little BIG City in Beijing and SEA LIFE Nagoya. In 2019, we opened eight new Midway Attractions, which comprised the Alton Towers Dungeon, LEGOLAND Discovery Centres in Beijing, San Antonio and Shenyang, SEA LIFE Attractions in Malaysia and Shenyang and Peppa Pig World of Play in Dallas and Michigan. The development costs on each of these sites varies depending on the nature and size of the Attraction. For example, Peppa Pig World of Play Attractions require less capital investment, reflecting the size and the nature of the Attraction. In connection with the Midway Attractions that we have recently rolled out, we strategically created ‘‘clusters,’’ developing multiple Attractions in one city or region to capitalise on costs, cross-selling and marketing opportunities. Clustering Attractions also allows us to achieve logistical benefits, including the sharing of management and administrative functions across Attractions and, in some cases, the sharing of premises, which helps reduce costs and improve EBITDA margins.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

187,Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.9,Additional Factors Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations,17.9.2,Changes to Accounting Standards,"_IFRS 16_ Our consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS. On 13 January 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16 (Leases), and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on 9 November 2017. IFRS 16 replaced IAS 17 and the related IFRIC and SIC interpretations, and resulted in almost all leases being recognised on the balance sheet, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is eliminated. Under the new standard, the lessee recognises an asset (the right to use the leased asset) and a financial liability to pay lease payments. The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases. IFRS 16 is effective for fiscal years commencing on or after 1 January 2019. We adopted IFRS 16 initially on 30 December 2018, using the fully retrospective approach. The cumulative effect of adopting IFRS 16 is therefore recognised, in-line with IAS 8 (Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors), by restating the 52-week period ending 29 December 2018 and making an opening equity adjustment as at 31 December 2017. We are not required to make any adjustment for leases in which we are a lessor except where we are an intermediate lessor in a sub-lease. We have applied the practical expedient to grandfather the definition of a lease on transition. This means that IFRS 16 has been applied to all contracts entered into before 30 December 2018 and identified as leases in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC. IFRS 16 has an impact on our reported assets, liabilities and income statement. In particular, as a consequence of IFRS 16 our total assets and liabilities have increased as the right-of-use asset associated with leases, and the corresponding liability, previously treated as operating leases are recognised on the balance sheet. In addition, rent expense is replaced with new depreciation and interest charges, and as a result, our EBITDA has increased. As at 29 December 2018, our future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases amounted to £1,852 million (2017: £1,897 million) on an undiscounted basis. Of these commitments, an insignificant value relates to short-term and low-value leases which continued to be recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense within the income statement. Based on results for the 2018 financial year, the impact on EBITDA of adopting IFRS 16 was an increase of approximately £84 million for the 2018 financial year, as originally reported. Due to our most significant leases being in their earlier stages, the ‘‘front loading’’ impact of the finance costs results in an initial reduction in reported earnings. There was a decrease in underlying profit before tax of £13 million for the 52 weeks ended 29 December 2018. We recognised right-of-use (‘‘ROU’’) assets of £993 million, including ROU assets in respect of existing finance leases and asset retirement provisions on leased properties, both previously classified under property, plant and equipment as at 30 December 2018. We recognised total lease liabilities of £1,183 million, including existing finance lease liabilities of £200 million as at 30 December 2018 and the impact of adopting IFRS 16 on net debt was therefore £983 million as at 30 December 2018. A net adjustment to accruals, prepayments and provisions reduced liabilities by £27 million, primarily resulting from the de-recognition of balances in relation to IAS 17 lease accounting where leases were expensed to the income statement on a straight-line basis as at 30 December 2018. Deferred tax assets also increased by £33 million as at 30 December 2018. The adjustments have in aggregate resulted in a decrease in net assets of £105 million as at 30 December 2018. This information may not be indicative of the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 on our total assets, total liabilities and EBITDA for the next financial year or any future period. In order to facilitate a comparison of our results of operations and financial condition for the 2018 and 2019 financial years, we include in this Offering Memorandum a restatement of the audited consolidated financial statements of Merlin and its subsidiaries as at and for the 52 weeks ended 29 December 2018 to give effect to the application of IFRS 16 and to separately present the results from discontinued operations from those from continuing operations, as described in, and extracted from, the audited consolidated financial statements of Merlin and its subsidiaries as at and for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019. Accordingly, our results of operations and financial condition for the 2018 financial year, as presented in this Offering Memorandum on a restated basis, are limited in comparability to our results of operations 88 ----- and financial condition for the 2017 financial year, which were prepared before the first application of IFRS 16 and before the sale of our Australian ski resorts and which have not been restated in this Offering Memorandum to give effect to the application of IFRS 16 and to separately present the results from discontinued operations from those from continuing operations. See ‘‘—Discontinued Operations.’’ _IFRS 15_ IFRS 15 (Revenue from contracts with customers) establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. It replaced IAS 18 (Revenue), IAS 11 (Construction contracts) and related interpretations. We have adopted IFRS 15 using the cumulative effect method (without practical expedients). This approach requires the effect of applying this standard to be recognised at the date of initial application, on 31 December 2017. There is no impact to retained earnings on transition because the timing of recognition of each category of our revenue under the transfer of risks and rewards principles in IAS 18 matches the timing under the control principles in IFRS 15. IFRS 15 requires us to make an assessment, considering the control principles of IFRS 15, as to whether parties involved in providing goods or services to a customer are acting as a principal (if they control delivery to the customer) or, if they are arranging for those goods or services to be provided by the other party, as an agent. Under IAS 18, this assessment was made based on which entity had the exposure to the significant risks and rewards associated with the transaction. We have reviewed how this change affects situations where a third-party is involved with us in providing visitors to the Attractions with admission tickets and/or accommodation, or commercial offerings such as photos and games services once inside an Attraction. There is no difference in the pattern of revenue recognition arising from this change. There was no material impact on our statement of financial position, statement of cash flows or statement of comprehensive income in the 2018 financial year. In the 2018 financial year, the application of IFRS 15 created an increase in revenue of £35 million and an equal and opposite increase in cost of sales. This primarily results from revenue derived from third-party arrangements such as tickets purchased through online travel agents. Under IFRS 15, and depending on the terms of the relevant contractual arrangements, we record revenue at the higher amount paid by the visiting customer rather than the lower amount received from the intermediary third-party. In addition, we partner with third-parties in the operation of in-Attraction offerings such as photo operations and games, where there are some small changes in revenue, depending on the role of each party in the operation of those offerings. We have not made any adjustments to our reported results for the 2017 financial year, and the application of IFRS 15 has had a negligible impact on EBITDA. Under IFRS 15, the following categories of revenue (all excluding VAT and similar taxes) have been disaggregated: - Visitor revenue, which represents admissions tickets, retail, food and beverage sales and other commercial offerings such as photos and games experiences inside an Attraction. Ticket revenue is recognised at point of entry. Revenue from annual passes and other tickets that entitle a customer to continued visits over a period of time is deferred and then recognised evenly over the period that the pass is valid. Retail and food and beverage revenue, along with other similar commercial offerings, is recognised at point of sale. - Accommodation revenue, which represents overnight stay and conference room revenue along with food and beverage revenue earned within our hotels and other accommodation offerings. Accommodation revenue is recognised at the time when a customer stays at our accommodations. - Other revenue, which represents sponsorship, function, management and service contract revenue along with other sundry items. Sponsorship revenue is recognised over the relevant contract term. Function revenue is recognised at the time of the event. Management and service contract revenue is recognised in-line with the performance obligations in the specific contract.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

The spread of COVID-19 has had a material negative impact on our business, resulting in the current temporary closure of substantially all of our Attractions. Since the global COVID-19 crisis began, we have adopted swift measures to significantly reduce cash outflows in the form of operating cost and cash control measures, which has resulted in an approximately 45 per cent. reduction of operating expenses against our budget. In addition, we have implemented several cost-cutting and cash-savings measures, and under a scenario where our Attractions remain largely closed but in a state of readiness to reopen during 2020, we estimate that our net average operational cash outflow (including non-deferred rent) will be approximately £50 million per month after interest, mandated debt amortisation, tax and capital expenditure on our Existing Estate. The effect of the global COVID-19 pandemic on our business and the wider attractions industry will ultimately depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the outbreak and the length of time it takes for demand and pricing to return and for normal economic and operating conditions to resume.

(2) See ‘‘Presentation of Financial Information—Non-IFRS Financial Information,’’ ‘‘Presentation of Financial Information’’ and footnote (2) under the caption ‘‘Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data—Other Operating, _Financial and Pro forma Financial Information’’ for a discussion as to how we define and calculate EBITDA and Underlying_ EBITDA as well as a discussion as to other considerations with respect to using EBITDA and Underlying EBITDA to assess our financial performance. _Revenue_ Revenue increased by £87 million, or 5 per cent., to £1,740 million for the 2019 financial year from £1,653 million in the 2018 financial year. This increase was driven by the contribution from the opening of new Midway Attractions and the expansion of the accommodation offering at our theme parks. In our Midway Attractions, we saw a gradual improvement in London visitation and trading elsewhere was generally solid, whilst in Resort Theme Parks, we saw continued revenue growth. Offsetting this, trading in LEGOLAND Parks was however, more challenging. Although we enjoyed a strong Easter and Spring Break performance, subsequent trading was affected by poor weather, difficult conditions in a number of markets and limited momentum from ‘‘The LEGO Movie 2.’’ _Cost of Sales_ Cost of sales increased by £22 million, or 7 per cent., to £317 million for the 2019 financial year from £295 million in the 2018 financial year. This increase was driven primarily by increased visitor revenues, including sales of food and beverages and merchandise, together with the growth of our portfolio of accommodation. 93 ----- _Staff Expenses_ Staff expenses increased by £46 million, or 11 per cent., to £482 million for the 2019 financial year from £436 million in the 2018 financial year. This increase was driven by staff expenses representing share-based payment and bonus costs that were either accelerated or otherwise specifically incurred in connection with the Acquisition. _Marketing_ Marketing expenses increased by £7 million, or 8 per cent., to £90 million for the 2019 financial year from £83 million in the 2018 financial year. This increase was driven primarily by increased marketing in connection with the launch of new Attractions in new markets and new accommodations at our sites, together with marketing initiatives relating to our Existing Estate. _Other Operating Expenses_ Other operating expenses increased by £78 million, or 28 per cent., to £355 million for the 2019 financial year from £277 million in the 2018 financial year. This increase was driven primarily by exceptional items, being transaction costs in relation to the Acquisition and productivity agenda activities, which together constituted £50 million in 2019. New openings and ongoing cost pressures across our group, partially offset by savings generated by our productivity agenda also contributed to the increase. _Depreciation, Amortisation and Impairment_ Depreciation, amortisation and impairment amounted to £265 million for the 2019 financial year, an increase of £56 million, or 27 per cent., from £209 million in the 2018 financial year. This increase was primarily due to the continued investment in our Existing Estate and the roll-out of new Attractions and accommodation at our sites and impairment charges of £38 million, primarily in respect of certain Midway Attractions. _Operating Profit_ Operating profit decreased by £122 million or 35 per cent., to £231 million for the 2019 financial year from £353 million in the 2018 financial year. This decrease was driven primarily by the factors discussed above. _Finance Income_ Finance income increased by £42 million to £52 million for the 2019 financial year from £10 million in the 2018 financial year. Finance income in 2019 was primarily attributable to exceptional foreign exchange gains which resulted from foreign exchange exposures (prior to them being hedged) on certain financing arrangements with parent companies entered into as a result of the Acquisition. Finance income in �2018 was primarily attributable to cash flow hedges reclassified to profit and loss. _Finance Costs_ Finance costs increased by £51 million, or 52 per cent., to £150 million for the 2019 financial year from £99 million for the 2018 financial year. This increase was driven primarily by higher interest charges in the last two months of 2019 following the Acquisition, which resulted in higher levels of inter-company borrowings and cost of early settlement of A700 million seven year notes shortly after the Acquisition. _Taxation_ Taxation increased by £4 million, or 8 per cent., to £53 million for the 2019 financial year from £49 million in the 2018 financial year. This increase was attributable to a number of factors, including our geographic mix of profits, non-deductible interest expense in the U.K. and United States and the non-recognition of tax losses. _Profit for the Year_ Profit for the year decreased by £98 million, or 45 per cent., to £122 million for the 2019 financial year from £220 million in the 2018 financial year. This decrease was primarily driven by the factors discussed above and offset by a profit of £42 million from the sale of discontinued operations. 94 ----- _EBITDA_ EBITDA decreased by £66 million, or 12 per cent., to £496 million for the 2019 financial year from £562 million in the 2018 financial year. This decrease was primarily caused by one-off exceptional items related to the Acquisition in the 2019 financial year. Please see ‘‘Presentation of Financial Information—Non-IFRS Financial Information,’’ ‘‘Presentation of _Financial Information’’ and footnote (2) under the caption ‘‘Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data—Other Operating, Financial and Pro forma Financial Information’’ for a_ discussion as to how we define and calculate EBITDA, as well as a discussion as to other considerations with respect to using EBITDA to assess our financial performance.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

This increase was driven primarily by growth in the Existing Estate and the contribution by New Business Development from the roll-out of new Attractions. Our London division, the largest of our five regional divisions, continued to improve in the 2019 financial year, benefiting from stronger inbound tourism as it recovered following the terrorist attacks of 2017, and as a result of the weaker Sterling. Our performance was also impacted by the re-opening of the LEGOLAND Discovery Centre in Shanghai, following a temporary closure in 2018. Our revenue growth was partially offset by the significant decrease in the number of visitors following the removal of the beluga whales from Chang Feng Ocean World in Shanghai. Segment EBITDA from the Midway Attractions operating group decreased by £6 million, or 2 per cent., to £240 million for the 2019 financial year from £246 million in the 2018 financial year. This decrease was driven by revenue growth, offset by costs incurred in connection with the significant investment in the openings of new brands and Attractions in new markets, together with ongoing cost pressures relating to the Existing Estate. 95 ----- _LEGOLAND Parks_ The following table sets out certain financial measures and percentage change in those items for the LEGOLAND Parks operating group along with the number of visitors for the 2018 and 2019 financial years:",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

This increase was driven by the continued roll-out of new accommodation, including 142-rooms at the Castle Hotel at LEGOLAND Billund Resort, offsetting the impact of the poor weather and difficult trading conditions in a number of markets. Segment EBITDA from the LEGOLAND Parks operating group decreased by £5 million to £243 million for the 2019 financial year from £248 million in the 2018 financial year. This decrease was driven primarily by continued cost pressures and, to a lesser extent, increasing pre-opening costs related to LEGOLAND New York. _Resort Theme Parks_ Due to the nature and location of the Attractions in the Resort Theme Parks operating group, this operating group is generally impacted more by seasonality than our other two operating groups. The majority of revenue generated at the Resort Theme Parks typically occurs in the second half of each financial year, in particular, during the peak months of July and August.

(3) See ‘‘Presentation of Financial Information—Non-IFRS Financial Information,’’ ‘‘Presentation of Financial Information’’ and footnote (2) under the caption ‘‘Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data—Other Operating, Financial and Pro forma Financial Information’’ for a discussion as to how we define and calculate EBITDA and Underlying EBITDA as well as a discussion as to other considerations with respect to using EBITDA and Underlying EBITDA to assess our financial performance. _Revenue_ Revenue increased by £94 million, or 6 per cent., to £1,688 million for the 2018 financial year from £1,594 million in the 2017 financial year. This increase was driven by like-for-like growth in the Resort Theme Parks operating group of 9 per cent. and stable performances in the LEGOLAND Parks and Midway Attractions operating groups. New accommodation across the estate added £44 million to revenue growth, and the opening of seven new Midway Attractions, together with the full-year benefit of Midway Attractions that opened in the 2017 financial year, contributed £11 million to revenue growth. Study agreements regarding prospective LEGOLAND Parks, together with the full-year effect of LEGOLAND Japan, resulted in a further £2 million contribution to revenue. In addition, during the 2018 financial year, we adopted IFRS 15, the new accounting standard for revenue accounting, which created an increase in revenue of £35 million. This primarily results from revenue derived from third-party arrangements such as tickets purchased through online travel agents. _Cost of Sales_ Cost of sales increased by £43 million, or 17 per cent., to £298 million for the 2018 financial year from £255 million in the 2017 financial year. This increase was driven primarily by the adoption of IFRS 15, which created an increase in cost of sales of £35 million. This primarily results from third-party arrangements such as ticket sales through online travel agents. Cost of sales represented 18 per cent. of our revenue in the 2018 financial year, a slight increase from 16 per cent. for the 2017 financial year. 97 ----- _Staff Expenses_ Staff expenses increased by £28 million, or 7 per cent., to £448 million for the 2018 financial year from £420 million in the 2017 financial year. This increase was driven primarily by an increase in the average number of persons employed, which increased by 1,252, or 6 per cent., to 21,123 in the 2018 financial year from 19,871 in the 2017 financial year. Staff expenses represented 27 per cent. of our revenue in the 2018 financial year, a slight increase from 26 per cent. for the 2017 financial year. _Marketing_ Marketing expenses decreased by £1 million, or 1 per cent., to £84 million for the 2018 financial year from £85 million in the 2017 financial year. Marketing expenses represented 5 per cent. of our revenue in both the 2018 and 2017 financial years. _Rent_ Rent increased by £1 million, or 1 per cent., to £105 million for the 2018 financial year from £104 million in the 2017 financial year. Rent payments represented 6 per cent. of our revenue in the 2018 financial year, a slight decrease from 7 per cent. in the 2017 financial year. _Other Operating Expenses_ Other operating expenses increased by £7 million, or 3 per cent., to £263 million for the 2018 financial year from £256 million in the 2017 financial year. This increase resulted from the roll-out of new Attractions, new accommodation and other cost increases. Other operating expenses represented 16 per cent. of our revenue in both the 2018 and 2017 financial years. _Depreciation and Amortisation_ The following table sets out depreciation and amortisation and percentage change for the 2017 and 2018 financial years:",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

This increase was driven primarily by the closing of derivative positions as part of the refinancing which took place during the 2018 financial year, together with the benefit of foreign exchange movements. 98 ----- _Finance Costs_ Finance costs decreased by £7 million, or 13 per cent., to £48 million for the 2018 financial year from £55 million in the 2017 financial year. This decrease was primarily due to a change in 2017 that arose due to the accounting impact of reassessing the refinancing date of our existing banking facilities. _Taxation_ Taxation decreased by £7 million, or 11 per cent., to £55 million for the 2018 financial year from £62 million in the 2017 financial year. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of changes in the tax legislation in the United States. The tax charge of £55 million represents an effective tax rate of 19.2 per cent. of underlying profit before tax, which has fallen from 22.9 per cent. in 2017, primarily due to the impact of changes in tax legislation in the United States. Excluding prior year adjustments, which related primarily to these legislative changes, our effective tax rate would have been 23.5 per cent. _Profit for the Year_ Profit increased by £21 million, or 10 per cent., to £230 million for the 2018 financial year from £209 million in the 2017 financial year, as a result of the factors discussed above. _EBITDA_ EBITDA increased by £16 million, or 3 per cent., to £490 million for the 2018 financial year from £474 million in the 2017 financial year. This increase was primarily due to strong trading within Resort Theme Parks and the increased accommodation offering across the theme parks, partially offset by cost pressures, such as those arising from wage legislation and property taxes. In addition, £4 million of exceptional costs were incurred in connection with our productivity agenda initiatives. Like-for-like EBITDA increased by 0.4 per cent. for the 2018 financial year in comparison to 1 per cent. for the 2017 financial year. This increase was driven primarily by the factors affecting our results of operations by operating groups as described below. Organic growth at a constant currency increased by 6 per cent.

This increase was driven primarily by the adoption of IFRS 15 and the roll-out of seven new Attractions, which comprised LEGOLAND Discovery Centre in Birmingham, the Shanghai Dungeon, LEGOLAND Discovery Centre in Columbus, Peppa Pig World of Play in Shanghai, The Bear Grylls Adventure in Birmingham, Little BIG City in Beijing and SEA LIFE Nagoya. Without giving effect to the adoption of IFRS 15, revenue during the 2018 financial year would have been £650 million, representing a decrease of £6 million, or 1 per cent., from the 2017 financial year, partly due to the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on reported revenues. Segment EBITDA from the Midway Attractions operating group decreased by £10 million, or 5 per cent., to £210 million for the 2018 financial year from £220 million in the 2017 financial year. This decrease was driven primarily by costs relating to greater investment in the openings of new brands or new Attractions in new markets, together with non-recurring factors including the temporary closing of the LEGOLAND Discovery Centre in Shanghai and the non-recurrence of a sales tax rebate received in the 2017 financial year. _LEGOLAND Parks_ The following table sets out certain financial measures and percentage change in those items for the LEGOLAND Parks operating group along with the number of visitors for the 2017 and 2018 financial years:",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

This increase was driven primarily by the roll-out of new accommodation, comprising the 142-room Pirate Island Hotel at LEGOLAND Deutschland, the 252-room hotel at LEGOLAND Japan and the 250 room LEGOLAND California Castle Hotel and, to a lesser extent, by the adoption of IFRS 15. Without giving effect to the adoption of IFRS 15, the revenue during the 2018 financial year would have been £636 million, representing an increase of £27 million, or 4 per cent., from the 2017 financial year. Segment EBITDA from the LEGOLAND Parks operating group increased by £12 million, or 5 per cent., to £242 million for the 2018 financial year from £230 million in the 2017 financial year. This increase was driven primarily by the improved profitability of LEGOLAND Japan due to the non-recurrence of pre-opening costs, the opening of a new hotel and of SEA LIFE at the park, partially offset by cost inflation across the operating group. 100 ----- _Resort Theme Parks_ Due to the nature and location of the Attractions in the Resort Theme Parks operating group, this operating group is generally impacted more by seasonality than our other two operating groups. The majority of revenue generated at the Resort Theme Parks typically occurs in the second half of each financial year, in particular, during the peak months of July and August. During the 2018 financial year, the Resort Theme Parks operating group has enjoyed strong trading throughout the peak summer season and the Halloween period, which is now one of the most important trading periods of the year, due to successful product offerings such as ‘‘Scarefest’’ at Alton Towers Resort.

Without giving effect to the adoption of IFRS 15, the revenue during the 2018 financial year would have been £360 million, representing an increase of £31 million, or 9 per cent., from the 2017 financial year. Segment EBITDA from the Resort Theme Parks operating group increased by £16 million, or 22 per cent., to £88 million for the 2018 financial year from £72 million in the 2017 financial year.

Historically, the principal variations in our borrowing requirements and our principal uses of funds have been in respect of investments in our Existing Estate, the roll-out and development of new Attractions and the acquisition of new businesses. As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, our principal use of funds is in respect of funding ongoing operational expenditure. Our business has historically been highly cash generative during our main trading period (mid-March to November), with additional cash generation occurring in December and January with respect to certain of our year-round Attractions and our Attractions located in the southern hemisphere. Our revenue is primarily driven by visitor attendance at the Attractions. Receivables from trade debtors do not constitute a significant portion of our current assets, as the majority of our customers pay either in advance or at the time of their visit. During the winter months in the northern hemisphere, when our seasonal Attractions (including most of the Resort Theme Parks and European LEGOLAND Parks) are generally closed or have reduced opening hours and generate substantially lower revenue than during our main trading period, we generate losses and typically incur capital expenditure in carrying out maintenance and refurbishment work and investments to upgrade and refresh our Existing Estate. Reflecting this seasonality and the historical payment of a final dividend to our shareholders while we were a listed company on the London Stock Exchange, our cash low point has historically been in May or June. We did not have to draw down on our then-outstanding revolving credit facility under the Refinanced Senior Facilities in the 2019, 2018 or 2017 financial years. In connection with the Acquisition, we redeemed the aggregate principal amount outstanding of our then-outstanding 2[3]⁄4% senior notes due 2022 and we repaid amounts outstanding under, and cancelled commitments in respect of, our then-outstanding revolving credit facility under the Refinanced Senior 101 ----- Facilities. As a result, our primary debt service obligations and those of our parent entities consisted primarily of interest payments on the Existing Senior Notes, the Existing 2026 Notes and borrowings under the Senior Facilities. As at 28 December 2019, MEL had £160 million of cash and cash equivalents and, under our Senior Facilities, among other facilities, a Revolving Facility in the amount of £400 million, of which £nil million was drawn down and a Delayed Draw Term Loan in the amount of $172.5 million, of which £nil million was drawn down. As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Revolving Facility and the Delayed Draw Term Loan were fully cash drawn in the amount of £370 million and $172.5 million, respectively. The remaining £30 million committed under the Revolving Facility is available to be drawn by way of establishing certain ancillary facilities, including letters of credit. MAL and its consolidated subsidiaries had cash and cash equivalents of £520 million as at 28 March 2020, including the impact of full utilisation under the Revolving Facility and the Delayed Draw Term Loan, of which approximately £24 million was granted by the local government towards the funding of LEGOLAND Korea. Giving effect to the Offering, MAL and its consolidated subsidiaries would have had cash and cash equivalents of £865 million as at 28 March 2020, of which approximately £24 million would have been granted by the local government towards the funding of LEGOLAND Korea.

Net cash from operating activities primarily reflects our EBITDA, as well as working capital movements, changes in provisions and other non-current liabilities and tax paid. Net cash from operating activities in the 2019 financial year amounted to a net cash inflow of £460 million, a decrease of £72 million, or 14 per cent., from a net cash inflow of £532 million in the 2018 financial year, on a restated basis. The decrease was mainly attributable to exceptional costs incurred. Net cash from operating activities in the 2018 financial year, as originally reported, amounted to a net cash inflow of £450 million, an increase of £37 million, or 9 per cent., from a net cash inflow of £413 million in the 2017 financial year. The increase was primarily attributable to increased EBITDA and lower cash tax payments. _Net Cash Outflow from Investing Activities_ Net cash outflow from investing activities primarily includes cash used for payments to acquire businesses, net of cash acquired, capital expenditure in our Existing Estate and investment in new Midway Attractions, new LEGOLAND Parks and new accommodation offerings, net of cash received from proceeds on the disposal of property, plant and equipment and interest received. Net cash outflow from investing activities in the 2019 financial year amounted to a net cash outflow of £237 million, a decrease of £80 million, or 25 per cent., from a net cash outflow of £317 million in the 2018 102 ----- financial year, on a restated basis. The decrease was primarily attributable to inflows relating to the disposal of our Australian ski resorts and the receipt of the final tranche of LEGOLAND Korea grant monies, offset by an increase in capital expenditure investment on our Existing Estate Attractions and on New Business Development. Net cash outflow from investing activities in the 2018 financial year, as originally reported, amounted to a net cash outflow of £317 million, a decrease of £26 million, or 8 per cent., from a net cash outflow of £343 million in the 2017 financial year. The decrease was primarily attributable to local government support through direct funding for LEGOLAND Korea and a decrease in Existing Estate capital expenditure, partially offset by increased capital expenditure on New Business Development and the roll-out of new Midway Attractions. _Net Cash Outflow from Financing Activities_ Net cash outflow from financing activities primarily includes any form of long-term debt financing raised or repaid, interest paid, cash used for payments to acquire available-for-sale financial assets and dividends paid. Net cash outflow from financing activities in the 2019 financial year amounted to a net cash outflow of £166 million, a decrease of £251 million, from a net cash outflow of £417 million in the 2018 financial year, on a restated basis. The decrease was primarily attributable to the impact of a refinancing completed in the 2018 financial year and the impact of the Acquisition in the 2019 financial year. Net cash outflow from financing activities in the 2018 financial year, as originally reported, amounted to a net cash outflow of £335 million, a decrease of £355 million, from a net cash inflow of £20 million in the 2017 financial year. The decrease was primarily attributable to the successful refinancing of a significant portion of our debt facilities. The issuance of the Existing 2026 Notes, upsizing our then-outstanding revolving credit facility under the Refinanced Senior Facilities to £600 million from £300 million and utilising surplus cash on the balance sheet enabled us to repay term loans which were due to mature in March 2020, and additional surplus cash enabled us to subsequently pay down this revolving credit facility.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

Existing Estate capital expenditure was £159 million, £144 million and £163 million for the 2017, 2018 and 2019 financial years, respectively. Our capital expenditure was £163 million and £216 million for the Existing Estate and New Business Development, respectively, for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019. New Business Development investment represented £40 million in respect of developing new accommodation across our theme park estate, £41 million in respect of new Midway Attractions that either opened in 2019 or will open in 2020, and £135 million in respect of longer term investments of developing new LEGOLAND parks, specifically LEGOLAND New York and LEGOLAND Korea. We continuously plan expenditure for the development of our estate, both in respect of (i) upgrading and refreshing our Existing Estate and (ii) new business. Our capital expenditure relating to the development of new business is primarily focused on the roll-out of Attractions into new locations and countries, including the development of ‘‘second gates,’’ up-selling our existing Theme Parks and new accommodation offerings and transforming our Theme Parks into short break destinations. Our new business capital expenditure is principally in respect of the development of new sites but can also be in respect of acquired sites. During the 2017, 2018 and 2019 financial years, we invested an average of 9.3 per cent. of our total revenue each financial year in capital expenditure relating to the development of our Existing Estate. Existing Estate capital expenditure typically includes (i) adding new rides and Attractions, (ii) replacing old features with new, more up to date ones and (iii) general maintenance and refurbishment of existing Attractions (including ensuring health and safety standards are met or exceeded). Such investments are intended to maintain or improve product appeal and guest experience, which is key to increasing visitor attendance levels and length of stay, and support increases in admission fees (above inflation) and commercial spend. We typically benefit from increased visitor numbers and revenue from an Attraction in the year of opening a new ride or other significant product investment at the site.

In 2019, major investments have included the re-launch of the iconic Colossos roller coaster at Heide-Park Resort while LEGOLAND Florida has seen the first of our ‘‘LEGO Movie World’’ investments. At SEA LIFE Sydney Aquarium, visitors can experience the world’s largest Great Barrier Reef exhibit in the interactive ‘Day and Night on the Reef’. We initially targeted an opening in 2020 for LEGOLAND New York and, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are now targeting an opening in 2021. This is a complex project and we now expect to spend approximately £340 million, of which approximately £190 million had been spent as at 28 March 2020. At the start of 2019, we also announced that an agreement had been reached with Gangwon Provincial Government with respect of partial funding for LEGOLAND Korea, which will be an owned and operated resort, targeted to open by 2022. We intend to invest approximately £190 million in LEGOLAND Korea, of which funding of approximately £135 million will be provided by us and approximately £55 million will come from LL Developments, the investment arm of Gangwon Province. Of this £55 million, approximately £14 million was received by 29 June 2019 and the balance was received in July 2019. Additionally, the funding for necessary additional infrastructure adjacent to LEGOLAND Korea will be provided by national, regional and local governments. The Korean Government Gangwon Province and Chuncheon City have already invested in the construction of the new bridge to Hajungdo Island where LEGOLAND Korea will be located and undertaken groundworks on the site. Accommodation continues to drive improved levels of guest satisfaction and increases in pre-bookings. In the 2019 financial year, accommodation revenue represented 22 per cent. of revenue across our theme park operating groups compared to 13 per cent. in 2013. During the 2019 financial year, we opened 372 rooms, including the 128-room Magic Hotel at Gardaland Resort, 102 ‘‘stargazing pods’’ at Alton Towers Resort and the Castle Hotel at LEGOLAND Billund. Our capital expenditure in the 2018 financial year of £327 million, on a restated basis, was allocated to the development of LEGOLAND New York, to new accommodations at certain LEGOLAND Parks and Resort Theme Parks and other investments, such as LEGOLAND Discovery Centre Birmingham, SEA LIFE Centre Japan, Peppa Pig Lands at Gardaland and Heide-Park Resorts, Little BIG City Beijing, LEGOLAND Discovery Centre Columbus, Bear Grylls Adventure in Birmingham, Peppa Pig World of Play in Shanghai and the Shanghai Dungeon.

In addition, the LCA requires us to develop the LEGOLAND business and the extension of the term of the LCA on an exclusive basis is subject to the development of a certain number of LEGOLAND Parks or LEGOLAND Discovery Centres. See ‘‘Business—Material Contracts—Intellectual Property’’ and ‘‘Risk _Factors—Risks Related to Our Market and Our Business—Our use of the LEGOLAND and LEGO trademarks, content and other intellectual property rights are subject to the terms and conditions of the LCA.’’_ As at 28 December 2019, we have a number of outstanding capital commitments in respect of capital expenditure at our Existing Estate (including accommodation), as well as for Midway Attractions and LEGOLAND Parks that are under construction and for which major construction contracts are already in place (such as contracts relating to LEGOLAND New York). These commitments are expected to be settled within two financial years of the reporting date and amounted to £220 million as at 28 December 2019 (£142 million as at 29 December 2018) for which no provision has been made. We initially targeted an opening in 2020 for LEGOLAND New York and, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are now targeting an opening in 2021. This is a complex project and we now expect to spend approximately £340 million, of which approximately £190 million had been spent as at 28 March 2020. At the start of 2019, we also announced that an agreement had been reached with Gangwon Provincial Government with respect of partial funding for LEGOLAND Korea, which will be an owned and operated 105 ----- resort, targeted to open by 2022. We intend to invest approximately £190 million in LEGOLAND Korea, of which funding of approximately £135 million will be provided by us and approximately £55 million will come from LL Developments, the investment arm of Gangwon Province. Of this £55 million, approximately £14 million was received by 29 June 2019 and the balance was received in July 2019. Additionally, the funding for necessary additional infrastructure adjacent to LEGOLAND Korea will be provided by national, regional and local governments. The Korean Government Gangwon Province and Chuncheon City have already invested in the construction of the new bridge to Hajungdo Island where LEGOLAND Korea will be located and undertaken groundworks on the site. In September 2019, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to partner in the development of LEGOLAND Sichuan and operate it under a management contract arrangement, with the resort scheduled to open by the end of 2023. In addition, in November 2019, we entered into an agreement with the Shanghai Jinshan District Government, CMC Inc. and KIRKBI to develop a LEGOLAND resort in the Jinshan District of Shanghai to open after 2023. Under the terms of the agreement, all parties will form a joint venture company and contribute funding to the construction and development of LEGOLAND Shanghai.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

The Tussauds Group scheme entitles retired employees to receive an annual payment based on a percentage of final salary for each year of service that the employee provided. The entitlement of the retired employees under the Gardaland scheme is dependent on the state laws in place at the date employment commenced and is subject to a certain minimum period of service. The total expense relating to our defined contribution pension schemes in the 2019 financial year was £13 million (2018: £12 million). For further information with respect to the expenses relating to the defined contribution schemes and the assets and liabilities in respect of the defined benefit schemes, see note 5.2 to the audited consolidated financial statements for the 2019 financial year, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. As with all employers in the United Kingdom, we enrol all eligible U.K. jobholders (which includes all employees aged between 22 and the state pension age who earn over £10,000 in the tax year 2016 - 2017) into a defined contribution pension scheme automatically (a process known as auto enrolment). Auto enrolment requires us to make contributions to each participating jobholder’s defined contribution pension (based on ‘‘qualifying earnings’’ (as defined below)) with effect from our staging date, which was 26 November 2013. We have adopted the qualifying earnings (‘‘QE’’) basis of contributions. Qualifying earnings (for the purposes of the 2018 - 2019 tax year) are earnings between £6,032 and £46,350. Compulsory employer contributions amount to 3 per cent. of a participating employee’s QE as at 6 April 2019. However, we also allow eligible U.K. employees, depending on grade entitlement, to increase their contributions based on basic salary, in which case our matching employer contributions are based on the relevant employees’ entire basic salaries rather than QE.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

Our potential currency exposures comprise transaction and translation exposures. We aim to ensure that net exposure to foreign currency balances is kept to a minimal level by using foreign currency swaps to exchange balances back into sterling or by buying and selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts is the present value of future cash flows and is determined by reference to market rates. At 28 December 2019 the fair value of foreign currency swap assets was £2 million and the foreign currency swap liabilities was £2 million, none of which are hedge accounted. _Transaction Exposures_ Our revenue and costs of operations are denominated primarily in the currencies of the relevant local territories. Any significant cross-border trading exposures are hedged by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts. _Translation Exposures_ Our results, as presented in sterling, are subject to fluctuations as a result of exchange rate movements. We do not hedge this translation exposure to our earnings but, where material, may carry out net asset hedging by borrowing in the same currencies as the currencies of our operating units or by using forward foreign exchange contracts. Gains or losses arise on the retranslation of the net assets of foreign operations at different reporting dates and are recognised within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. They will predominantly relate to the retranslation of opening net assets at closing foreign exchange rates, together with the retranslation of retained foreign profits for the year (that have been accounted for in the consolidated income statement at average rates) at closing rates. Gains or losses also arise on the retranslation of foreign currency denominated borrowings designated as effective net investment hedges of overseas net assets. These are offset in equity by corresponding gains or losses arising on the retranslation of the related hedged foreign currency net assets. We also treat specific intercompany loan balances, which are not intended to be repaid in the foreseeable future, as part of our net investment. In the event of a foreign entity being sold or a hedging item being extinguished, such exchange differences would be recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. _Sensitivity Analysis on Foreign Currency Risk_ Gains or losses in the income statement and equity are offset by the retranslation of the related foreign currency net assets or specific intercompany loan balances. As at 28 December 2019, a 10 per cent. strengthening of all currencies against sterling would increase net debt by £313 million (2018 financial year: £111 million). For the financial year ended 28 December 2019, a 10 per cent. strengthening of all currencies against sterling would reduce the fair value of foreign exchange contracts and result in a charge to the income statement of £9 million (2018 financial year: £9 million).",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

We are subject to credit risk in respect of trade counterparties, such as tour companies and other businesses that sell tickets as part of a package offering, which represents a smaller proportion of our business, and larger function bookings. We manage our credit risk by implementing policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential trade counterparties before sales commence and dealing with creditworthy counterparties. Credit evaluations are performed on customers requiring credit over a certain amount. We manage and monitor the credit rating of our counterparty exposures including any exposure arising from bank deposits, cash held at bank 107 ----- and derivative transactions. Our group treasury will only place funds and transact derivatives with banks with a minimum investment grade credit rating of Baa3 or BBB� (from Moody’s or Standard and Poors, respectively) or better. In practice, however, we deposit the majority of our cash with banks or money funds with an investment grade credit rating of A�/A3 or better. We do not believe we have any material concentrations of credit risk, as its exposure is spread over a large number of customers and counterparties. Some Attractions maintain local bank accounts with banks which have lower credit ratings than Baa3 or BBB�. In these circumstances, the Attractions are subject to tight limits as to the cash balances they may hold with those banks.

Our policy on liquidity risk is to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping a minimum specific amount of liquid resources available. We produce short-term and long-term cash forecasts to identify our liquidity requirements and we manage our exposure to liquidity risk through maintaining a diversity of funding resources including cash and committed bank facilities. Surplus cash is actively managed across our bank accounts to cover local shortfalls or invested in bank deposits or liquidity funds in-line with our policies on counterparty exposure. In some jurisdictions bank cash pooling arrangements are in place to optimise the use of cash. As at 28 December 2019, we had £160 million of cash and cash equivalents and, under our Senior Facilities, among other facilities, a Revolving Facility in the amount of £400 million, of which £nil million was drawn down and a Delayed Draw Term Loan in the amount of $172.5 million, of which £nil million was drawn down.

187,Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.44,Disclosure about Market and Credit Risks,17.44.5,Critical Accounting Policies,"Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying our accounting policies. It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider the following policies to be the most significant policies that require management to make subjective and complex judgements or to consider matters that are inherently uncertain, which may cause actual results to differ from the estimated and assumptions we use in applying the critical accounting policies described below. _Investments in subsidiaries_ Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, less provision for impairment. The carrying amount of our investments in subsidiaries is reviewed annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the investment’s recoverable amount is estimated. If the carrying value of the investment exceeds the recoverable amount, the investment is considered to be impaired and is written down to the recoverable amount. The impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. _Foreign currency_ Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement. 108 ----- _Taxation_ Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to items recognised directly in equity, when it is recognised directly in equity, or when it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income, when it is recognised through the statement of comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods. Deferred tax is provided on certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and taxation purposes respectively. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period. After considering forecast future profits, deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those assets can be utilised. _Share-based payments_ The fair value of equity-settled share-based payments was recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value was measured at grant date and charged as the employees become unconditionally entitled to the rights. Our equity-settled share plans were settled either by the issue of shares by Merlin or by the purchase of shares in the market. These share plans all vested at the time of the Acquisition when we de-listed from the London Stock Exchange. The fair value of the share plans was recognised as an expense over the expected vesting period net of deferred tax with a corresponding entry to retained earnings. The fair value of the share plans was determined at the date of grant. Non-market based vesting conditions (i.e., earnings per share and return on capital employed targets) were taken into account in estimating the number of awards likely to vest. The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest was reviewed at each accounting date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate was adjusted to reflect the actual awards issued. No adjustment was made after the vesting date even if the awards were forfeited or were not exercised. We operated cash-settled versions of the employee incentive schemes for employees in certain territories. The issues and resulting charges of these schemes were not material to the financial statements. _Loans to Group undertakings_ Loans to Group undertakings are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment. _Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group_ Financial instruments are recognised on the statement of financial position when we become party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The accounting policy for each type of financial instrument is included within the relevant note. Financial assets are initially measured at fair value, unless otherwise noted, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss. A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or we transfer the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, plus, in the case of other financial liabilities, directly attributable transaction costs. Other financial liabilities, primarily our interest-bearing loans and borrowings, are measured at amortised cost. Financial liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss and are held on the statement of financial position at fair value. A financial liability is derecognised 109 ----- when our obligations are discharged, expire or are cancelled. Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance costs. An equity instrument is any contract that has a residual interest in our assets after deducting all of our liabilities. Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity. Where financial instruments consist of a combination of debt and equity, we will assess the substance of the arrangement in place and decide how to attribute values to each taking into consideration the policy definitions above. _Interest-bearing loans and borrowings_ These are initially recognised at the principal value of the loan concerned, less any related fees. These fees are then amortised through the income statement on an effective interest rate basis over the expected life of the loan (or over the contractual term where there is no clear indication that a shorter life is appropriate). If our estimate of the expected life based on repayment subsequently changes, the resulting adjustment to the effective interest rate calculation is recognised as a gain or loss on re-measurement and presented separately in the income statement. _Dividends_ Dividends are recognised through equity on the earlier of their approval by our shareholders or their payment. 110 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

As at 28 December 2019, we operated 130 Attractions in 25 countries across four continents, and in the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019, we welcomed approximately 67 million visitors to our Attractions. We are the largest operator of visitor attractions and theme parks in Europe and the second largest operator globally, in each case, by number of visitors in 2018. We are also a market leader in the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy by total visitor numbers, with an already significant and growing presence in the United States and the Asia-Pacific region. We believe we own and/or operate a unique portfolio of chainable iconic assets and brands, each possessing a strong heritage within its original markets, as well as being globally scalable and supported by our extensive technical and creative expertise. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments globally (including within the markets in which we operate) have implemented strict social distancing measures, including varying degrees of lockdowns and closures of non-essential businesses, including ours. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented disruption to our business, and the wide variations in potential outcomes present a material challenge to our business and our industry. We took action early in response to the crisis as COVID-19 was emerging in Asia and we continue to take every step that we believe is prudent to protect and manage the business, reduce our cost base and protect our operating cash flows. See ‘‘—Recent Developments—Impact of _Coronavirus (COVID-19).’’ As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, it is not possible to accurately_ predict the medium- or long-term impact of COVID-19 on our business and our industry. Since our establishment in 1999, our strategic vision continues to be the creation of a high growth, high return, family entertainment business, naturally balanced against the pressures of the macroeconomic environment in which we operate. Our portfolio of assets and brands is highly diversified across geography, attraction type, brand and customer demographic and our globally diversified portfolio is well-balanced between indoor and outdoor Attractions and international and domestic visitation (with international and domestic visitation measured relative to the relevant Attraction). We believe our footprint across 25 countries provides us with a favourable platform to benefit from the normalised global growth trend in spending on travel and tourism, by allowing us to attract both international tourists and domestic visitors, and providing us with a buffer in the event of macroeconomic and currency risks. Our operating groups offer our visitors diverse entertainment options, including both indoor Attractions within city centres as well as outdoor theme parks offering multi-day visits. We estimate that in 2018, 72 per cent. of visitors to our Attractions were domestic visitors and 28 per cent. were international tourists, based on a survey of a sample of our visitors. In the 2019 financial year, 39 per cent. of our revenue was derived from our LEGOLAND Parks and 22 per cent. of our revenue was derived from our Resort Theme Parks operations, which are primarily organised around outdoor activities, and 39 per cent. of our revenue was derived from our Midway Attractions operating group, which is primarily organised around indoor activities, providing a natural hedge against weather disruptions. We have established a diverse portfolio of nationally and internationally recognised premium brands focused on delivering memorable experiences to millions of visitors around the world. We generated revenue of £1,740 million, Underlying EBITDA from continuing operations of £569 million, profit before tax of £133 million and underlying profit before tax of £234 million for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019. We generated Normalised EBITDA of £484 million and pro forma EBITDA of £492 million, in each case for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019 and disapplying IFRS 16 and excluding from our results of the results of discontinued operations.

Examples include Madame Tussauds, SEA LIFE and the London Eye in our Midway Attractions operating group, LEGOLAND California and LEGOLAND Windsor in our LEGOLAND Parks operating group and Gardaland Resort and Alton Towers Resort in our Resort Theme Parks operating group. We believe the strength and breadth of our iconic brand portfolio enable us to offer compelling entertainment propositions through a wide variety of activities and visitor experiences across a broad range of geographies and all key target demographic groups ranging from families with young children, teenagers, young adults to older adults. Our LEGOLAND Parks also benefit from a mutually synergistic relationship with the LEGO Group. Our portfolio is focused on delivering high-quality family entertainment, with the LEGOLAND Parks and LEGOLAND Discovery Centres in particular placing an emphasis on ‘‘playful learning.’’ Our portfolio of brands enables us to differentiate our Parks and Attractions from unbranded operators and to attract visitors to our Attractions. 113 ----- _Midway Attractions_ Our Midway Attractions benefit from high-quality, chainable brands with broad international appeal and recognition, which are distributed across geographies, markets and target demographics, creating a diversified portfolio. We believe the strength of our brands allows us to maximise economies of scale and synergies.

In 2018, we opened seven new Midway Attractions, which included Little BIG City Beijing, our second Attraction under that format, the first Dungeon Attraction in Asia in Shanghai, and pilots of two new intellectual property partnerships, The Bear Grylls Adventure in the U.K. and Peppa Pig World of Play in Shanghai. In 2019, we opened eight new Midway Attractions, which comprised the Alton Towers Dungeon, LEGOLAND Discovery Centres in each of Beijing, San Antonio and Shenyang, SEA LIFE Attractions in Malaysia and Shenyang and Peppa Pig World of Play in Dallas and Michigan. Other Attractions include two Treetop Walk experiences in Victoria and New South Wales, Australia, which we acquired as part of the Living and Leisure Australia acquisition in February 2012, one WILD LIFE Australian animal adventure Attractions in Sydney, ‘‘DreamWorks Tours’ Shrek’s Adventure!’’ Midway Attraction in London and two ‘‘Little BIG City’’ Midway Attractions in Berlin and Beijing. Our scale and portfolio of strong brands has allowed us to leverage a number of strategic synergies. We have developed ‘‘clusters’’ of Midway Attractions in Amsterdam, Arizona, Bangkok, Berlin, Blackpool, Dallas, Istanbul, Kansas City, London, Manchester, Melbourne, Michigan, Oberhausen, Orlando, San Francisco, Shanghai, Sydney and Tokyo, where multiple Attractions are situated in one city or region to capitalise on strong cross promotional and operational synergies, including multi-attraction tickets to drive cross-selling. _LEGOLAND Resorts and Parks_ The LEGO brand is globally recognised and is associated with fun and learning through play. We hold the global, exclusive license to own and operate LEGOLAND Parks until at least 2054. We own and/or operate LEGOLAND Parks in Denmark, Germany, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, Dubai, California, Florida and Japan, all of which build on the strength of the LEGO brand and are themed and interactive parks, which are designed to appeal to families (particularly with children aged two to twelve years) looking for a fun and engaging day out. We have expanded our LEGOLAND offering in recent years with the opening of LEGOLAND Florida in 2011, LEGOLAND Malaysia in 2012, LEGOLAND Dubai in the United Arab Emirates in 2016 and LEGOLAND Japan in 2017. We operate the parks in Malaysia and Dubai under management contracts. LEGOLAND Japan is ‘‘leased and operated,’’ meaning a third-party partner (a subsidiary of KIRKBI) funded the acquisition of the park site, the development of the infrastructure and the basic construction while we funded and built the rides, provided the necessary theming and built the on-site SEA LIFE Centre second gate and the on-site accommodation. We lease the site on a long-term basis and operate the 114 ----- park. In 2017, we announced the development of a LEGOLAND park in New York State with a targeted opening in 2020, which is being developed under an ‘‘owned and operated’’ model. We are now targeting a 2021 opening. At the start of 2019, we also announced that an agreement had been reached with Gangwon Provincial Government with respect of partial funding for LEGOLAND Korea, which will be an owned and operated resort, targeted to open by 2022. We intend to invest approximately £190 million in LEGOLAND Korea, of which funding of approximately £135 million will be provided by us and approximately £55 million will come from LL Developments, the investment arm of Gangwon Province. Of this £55 million, approximately £14 million was received by 29 June 2019 and the balance was received in July 2019. This site is also being developed under an ‘‘owned and operated’’ model. We have also identified sites for potential LEGOLAND Parks in the medium and long-term and maintain ongoing dialogue with a number of potential partners to develop several LEGOLAND parks in China with a focus on operating these parks under management contracts. In September 2019, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to partner in the development of LEGOLAND Sichuan and operate it under a management contract arrangement, with the resort scheduled to open by the end of 2023. In addition, in November 2019, we entered into an agreement with the Shanghai Jinshan District Government, CMC Inc. and KIRKBI to develop a LEGOLAND resort in the Jinshan District of Shanghai to open after 2023. All of our open LEGOLAND Parks, with the exception of LEGOLAND Dubai where we anticipate opening a hotel, have themed on-site hotels ranging from 61 to 263 rooms. During the 2019 financial year, we opened 372 rooms, including a 142-room Castle Hotel at LEGOLAND Billund Resort. We opened 644 new rooms in 2018, including a 252-room hotel at LEGOLAND Japan, transforming the park, which opened in 2017, into a resort. Adding on-site, themed accommodation has historically improved guest satisfaction, increased the catchment area for our parks, increased the level of pre-booked revenue and improved cross-selling opportunities. For example, we opened 142-rooms at the Pirate Island Hotel at LEGOLAND Deutschland in 2018, during which year we had a guest satisfaction score of 97 per cent. and occupancy of up to 95 per cent. We also have plans for additional accommodation at our other parks in future years. We believe these hotels and villages provide an integral contribution to the overall customer experience and help drive increases in multi-day ticket sales. _Resort Theme Parks_ Each of our six Resort Theme Parks is a national brand aimed at families, teenagers and young adults, with themed accommodation at all locations. For example, THORPE PARK Resort focuses especially on the teen and young adult markets whereas Chessington World of Adventures Resort is orientated more towards families. Each of our Resort Theme Parks, certain of which are among the leading theme parks in the U.K., Italy and Northern Germany, enjoys high brand and customer awareness in its local market. We believe that each of our Resort Theme Parks offers a compelling, coherent proposition and strong theming, with few or no local competitors that can offer the same quality or scale of visitor experience. We aim to implement effective marketing and promotions to ensure that each brand is the strongest in its relevant market. Our Resort Theme Parks are recognised as destination resorts, attracting short break visits from national and, in certain cases, international visitors, supported by short break marketing campaigns. Each of our Resort Theme Parks has one or more hotels or holiday villages. We opened a 76-room CBeebies Land Hotel and 102 ‘‘stargazing pods’’ at Alton Towers Resort in 2017 and 2019, respectively. In 2019, we also opened a Magic Hotel at Gardaland Resort and announced the intended opening of a LEGOLAND Waterpark at Gardaland Resort. Each of our Resort Theme Parks is strongly positioned in its national/regional market, often representing the pre-eminent visitor attraction in its respective region and benefiting from being situated in a prominent location with good transport links to areas of substantial populations. In particular, we have a market leading position in the United Kingdom, where we own the top four theme parks, as classified by the Themed Entertainment Association, by number of visitors in 2018: LEGOLAND Windsor (part of our LEGOLAND Parks operating group), Alton Towers Resort, THORPE PARK Resort and Chessington World of Adventures Resort. We also hold strong market positions in Italy and Germany, in each case by number of visitors in 2019. The scale of our Resort Theme Parks and available undeveloped land at certain locations has also provided opportunities for ‘‘second gates,’’ which are visitor attractions at an existing resort with a separate entrance and for which additional admission fees are charged. For example, there is a SEA LIFE centre located close to Gardaland Resort and a Dungeons Warwick Castle on the Warwick Castle site. 115 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

The main factors underpinning sector trends are the increasing leisure time in both developed and emerging economies, the value placed on time spent together with friends and family and growing tourism to gateway cities. According to the World Travel & Tourism Council (the ‘‘WTTC’’) in a publication released prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, spending in the global leisure market was forecast to increase by 3.9 per cent. per annum from $4.65 trillion to $6.78 trillion between 2019 and 2029, respectively, which reflects faster growth than that of the broader economy. In 2018, international tourist arrivals totalled 1.4 billion, representing the second strongest year since 2010. Tourist arrivals grew by 6 per cent. in 2018, which was the ninth consecutive year of sustained growth, according to the UN World Tourism Organisation (the ‘‘UNWTO’’). Despite certain external events (including geopolitical incidents and acts of terrorism), the international travel industry has grown consistently over this period. According to the UNWTO, international tourism has grown at a CAGR of 3.8 per cent. from 2007 to 2017. It is not at this time possible to predict what long-term impact, if any, the COVID-19 pandemic will have on these trends. Significant growth in international tourism has historically had a positive impact on certain of our Attractions, including those in London, New York, Shanghai, Tokyo and Hong Kong, which have also benefitted from a growing trend of short break holidays by domestic travellers to key getaway cities. Short breaks in the U.K. have grown at a CAGR of 5.0 per cent. from 2.8 million holiday breaks in 1996 to 7.4 million in 2016 resulting in an increasing number of people taking ‘‘staycations.’’ Furthermore, the relatively lower cost of short breaks or ‘‘staycations’’ has historically provided a buffer when we are faced with more challenging economic conditions as individuals forego destination holidays in favour of entertainment closer to home. Subject to the impact of the disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe we are well-positioned to meet this demand for short-term accommodation through our growing offering of themed, on-site accommodation and second gate Attractions aimed at extending the duration of our visitors’ stay. In the 2019 financial year, accommodation revenue represented 22 per cent. of revenue across our theme park operating groups compared to 13 per cent. in 2013. Accommodation not only continues to increase the duration of our visitors’ stay, allowing greater cross-selling opportunities and driving improved levels of guest satisfaction, but also leads to increases in pre-bookings, revenue visibility and positive working capital.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

These partnerships provide us with additional means to deliver memorable experiences to visitors of our Attractions and we offer our partners opportunities to increase engagement with their customers. For example, we have multiple intellectual property agreements ranging in scale from local level relationships for specific Attractions, to global, multi-product relationships with some exclusivity, to our core global, multi-product and exclusive relationship with the LEGO Group. We hold the global, exclusive rights to the LEGOLAND brand under the licencing and co-operation agreement signed with KIRKBI A/S. We have a synergistic relationship with the LEGO Group and KIRKBI A/S, which is a 75 per cent. shareholder of the LEGO Group with a 100 per cent. ownership of the LEGO and LEGOLAND trademarks and a 50 per cent. shareholder of our Group. We have also established and continue to develop, global, regional and local intellectual property partnerships allowing us to use brands such as Ghostbusters, the Gruffalo, Shrek, Kung Fu Panda and CBeebies, the latter through our partnership with BBC Worldwide. We continue to develop new global intellectual property partnerships and in 2018, we opened a Bear Grylls Adventure Attraction in the United Kingdom and a Peppa Pig Attraction in China.

Each of our operating groups commands a strong market share within its market and benefits from competitive advantages. Our ongoing product investment and innovation, and strong focus on creating memorable experiences for our guests, have resulted in continued strong levels of guest satisfaction. In 2019, we delivered an overall guest satisfaction score across our group of 94 per cent. and a ‘‘Net Promoter’’ score of 56 per cent., which measures the propensity for our guests to recommend 116 ----- our Attractions and which increased compared to 2017. We consider a Net Promoter score of 50 per cent. or more to be ‘‘world class.’’ Our ‘‘Net Promoter’’ score was 47, 50, 53, 55, 55 and 57 for the 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 financial years, respectively. We believe that the strong market position and breadth of the operations of our Resort Theme Parks, LEGOLAND Parks and Midway Attractions are also supported by our historic investment in each category. In particular, our existing portfolio of strong brands and use of the LEGO brand offer a compelling proposition that distinguishes our business. In each of our three operating groups, we benefit from in-house technical and creative capacity, well-located sites in attractive markets, permits and branding relationships. We also retain a number of competitive advantages in the Midway Attractions operating group. These advantages include strong brand recognition in connection with our existing brands such as Madame Tussauds, SEA LIFE, the Eye and LEGOLAND/LEGO, our own in-house Merlin Magic Making team which includes wax sculptors, our SEA LIFE marine biologists and our ability to operate our Midway Attractions as part of ‘‘clusters,’’ where multiple Attractions are situated in one city or region to capitalise on cross-selling, including through our multi-attraction pass opportunities. We have been able to capitalise on our marketing leverage through ticketing promotions with partners such as Kellogg’s and Tesco, amongst others. A popular package amongst customers is the sale of annual passes, which are purchased online or at our parks for a one-off price that enables customers to visit all Attractions within a particular country for one year for no additional admission fee.

This diversification helps us deliver strong financial results across a variety of different market conditions and to minimise the impact of external factors, such as regional economic performance, extreme weather and other external factors. We operate in 25 countries globally, including 15 countries in Europe and North America and ten countries in the Asia-Pacific region, drawing both domestic and international visitors in each location. In the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019, the United Kingdom, Europe (excluding the United Kingdom), North America and the Asia-Pacific region accounted for 32 per cent., 25 per cent., 27 per cent. and 16 per cent. of our revenue, respectively. These results reflect increased diversification of revenue sources since the 2011 financial year, during which the United Kingdom and Europe (excluding the United Kingdom) accounted for 43 per cent. and 34 per cent. of reported revenues, respectively, while North America accounted for only 16 per cent. of reported revenues and the Asia-Pacific region accounted for only 7 per cent. of reported revenues. Our long-term ambition is for a relatively equal split of revenue across Europe (including the United Kingdom), North America and the Asia-Pacific region. Our business is not reliant upon the ‘‘fly-in’’ market of international tourism. We estimate that in 2018, 72 per cent. of visitors to our Attractions were domestic visitors and 28 per cent. were international tourists, based on a survey of a sample of our visitors. Domestic visitors enhance the resilience of the underlying business as relatively low-cost local tourism is preferred in a soft macroeconomic environment. Our Attractions range in format from city centre to destination resorts and coastal Attractions, capturing both the urban and resort-based tourist market and appealing to visitors ranging from families with young children to teenagers and adults. Our Attractions are also partially insulated against extreme weather or seasonal changes through a mixture of formats, with 39 per cent. of our revenue having been derived from our LEGOLAND Parks and 22 per cent. of our revenue having been derived from our Resort Theme Parks operations, both of which are primarily organised around outdoor activities, and 39 per cent. of our revenue having been derived from our Midway Attractions operating group, which is primarily organised around indoor activities, in the 2019 financial year. Most of our Attractions are open year-round, other than our European Theme Parks, which tend to be closed during the winter. In 2018, 62 per cent. of our revenue (excluding the impact of IFRS 15) came from sites that are open all year-round. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had been experiencing increasing pre-booked revenues, leading to reduced volatility in Attraction revenues. In the 2018 financial year, 62 per cent. of total admissions revenue (excluding the impact of IFRS 15) were generated from pre-bookings or annual passes, also 117 ----- resulting in a positive financial contribution to working capital.

We have a flexible cost base, with an ability to effectively increase and decrease the number of employee hours and scheduling of shifts at our Attractions depending on customer demand levels.

See ‘‘Presentation of Financial Information—Non-IFRS Financial _Information.’’ Further, our own in-house Merlin Magic Making team delivers innovative new product ideas_ including ride concept and design, wax figure manufacture, animal and fish husbandry, and therefore yields synergies and cost-savings over third-parties that would otherwise be engaged to develop our Attractions. We also maximise our marketing spend through targeted campaigns focused on educating prospective customers about new Attractions and rides. Throughout this process, we take advantage of our market leverage and implement cost-efficiencies such as shared marketing costs, central management, site development expertise and application of visitor management experiences across the portfolio. In addition to the benefits we derive from our core competencies, we maintain our estate through regular planned maintenance capital expenditure, which means that incremental capital expenditure can be targeted at driving incremental revenue opportunities. LEGOLAND Parks typically require lower capital expenditure than our Resort Theme Parks because they are geared towards families with young children and do not require expensive, large format roller coasters. Our Resort Theme Parks tend to be nationally pre-eminent in their respective markets and therefore lack the significant competitive intensity of the theme park operators in the United States. As a result, we do not need to compete solely on the basis of the latest and largest coasters but can open significant new coasters on an opportunistic basis. In addition, although not directly comparable to other theme park operators, the Midway Attractions operating group does not require substantial ongoing capital expenditure due to the lack of large scale coasters, or rides, and the low overall degree of capital employed in each site. Capital expenditure programmes for the Midway Attractions operating group vary between Attractions, depending on the size and anticipated growth of the Attraction. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion _and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital Expenditure.’’_ Capital expenditure across our portfolio of Attractions is primarily funded out of our operating free cash flow. Our total reported capital expenditure for the 2019 financial year was £379 million, of which £40 million was used for the development of new accommodations, £41 million was used for the development of Midway Attractions, £135 million was used for the longer term development of new LEGOLAND parks, specifically LEGOLAND New York and LEGOLAND Korea, and £163 million was used for our Existing Estate. Our Existing Estate capital expenditure was 10 per cent., 9 per cent. and 9 per cent. of revenue in the 2017, 2018 and 2019 financial years, respectively. Our successful and flexible capital expenditure programme has translated into consistently positive cash conversion with cash conversion of 66.5 per cent., 74.6 per cent. and 71.5 per cent. in the 2017, 2018 and 2019 financial years, respectively. 22APR202017591988 Source: Company information.

See ‘‘Management.’’ Our Chief Executive Officer, Nick Varney, has led Merlin since our inception in 1999. The senior management team has driven the development and execution of our strategy to deliver growth both organically and through acquisitions. Our senior management team is supported by local management teams, which run our operating groups and Attractions. Each Resort Theme Park, LEGOLAND Park and regional or functional division of the Midway Attractions operating group has a divisional director, who is supported by a management team and who reports directly to the relevant operating group managing director. This decentralised management structure empowers site management to make commercial and operational decisions locally, enabling real-time reaction to local market conditions. Our senior management team is also supported by the Merlin Magic Making team, which is our unique, creative and project management resource. Merlin Magic Making also provides creative design and production. Our strong local management teams are often a result of our culture of training and development, with central and local programmes to develop skills at all levels of the organisation. The commitment of our employees is best demonstrated by the results of the 2019 annual staff survey. Our employee engagement score is one of Merlin’s Key Performance Indicators, measuring whether our teams think we are a ‘‘great place to perform,’’ ‘‘a great place for customers’’ and a ‘‘great place to work.’’ In 2019, our engagement score was 87 per cent., which is above the global average for this type of survey. Our senior management team is supported by Blackstone and KIRKBI, with whom we have meaningful and successful history. Blackstone had previously been our majority shareholder since a management backed buy-out investment in 2005. At the same time, we acquired rights to LEGOLAND Parks from KIRKBI A/S, who signed the licensing and co-operation agreement with us, and KIRKBI became one of our shareholders.

Strategic initiatives we have taken include: _The Merlin Annual Pass and Merlin Pass Monthly Membership_ We offer customers a pass that enables them to visit all Attractions within a particular country for one year for an up-front fee (the ‘‘Merlin Annual Pass’’). Merlin Annual Passes are available in the United Kingdom, Germany, the United States and Australia. In the United Kingdom, we also allow customers to pay a monthly fee on a minimum twelve-month contract as part of a Merlin Pass Monthly Membership in order to enjoy entry to over 30 of our Attractions in the United Kingdom. Merlin Pass Monthly Memberships are offered at two price points to offer customers either standard or premium amenities. The membership pass accounts for approximately 30 per cent. of all online U.K.-wide pass sales. The key benefits of the Merlin Annual Pass and Merlin Pass Monthly Membership include: driving customer loyalty and brand-awareness, increasing revenue visibility and securing cash flows in advance, and potentially increasing the level of commercial spend. _Accesso Ticketing_ The roll-out of the accesso ‘‘Passport’’ ticketing system across our estate is largely complete. Previously, customers had to purchase tickets for our various Attractions separately using a fragmented ticketing system. Accesso helps standardise ticketing across our estate, giving us greater opportunities to up-sell and cross-sell tickets, which we believe will be of particular benefit for cluster Attractions. Accesso provides for benefits in mobile sales and ticketing, Merlin Annual Pass management and queue-busting ticket sales. There is a particular focus on online sales and bookings to improve the customer ‘‘digital journey.’’ Online pre-bookings help provide a short-term hedge against the impact of poor weather. They also offer opportunities to cross-sell commercial spend items, such as overnight accommodation and priority ride passes. _Group Promotions and Marketing_ We apply flexible pricing and promotional strategy to manage visitor numbers through peaks and troughs of attendance, to extend the length of stay and to encourage repeat visits and to enhance overall revenue from each Attraction. Such pricing strategies include promotional discounts, such as selling admission through a retailer’s loyalty card programme, and wider national marketing campaigns, such as one part of a newspaper advertising promotions and ‘‘on pack’’ promotions of major consumer brands. We have conducted successful national promotions in the United Kingdom, including promotions with Tesco, McDonalds and Kellogg’s, as well as abroad. We use these methods to strategically drive demand for the Attractions at times when visitor numbers are typically lower, to drive commercial spend and to achieve ‘‘low-cost’’ advertising to build Attraction and brand-awareness. Online channels provide opportunities for more targeted promotions with lower lead times in the future. _Procurement Synergies_ Our scale allows us to exploit procurement cost-efficiencies within a country or region and across clusters and we seek to achieve benefits from such savings as we increase our global scale. 121 ----- _Productivity Agenda_ We have successfully mitigated cost pressures in recent years, resulting from legislative changes, such as the U.K. national living wage, and significant increases in utility and business rates. We are also increasingly seeing the impact of tighter labour markets in many parts of the world, such as Southern California, Southern Germany and the South East of England. To date, our ability to mitigate costs has been achieved largely through Attraction-level savings and tactical efficiency improvements. Our global productivity agenda gathered pace in 2018, aimed at streamlining and evolving our back office and operations to provide long-term sustainable savings. For example, we are developing our new cloud based finance system, the roll-out of which we commenced in the fourth quarter of the 2019 financial year across our North American Midway estate, to stimulate better use of technology and the centralisation and standardisation of activities. As a part of ‘‘model evolution,’’ we have launched initiatives seeking to simplify and streamline the operations of our smaller Midway Attractions and applied lean continuous improvement principles across our Theme Parks. We have also exited certain non-core smaller Midway Attractions. As this programme accelerates, we expect to incur total one-off costs of approximately £35 million from 2018 through 2021, of which £11 million has been incurred as at 28 December 2019. As at December 28 2019, we expect that these initiatives will generate up to £35 million of sustainable, annualised savings by 2022, including back office costs savings and operational savings. We expect to generate these savings through a number of initiatives, including the centralization of activities into shared service hubs, the automation of processes, dynamic pricing tools and organisational syndication. In addition, we believe there may be opportunities for cost-savings beyond what was initially anticipated. For example, we expect to generate an additional £2 million of annual savings as a result of our de-listing from the London Stock Exchange. In addition to delivering financial savings, our agenda seeks to improve productivity, better enabling our Attraction staff and general managers to focus on delivering memorable experiences for our guests.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

We expect our enhanced Theme Parks will benefit from the short break tourism market and complement the business generated by our day visit market. As at 28 December 2019, we had a total of 4,490 rooms across our Theme Parks. These include themed on-site accommodation at all of our open LEGOLAND Parks, with the exception of LEGOLAND Dubai, where we intend to open a hotel, ranging from 61 to 263 rooms. LEGOLAND Deutschland, LEGOLAND Billund and LEGOLAND Florida each include a holiday village, ranging from 166 to 319 rooms. LEGOLAND Billund opened a 142-room Castle Hotel in 2019. We also intend to open a Pirate Island Hotel in LEGOLAND Florida. Alton Towers Resort has three hotels, including the 76-room CBeebies Land Hotel, which opened in 2017 and 102 ‘‘stargazing pods,’’ which opened in 2019. Gardaland Resort has three hotels, including the Magic Hotel, which opened in 2019, Chessington World of Adventures Resort has two hotels and THORPE PARK Resort and Heide-Park Resort each has one hotel. In addition, Warwick Castle has a 65-room ‘‘Knight’s Village’’ and Heide-Park Resort has a 165-room holiday camp. We believe these hotels and holiday villages provide an integral contribution to the overall customer experience, help drive pre-booking, increase multi-day ticket sales and improve guest satisfaction. We believe that this destination positioning has already extended visitor market reach to over five hours drive time and has enhanced revenues from both primary admissions, including multi-day tickets and second gate admission fees, and commercial spend. The latter is typically comprised of the sale of food and beverages, merchandise and souvenirs as a result of longer average lengths of stay. We have continued our strategy of investing in second gate and up-sell Attractions, where appropriate, to lengthen overall visitor times and enhance revenues. In 2018 and 2019, we opened three second gate Attractions at our Theme Parks in the United Kingdom and Asia. In 2019, we announced the targeted opening of a LEGOLAND Waterpark as a second gate at Gardaland Resort, in addition to Gardaland Resort’s existing second gate, SEA LIFE Aquarium.

For example, in September 2019, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to partner in the development of LEGOLAND Sichuan and operate it under a management contract arrangement, with the resort scheduled to open by the end of 2023. In addition, in November 2019, we entered into an agreement with the Shanghai Jinshan District Government, CMC Inc. and KIRKBI to develop a LEGOLAND resort in the Jinshan District of Shanghai to open after 2023. Under the terms of the agreement, all parties will form a joint venture company and contribute funding to the construction and development of LEGOLAND Shanghai. Given the strength of the LEGO and LEGOLAND brands and the success of our existing LEGOLAND Parks, we see significant scope for new LEGOLAND Parks, particularly in Asia, and we are committed to ensuring that future expansion is carefully planned and executed in order to maintain core brand values. We have three operating and investment models with respect to the development of LEGOLAND Parks. Firstly, in more proven locations, we follow an ‘‘owned and operated’’ model. Under this approach, we make the necessary capital investment to secure the land and develop the infrastructure ourselves. We have used this model in our European and North American LEGOLAND Parks and LEGOLAND New York and LEGOLAND Korea are being developed under this model. Second, in new and unproven locations, we use a low capital commitment model, whereby the capital investment is provided by a third-party and we operate the park pursuant to a management agreement arrangement and are-paid annual operating fees. We operate LEGOLAND Malaysia under this model. We do not own the park but instead operate it pursuant to a development and management contract with our partners. The Malaysian government provided the funds to develop LEGOLAND Malaysia. We own a 20 per cent. interest in the company that owns LEGOLAND Malaysia. LEGOLAND Dubai is operated under a similar management contract model, whereby LL Dubai Theme Park LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of DXB Entertainments, owns the assets and we operate the park. We do not have an equity interest in LEGOLAND Dubai. We intend for LEGOLAND Sichuan to adopt a similar structure. See ‘‘Business—Material Contracts.’’ Third, we can operate parks under a ‘‘leased and operated’’ model. Under this approach, the acquisition of the park site, the development of the infrastructure and the basic construction is funded by a third-party partner. We fund and build the rides and the necessary theming, lease the site on a long-term basis, and operate the LEGOLAND Park. LEGOLAND Japan, for example, was developed using this approach with a subsidiary of KIRKBI as the lessor.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

We have demonstrated a track record of identifying, implementing and integrating both large and small acquisitions and delivering significant value uplift through improving the acquired operations. Examples of this strategy include the original acquisition of LEGOLAND Billund, LEGOLAND California, LEGOLAND Deutschland and LEGOLAND Windsor as well as the acquisitions of Gardaland, the Tussauds Group, the Sydney Attractions Group and Living and Leisure Australia. In 2016, we acquired a minority interest in BIG BUS Tours and entered into co-promotion agreements with them in certain city centre locations. We have not made any acquisitions since 2017, as we continue to assess opportunities where potential targets can complement our organic growth plans and meet our strict investment return criteria.

Our company was formed in 1999 when Nick Varney, our Group Chief Executive Officer, led a management buy-out from Vardon Attractions Limited (‘‘Vardon _Attractions’’) to form Merlin Entertainments. At that time, our business comprised 17 SEA LIFE Centres_ in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Republic of Ireland, The Netherlands, Belgium and Spain, and the London Dungeon and York Dungeon. From 1999 to 2005, we undertook a major expansion of our SEA LIFE and Dungeons brands, which continue to be important brands in our business today. As a result of subsequent growth and acquisitions, we now have a mixture of brands and Attractions that range from small visitor attractions to national theme parks. Our ownership has changed a number of times since our formation in 1999, with Hermes Private Equity acquiring the business in 2004 and Blackstone becoming a majority shareholder in May 2005. On 13 November 2013, we completed our initial public offering and listing of the Merlin Shares on the London Stock Exchange. On 4 November 2019, the transaction to take Merlin private became effective and Merlin’s shares were delisted from the London Stock Exchange. Merlin is now under the ownership of the Consortium, which shares the long-term strategic vision of Merlin becoming the global leader in location based entertainment.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

We further strengthened our portfolio of assets in May 2007 by acquiring The Tussauds Group from Dubai International Capital. As part of the acquisitions of the LEGOLAND Parks and The Tussauds Group, each of KIRKBI and Dubai International Capital, respectively, became shareholders. Since January 2011, we have completed the following strategic acquisitions or developments across our brands: - in March 2011, we acquired the Sydney Attractions Group, adding six Attractions to our portfolio. These Attractions have since been rebranded. We have now exited from two of these six Attractions, the small Attractions of SEA LIFE Manly and WILD LIFE Hamilton Island; - in October 2011, we opened LEGOLAND Florida, built on the site of the former Cypress Gardens theme park; - in February 2012, we acquired Living and Leisure Australia, adding a further nine Attractions to our portfolio (of which the Australian ski resorts at Mount Hotham and Falls Creek were sold in April 2019). These Attractions have since been rebranded; - in September 2012, we opened our first Theme Park in Asia with the opening of LEGOLAND Malaysia, which we operate under a management contract, although we hold a minority equity interest in IDR, which, together with its subsidiaries, owns the park; - in October 2016, we opened LEGOLAND Dubai Resort, which is being operated under a management contract, although we hold a minority equity interest in the hotel scheduled to open at the site in 2020; - in 2016, we acquired a minority interest in BIG BUS Tours and entered into co-promotion agreements with them in a number of city centre locations; - in 2017, we opened LEGOLAND Japan, which is ‘‘leased and operated’’; - in 2018, we opened seven new Midway Attractions, which comprised LEGOLAND Discovery Centre in Birmingham, the Shanghai Dungeon, LEGOLAND Discovery Centre in Columbus, Peppa Pig World of Play in Shanghai, The Bear Grylls Adventure in Birmingham, Little BIG City in Beijing and SEA LIFE Nagoya; and - in 2019, we opened eight new Midway Attractions, which comprised the Alton Towers Dungeon, LEGOLAND Discovery Centres in Beijing, San Antonio and Shenyang, SEA LIFE Attractions in Malaysia and Shenyang, Peppa Pig World of Play in Dallas and Michigan. We have also continued to invest in the Existing Estate with a number of new rides and features at Attractions. In 2017, this included a NINJAGO World at each of LEGOLAND Windsor, Germany and Florida, the Gruffalo River Adventure Ride at Chessington World of Adventure Resort and Ocean Invaders at SEA LIFE London Aquarium. In 2018, this included Wicker Man roller coaster in Alton Towers Resort, a new ‘‘Justice League’’ feature at Madame Tussauds in Orlando and Sydney and the first 124 ----- ‘‘intelligent’’ wax figure at Madame Tussauds, Shanghai as well as the launch of ‘‘LEGO City: Deep Sea _Adventure’’ at LEGOLAND California. In 2019, this included ‘‘LEGO Movie World’’ at LEGOLAND_ Florida, the re-launch of the Colossos roller coaster at Heide-Park Resort, ‘‘Day and Night on the Reef’’ at SEA LIFE Sydney Aquarium and the launch of ‘‘The LEGO Movie 2 Experience,’’ ‘‘The LEGO Movie City _4-D—Officer in Pursuit’’ and The Haunted House Monster Party ride at LEGOLAND Windsor. In 2020,_ this included the DUPLO rollercoaster at LEGOLAND Windsor. In addition, we have made significant investments in accommodation to increase the number of short break and multi-day visitors. In 2017, we opened a 61-room ‘‘Castle Hotel’’ at LEGOLAND Windsor, a 166-room LEGOLAND Florida Beach Retreat and in partnership with BBC Worldwide a CBeebies Land Hotel at Alton Towers Resort. In 2018, we opened a 142-room ‘‘Pirate Island’’ themed hotel at LEGOLAND Deutschland, a 252-room hotel at LEGOLAND Japan and a 250-room ‘‘LEGO Castle’’ hotel at LEGOLAND California. In 2019, we opened 372 rooms, including the Magic Hotel at Gardaland Resort, ‘‘stargazing pods’’ at Alton Towers Resort and the Castle Hotel at LEGOLAND Billund.

The license is subject to certain termination rights, though our Directors believe that such termination is highly unlikely. See ‘‘—Material Contracts—Intellectual Property’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Market and Our Business—Our use of the LEGOLAND and LEGO _trademarks, content and other intellectual property rights are subject to the terms and conditions of the LCA.’’_ The strength of the LEGOLAND and LEGO brands, combined with our expertise in operating branded Attractions, has led to a successful relationship with the KIRKBI Group. This is reflected in continued investment in and development of the existing LEGOLAND Parks and associated accommodation since acquisition, the subsequent take-private transaction and the profitable growth delivered across the LEGOLAND Parks since acquisition. Revenue from the LEGOLAND Parks operating group increased to £669 million for the 2019 financial year from £637 million for the 2018 financial year and £609 million for the 2017 financial year. In addition, we have successfully developed the LEGOLAND Discovery Centre brand with the opening of 23 Attractions under this brand since 2007. We have also actively promoted the LEGOLAND Parks with the development and opening of LEGOLAND Florida in October 2011, LEGOLAND Malaysia in September 2012, LEGOLAND Dubai in 2016 and LEGOLAND Japan in 2017, with LEGOLAND New York now targeted to open in 2021 and LEGOLAND Korea targeted to open by 2022. In September 2019, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to partner in the development of LEGOLAND Sichuan and operate it under a management contract arrangement, with the resort scheduled to open by the end of 2023. In addition, in November 2019, we entered into an agreement with the Shanghai Jinshan District Government, CMC Inc. and KIRKBI to develop a LEGOLAND resort in the Jinshan District of Shanghai to open after 2023. Under the terms of the agreement, all parties will form a joint venture company and contribute funding to the construction and development of LEGOLAND Shanghai. We believe our relationship and arrangements with KIRKBI are of mutual benefit to us and to the KIRKBI Group due to the broader global exposure of the LEGOLAND and LEGO brands and the benefit of the continued success of our market leading Attractions. The relationship with the KIRKBI Group has enabled us to develop and operate uniquely branded, interactive family theme parks. For example, the development of a LEGOLAND Park in Japan has been funded through a ‘‘leased and operated’’ model whereby we invested approximately one-third of the value of the park and lease the balance of the assets from a property company which is a subsidiary of KIRKBI, paying a turnover based rent. See ‘‘—Material Contracts’’ and ‘‘Certain Relationships and Related Party _Transactions.’’_ KIRKBI A/S holds a 75 per cent. ownership share in the LEGO Group and a 100 per cent. ownership of the LEGO and LEGOLAND trademarks and through KIRKBI, holds 50 per cent. of the shares in our company. 125 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,604
187,Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.51,Our Brands and Attractions,17.51.1,Midway Attractions,"We have recognisable and well-regarded brands in the industry, including SEA LIFE, Madame Tussauds, The Dungeons, LEGOLAND Discovery Centre and the Eye. The Midway Attractions operating group consists of chainable, branded, predominantly city centre and coastal visitor attractions, which draw tourists as well as visitors from the local markets. As at 28 December 2019, we operated 116 Midway Attractions across 22 countries. Each individual Midway Attraction is a self-contained, mainly indoor facility, ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 square feet and averaging 30,000 square feet, requiring a much lower initial investment than in the Resort Theme Parks and LEGOLAND Parks operating groups. Midway Attractions are also typically less reliant on repeat visitors than our Theme Parks, require lower ongoing capital expenditure to maintain guest satisfaction and require lower marketing expenditure to attract visitors, as a result of their locations in city centres, coastal towns and destination malls that experience high levels of foot traffic from both tourists and visitors from the local markets. The integrated nature of each Midway Attraction and resulting ability to control visitor flow also contribute to each Midway Attraction’s low ongoing operating costs. With relatively low visitor length of stay of generally up to two-hours, each Midway Attraction can accommodate a high turnover of visitors each day, enhancing their revenue generating potential. Midway Attractions generate revenue at both the start and conclusion of each visit, through admission fees and merchandise sales, respectively, and tend to generate a relatively high cash spend given the short length of stay. In the 2019 financial year, 97 per cent. of our revenue at our Midway Attractions comprised visitor revenue. In the 2019 financial year, we generated £652 million of visitor revenue at our Midway Attractions. At larger sites, we offer evening corporate events and functions to increase site usage. In aggregate, our Midway Attractions attracted 40.2 million visitors in the 2019 financial year. In the 2019 financial year, the revenue per capita at a Midway Attraction was £16.05. In the 2019 financial year, we opened eight new Midway Attractions, which comprised the Alton Towers Dungeon, LEGOLAND Discovery Centres in Beijing, San Antonio and Shenyang, SEA LIFE Attractions in Malaysia and Shenyang and Peppa Pig World of Play in Dallas and Michigan and we closed, sold or otherwise transferred five Midway Attractions, comprising Hotham Ski Field, Falls Creek Ski Field, SEA LIFE Chongqing, The Jurassic Skyline and Wild Life Hamilton Island. _SEA LIFE_ SEA LIFE is our most visited Midway Attraction brand and has historically generated greater revenue than any of our other Midway Attraction brands. SEA LIFE combines theming and marine biology expertise to provide an educational and entertaining family experience. The first SEA LIFE Centre (now closed) was opened in Oban, Scotland in 1979. Our next SEA LIFE Centre was opened in 1983 and still operates today. As at 28 December 2019, there were 46 SEA LIFE Attractions across the globe. This included one operated as a second gate at Gardaland Resort as part of the Resort Theme Parks operating group. Within the LEGOLAND Parks operating group, three such Attractions are operated as second gates at each of LEGOLAND California, LEGOLAND Japan and LEGOLAND Malaysia. In August 2019, we announced the closure of The Jurassic Skyline Attraction, a second gate at SEA LIFE Weymouth. SEA LIFE Centres are able to attract repeat visitors by refreshing their displays and by regularly opening new displays which can be rotated across all of our SEA LIFE Centres. We are also continuously improving our existing SEA LIFE Centres with new Attractions such as our ‘‘Ocean Invaders’’ feature at SEA LIFE London Aquarium, which we launched in 2018 and our launch of ‘‘Day and Night on the Reef’’ at SEA LIFE Sydney Aquarium. SEA LIFE Centres typically target families with young children and schools and we believe their easily communicated concept is ideal for entering new markets through new developments and infill acquisitions. For example, we opened a new SEA LIFE Centre in Shenyang, China in 2018. SEA LIFE champions the cause of marine conservation through education and awareness. This is emphasised by the ‘‘Breed, Rescue, Protect’’ programme that is at the heart of SEA LIFE business models across the estate and demonstrates to visitors the conservation values of the brand. 126 ----- _Madame Tussauds_ Madame Tussauds is one of our most famous brands and has provided entertainment through the display of life-size wax figures to visitors for over 200 years. Madame Tussauds has strong relevance to today’s popular culture in both mature and emerging markets and is frequently endorsed by celebrities, providing significant public relations opportunities. The first Madame Tussauds was established in London in 1835 and it has been at its present location since 1884. It has become an iconic London tourist attraction. As at 28 December 2019, there were 23 Madame Tussauds Attractions in twelve countries worldwide, of which fourteen have been opened since our acquisition of the Tussauds Group in 2007, including Madame Tussauds Nashville and Madame Tussauds Delhi, which opened in 2017. In 2019, we announced the opening of our first Madame Tussauds franchise in Prague in collaboration with Wax Museum—Svet Zabavy, s.r.o. Madame Tussauds are currently located in Amsterdam, Bangkok, Beijing, Berlin, Blackpool, Hollywood, Hong Kong, Istanbul, London, Las Vegas, Nashville, New Delhi, New York, Orlando, San Francisco, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo, Vienna, Washington and Wuhan. Madame Tussauds Attractions typically target a broad visitor demographic, in particular females (with a particular trend towards 30 to 40 year olds), teens and young adults. The brand also typically targets discreet audiences, with particular wax figures proving very successful with particular audiences. _The Eye Brand_ As at 28 December 2019, we operated three observation attractions under the Eye brand: the London Eye, situated on the South Bank of the River Thames in central London; the Sydney Tower Eye in downtown Sydney overlooking Darling Harbour and the Sydney Opera House with views to the outlying suburbs; and the Blackpool Tower Eye in the U.K. Revenue from our Eye brand is generated through ticket sales, as well as sales of a range of value-added products such as private capsules to rent for an event or occasion, river cruises, food and beverages, photographic souvenirs and themed merchandise. The London Eye opened in March 2000 as part of London’s millennium building programme. The London Eye consists of a rotating wheel with 32 clear glass capsules, each capable of holding approximately 25 passengers, that turns at a rate of approximately two rotations per hour. The capsules give 360� panoramic views over London and rise over 135 metres above the ground, making it the tallest observation wheel in Europe. The London Eye has become one of the iconic sights of London and has won over 40 awards for national and international tourism and engineering achievement. In addition, each of the three Eye Attractions have 4-D pre-shows, which complement the Attractions. _LEGOLAND Discovery Centre_ The LEGOLAND Discovery Centre Attractions have a focus on ‘‘playful learning,’’ offering a combination of indoor Lego-based rides and activities centred around the main ‘‘Miniland’’ attraction, which contains reduced scale models built from LEGO bricks, featuring landmarks from the host country and surrounding countries, typically situated in the middle of the park. These experiences include a factory tour, ‘‘Build and _Test’’ and 4-D cinema, with the overall visitor experience focused on hands-on LEGO play._ The first LEGOLAND Discovery Centre was launched in Berlin in March 2007. LEGOLAND Discovery Centres are typically located in shopping malls and city centres and offer fun and playful learning experiences for children between the ages of three and twelve years. A typical visit to a LEGOLAND Discovery Centre lasts approximately two hours. As at 28 December 2019, there were 23 LEGOLAND Discovery Centres open in Arizona, Atlanta, Birmingham, Berlin, Boston, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Istanbul, Kansas City, Manchester, Melbourne, Michigan, New Jersey, Oberhausen, Osaka, Philadelphia, San Jose, Scheveningen, Shanghai, Shenyang, Tokyo, Toronto and Westchester. We opened three new LEGOLAND Discovery Centres in Beijing, San Antonio and Shenyang in 2019. _The Dungeons_ The Dungeons are themed indoor Attractions with strong historical and irreverent horror references, rides and live entertainment typically targeting teenagers and young adults. As at 28 December 2019, there were eleven Dungeons, located in Amsterdam, Berlin, Blackpool, Edinburgh, Hamburg, London, San Francisco, Shanghai, Staffordshire and York and one at Warwick Castle which is an up-sell attraction. The London Dungeon is the best known in the portfolio and has been in operation since 1976. We relocated the London Dungeon in 2013 to the South Bank, adjacent to the London SEA LIFE and the London Eye 127 ----- Attractions, which has enabled the London Dungeon to benefit from increased cluster sales and synergistic operational savings. We opened a new Dungeon Attraction in Alton Towers Resort in 2019. _Little BIG City_ In 2017, we opened a new Midway Attraction brand in Berlin called Little BIG City and in 2018, launched a Little BIG City in Beijing. Little BIG City is our take on a model village with a unique fusion of miniature models and modern technology to make the history of the city come alive. _Other_ In 2015, we opened ‘‘DreamWorks Tours’ Shrek’s Adventure!,’’ an interactive experience based around DreamWorks characters on the London South Bank site, close to the London Eye. In 2018, we opened our first ‘‘Peppa Pig World of Play’’ Attraction in Shanghai, having established multiterritory exclusivity with Entertainment One (which Hasbro acquired in 2019) to roll-out a variety of location-based Attractions based on the Peppa Pig intellectual property. In the 2019 financial year, we opened Peppa Pig World of Play Attractions in Dallas and Michigan. In 2018, we opened our first pilot ‘‘Bear Grylls Adventure’’ Attraction, having secured global exclusivity on the ‘‘Bear Grylls Adventure’’ concept. Following the Living and Leisure Australia acquisition in February 2012, we own and operate two Treetop Walk experiences in Victoria and New South Wales, Australia. In addition, we acquired two WILD LIFE Australian animal adventure Attractions as part of the Sydney Attractions Group acquisition. We have subsequently exited from one of these Attractions, WILD LIFE Hamilton Island.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

Our LEGOLAND Parks are typically targeted at families with children aged two to twelve years. The LEGOLAND Parks benefit from a very high brand-awareness level as a result of their affiliation with the LEGO brand, which was announced as the ‘‘World’s Most Powerful _Brand’’ in the Brand Finance Global 500 report in 2017 and the ‘‘World’s Most Powerful Toy Brand’’ in the_ Brand Finance Global 500 report in 2019. We use the LEGO and LEGOLAND trademarks to develop and operate the parks pursuant to the LCA with the KIRKBI Group. The KIRKBI Group is a 75 per cent. shareholder of the LEGO Group, has 100 per cent. ownership of the LEGO and LEGOLAND trademarks and through KIRKBI, a 50 per cent. shareholder in Merlin. We have three business models for our LEGOLAND Parks: - Our ‘‘owned and operated’’ model is used in proven locations and geographies. We own and operate our LEGOLAND Parks in Florida, California, the United Kingdom, Germany and Denmark, and plan to do the same in respect of LEGOLAND Park in New York and Korea; - Our ‘‘leased and operated’’ model is used in markets that are newer to us or in connection with projects that are part of a broader development. Under this model, we have full operational control and ownership of rides and LEGO theming and lease the land and infrastructure form a partner. See ‘‘— _Material Contracts.’’ We ‘‘lease and operate’’ our LEGOLAND Park in Nagoya, Japan; and_ - Our ‘‘manage and operate’’ model is used in new markets and unproven locations and/or in connection with projects that are part of a broader development. We do not own or lease our LEGOLAND Parks in Malaysia and Dubai but manage and operate them pursuant to a management contract. We intend for LEGOLAND Sichuan to adopt a similar structure. See ‘‘—Material Contracts.’’ The LEGOLAND Parks received an aggregate of 15.7 million visitors in the 2019 financial year. Revenue from the LEGOLAND Parks operating group increased by 5 per cent. from the 2017 financial year to the 2018 financial year, and from the 2018 financial year to the 2019 financial year. The original LEGOLAND Park was opened in Billund in 1968 to showcase the LEGO brand and provide an enhanced experience to visitors to the LEGO plant. Based on the success of the concept, the LEGOLAND brand was rolled out by the KIRKBI Group into the United Kingdom in 1996, the United States in 1999 and Germany in 2002. We opened a fifth LEGOLAND Park just outside Orlando, Florida, in 2011, a sixth LEGOLAND Park in Malaysia, close to the border with Singapore, in 2012, our seventh in Dubai in 2016 and our eight in 128 ----- Nagoya, Japan in 2017. We have announced plans to develop a LEGOLAND Park in New York State, U.S. with an opening targeted for 2021 and a LEGOLAND Park in South Korea with an opening targeted for 2022, each of which we plan to own and operate. We have reached an agreement with the local province regarding partial funding, amounting to KRW 80 billion (approximately £55 million) from LL Developments, the investment arm of Gangwon Province. We also have study agreements in place for potential LEGOLAND Parks in China with a focus on operating these parks under management contracts. For example, in September 2019, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to partner in the development of LEGOLAND Sichuan and operate it under a management contract arrangement, with the resort scheduled to open by the end of 2023. In addition, in November 2019, we entered into an agreement with the Shanghai Jinshan District Government, CMC Inc. and KIRKBI to develop a LEGOLAND resort in the Jinshan District of Shanghai to open after 2023.

They typically target large populations in European markets, generally catering to the domestic market where each site is located, but with an increasing international audience at certain of the parks, particularly Gardaland Resort. All six Resort Theme Parks have associated accommodation offerings, including hotels, holiday villages, lodge accommodation or ‘‘glamping’’ which enable those parks to attract a wider range of visitors who live further from the parks. Resort Theme Parks generate revenue through both admission fees and commercial spend on sales of priority ride access passes, food and beverages, merchandise and souvenir photographs, participation games and car parking. For the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019, 78 per cent. of our revenue at our Resort Theme Parks comprised visitor revenue and 19 per cent. comprised accommodation revenue. In the 2019 financial year, we generated £304 million of visitor revenue at our Resort Theme Parks. Multi-day stays by visitors at attached and off site hotels increase this commercial spend and targeting such stays has been a growing part of the operating group’s strategy. Certain Resort Theme Parks have ‘‘second gates,’’ a concept that management plans to continue developing at other Resort Theme Parks. The Resort Theme Parks received an aggregate of 11.1 million visitors in the 2019 financial year. Revenue per capita in 2018 was £27.31. Like-for-like revenue for the Resort Theme Parks increased by 4.1 per cent. between the 2018 financial year and the 2019 financial year due in part to favourable Easter weather in the U.K., successful product launches such as the ‘‘Colossos’’ ride at Heide Park and ‘‘Room on the Broom’’ at Chessington World of Adventures Resort, and good summer trading.

The LEGOLAND Parks have been able to capitalise on the growth of the LEGO brand association by using well known LEGO characters and brands, such as LEGO NINJAGO. The LEGOLAND Parks typically target families with children aged two to twelve years and the majority of visitors to our LEGOLAND Parks fall within this demographic. This demographic does not demand expensive, large format ‘‘thrill’’ rides and LEGOLAND Parks enjoy high repeat visitor numbers. We are targeting 2021 for opening a LEGOLAND Park in Orange County, New York and 2022 for opening a LEGOLAND Park in South Korea, each of which will be ‘‘owned and operated’’ by us. Further, we have identified sites for potential LEGOLAND Parks in China with a focus on operating these parks under management contracts. For example, we have entered into agreements to develop LEGOLAND Sichuan by the end of 2023 and LEGOLAND Shanghai after 2023. 129 ----- _LEGOLAND California_ LEGOLAND California is our most visited LEGOLAND Park and is located on a 128-acre site in San Diego County, the United States, close to the Pacific Ocean. Since it opened in 1999, we have added substantial capacity to the park through new rides and Attractions and food, beverage and retail outlets. The park has more than 60 rides, shows and other Attractions and a variety of shops and restaurants. Signature features include ‘‘LEGO NINJAGO The Ride,’’ ‘‘LEGO� _City Deep Sea Adventure,’’ ‘‘Lost _Kingdom Adventure’’ and ‘‘LEGO TECHNIC�_ _Coaster.’’ LEGOLAND California operates year-round,_ with the park closed on select Tuesdays and Wednesdays in the off-peak season. Combined with Southern California’s moderate climate, this provides the park with a smoother seasonality profile, compared to most of the other Theme Parks. In August 2008, we opened a SEA LIFE Centre as a second gate at LEGOLAND California. We have since added the themed LEGOLAND Waterpark, opened in 2010 and expanded in 2014, which can be accessed by park visitors for an additional fee. We also developed a 250 room on-site themed hotel, opened in 2013. We opened a 250 room LEGOLAND California Castle Hotel in 2018. _LEGOLAND Billund_ LEGOLAND Billund opened in 1968. It began as a nine acre Miniland which attracted 625,000 visitors in the first year and has since grown to a park of approximately 38 acres with an additional 15 acres owned and 20 acres rented for car parking and support services. LEGOLAND Billund is open from March to October and consists of more than 50 rides, shows and other Attractions and a variety of shops and restaurants.

Also located at the Billund resort is a chalet-style holiday village with 850 lodges and a Waterpark, each of which is managed by Lalandia. LEGOLAND Billund is located in the middle of Jutland on the mainland of Denmark and benefits from good transport links being close to Billund International Airport. In the 2019 financial year, domestic Danish visitors accounted for more than 51 per cent. of the total visitors, with the remainder visiting mostly from Germany, Norway, Sweden and The Netherlands. _LEGOLAND Windsor_ LEGOLAND Windsor, the United Kingdom’s most visited theme park in 2017 according to the TEA/ AECOM Report for 2018, opened in 1996 as the first LEGOLAND Park outside Denmark. The park is located close to Windsor, United Kingdom and is open from March to late October or early November. The park has more than 55 rides, shows and other Attractions and a variety of shops and restaurants. Signature rides and Attractions include the ‘‘Miniland,’’ ‘‘Atlantis by SEA LIFE,’’ ‘‘Laser Raiders,’’ ‘‘LEGO _City Driving School’’ and the ‘‘Dragon coaster.’’ In 2017, ‘‘NINJAGO World’’ was launched, which includes a_ LEGO interactive family signature ride, which has been rolled out across other LEGOLAND Parks too. In 2019, ‘‘The LEGO Movie 2 Experience,’’ ‘‘The LEGO Movie City 4D—Officer in Pursuit’’ and The Haunted House Monster Party ride were-launched in selected LEGOLAND Parks. In March 2012, we opened a 150-room LEGO-themed hotel and conference centre to enhance the resort’s appeal to the short break market and it achieved in excess of 95 per cent. occupancy rates for the 2017 peak season (being July and August). A second hotel, the LEGOLAND Windsor Castle Hotel was opened in July 2017, which includes 61 fully themed premium rooms. We have also recently built the Sensory Space in Heartlake City at LEGOLAND Windsor. Sensory Space has been specifically designed for those with additional sensory needs, and is the first dedicated sensory facility of its kind in our theme parks and is an open space full of interactive sensory experiences, with vibrating bean bags, soft seating, interactive projections, bubble tubes, infinity tunnels, tactile panels and soft lighting, designed to create a calm space to relax. LEGOLAND Windsor is located within a one hour drive from London and benefits from good transport links. _LEGOLAND Deutschland_ LEGOLAND Deutschland opened in May 2002 in G¨unzburg, Bavaria, Germany. LEGOLAND Deutschland has more than 60 rides, shows and Attractions in ten themed areas, and a variety of shops and 130 ----- restaurants, and is open from the end of March to early November. Signature rides and Attractions include ‘‘The Great LEGO Race,’’ a LEGO NINJAGO 4-D ride, ‘‘Temple X-pedition,’’ ‘‘Jungle X-pedition’’ and ‘‘LEGOLAND Atlantis by SEA LIFE’’ and MINILAND, nationally and internationally recognised buildings being rebuilt out of more than 25 million LEGO bricks on a 1:20 scale. Approximately 62 per cent. of visitors in the 2019 financial year were German. The park is serviced by good transport links and is within 1.5 hours’ drive from both Munich and Stuttgart. In 2008, we opened our first holiday village at LEGOLAND Deutschland, initially with 48 chalets, a refectory, a playground and a 177-space campsite. Since then, there have been further phases of development, including the addition of a Knight’s Castle and a King’s Castle extension, additional chalets and barrel-style accommodations. In March 2018, we opened a 142-room ‘‘Pirate Island’’ themed hotel at LEGOLAND Deutschland. At the end of the 2018 financial year, the park had 72 chalets (144 rooms), 136 rooms in the castle hotels, 39 barrels and a 165-space campsite. _LEGOLAND Florida_ LEGOLAND Florida was built on the site of the former Cypress Gardens theme park and opened to the public in October 2011. It exceeded its business case visitor numbers in the first full-year of operation. Due to the site’s history and pre-existing infrastructure, we believe the development cost was substantially below the standard cost to develop a comparable theme park. The park is located on a 150-acre site on the shores of Lake Eloise in the city of Winter Haven, Florida and is an approximately 45 minute drive from Orlando and downtown Tampa. The park has more than 50 rides, shows and Attractions, restaurants, shopping, and a botanical garden, and is based on thirteen themed zones, including Miniland USA, the Imagination Zone, LEGO City, ‘‘Heartlake City’’ and NINJAGO. LEGOLAND Florida operates all year-round, with the park closed on some Tuesdays and Wednesdays during off-peak periods. In May 2012, we added a themed LEGOLAND Waterpark which can be accessed by park visitors for an additional fee. In 2015, we opened a 152-room LEGOLAND Florida hotel and in 2017 we opened a 166-room holiday village. We expect to open a Pirate Island Hotel in LEGOLAND Florida, which would be the first LEGO Pirate hotel in North America. _LEGOLAND Malaysia_ LEGOLAND Malaysia was developed on a 76-acre greenfield site in southern Malaysia close to the Singapore border and the park was opened in 2012. In 2013, a 249-room LEGOLAND Hotel (which has since been expanded to 263 rooms) and a LEGOLAND Waterpark were built. We do not own the Park but instead operate it pursuant to a development and management agreement with Malaysian partners, with funds provided by the Malaysian government under which we were-paid an initial development fee and receive an annual operating fee based on the revenue and EBITDA of the Resort and an annual management fee based on yearly inflationary consumer price index increases. We hold 20 per cent. of the issued share capital of the project company that owns the Park. The park has more than 70 interactive rides, slides, shows and Attractions. The Attractions are grouped into themed areas of which the centrepiece is MINILAND, where Asian landmarks have been recreated using more than 30 million LEGO bricks.

The park is located at Kinjofuto, Minato ku, Nagoya, Japan. We developed the park under our ‘‘leased and operated’’ model, whereby we invested in the park with a partner from which we lease unowned assets in exchange for rent. Under this model, we invested approximately one-third of the total park cost, with the balance of the assets, primarily park infrastructure assets, funded and owned by one of KIRKBI’s subsidiaries through a combination of equity and external debt provided by Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. We lease the park and associated assets on arm’s-length commercial terms, paying a turnover based rent with an annual floor on a 50-year lease. The park has more than 40 interactive rides, shows and Attractions, grouped into eight themed areas such as Miniland, Bricktopia and Knights’ Kingdom, with approximately 10,000 LEGO models and 17 million LEGO bricks.

With the exception of the LEGOLAND and LEGO trademarks, which are licensed to us under an agreement with KIRKBI A/S, we have pursued a programme of registering trademarks relevant to the Key Brands in those territories in which we operate under the Key Brands, including the United Kingdom, Member States of the EEA, the United States and various countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Pursuant to the LCA, we have an exclusive and worldwide right to use: (i) certain LEGOLAND registered trademarks, including the word ‘‘LEGOLAND’’ and LEGOLAND-associated logos; and (ii) various LEGO-related registered trademarks, until at least 2054 for the purpose of operating and promoting the LEGOLAND Parks and LEGOLAND Discovery Centres and for use in the construction, operation and promotion of new LEGOLAND Parks and LEGOLAND Discovery Centres including in connection with hotels and other accommodation facilities and smaller LEGOLAND Attractions such as merchandise. We pay KIRKBI A/S a royalty, calculated as a percentage of gross qualifying revenue generated by the operation of the LEGOLAND Parks and Attractions. The royalty rates are, in normal circumstances, fixed but can (i) reduce if the LEGO Group’s worldwide turnover falls below specified levels and (ii) increase, (a) in relation to any LEGOLAND Park whose qualifying revenue falls below a specified floor (being a percentage of that LEGOLAND Park’s first year’s qualifying revenue) and (b) if, but only for so long as, the number of LEGOLAND Parks that we operate falls below three. If an increase in royalty is triggered by a fall in qualifying revenue at a particular LEGOLAND Park, this increase applies to the qualifying revenue of the affected LEGOLAND Park only and continues only until the required revenue is achieved again. The amount we currently pay is approximately a low single digit percentage of revenue. The LCA requires us to develop the LEGOLAND business and the extension of the term of the LCA on an exclusive basis is subject to the development of a certain number of LEGOLAND Parks or LEGOLAND Discovery Centres. Our opening of four LEGOLAND Parks (Florida, Dubai, Japan and Malaysia) and LEGOLAND Discovery Centres since 2007, confer worldwide exclusivity until at least the end of 2054. We also have a right of first refusal under the LCA to open a new LEGOLAND Park in any country or U.S. state that becomes non-exclusive. Once the new park opens, our exclusive rights under the LCA are restored for the country or U.S. state in question. No new LEGOLAND Attractions are permitted within 100 miles of the Disneyland Resort at Anaheim in California before 31 December 2020. The LCA also includes certain operational requirements for the operation of the LEGOLAND Attractions, confirming their family orientation, the requirement of a LEGO theme, a list of minimum components for each attraction, requirements for any new rides or Attractions at any LEGOLAND venue and a requirement to monitor customer satisfaction and maintain it at above pre-determined levels, as well as to include a retail area to sell LEGO merchandise. The LCA includes rights for each party to terminate the agreement in specified circumstances. For example, if visitor satisfaction survey results fall below a specified level for a park, the relevant park may lose its license, subject to a two-year grace period, during which the park must to improve its performance to avoid losing its license. Guest satisfaction levels are currently significantly above the minimum levels required. The LCA also specifies that we may lose the right to operate the LEGOLAND brands if we are acquired by a competitor of the LEGO Group or an ‘‘inappropriate’’ person. The Consortium is currently in the process of implementing certain changes to the licensing arrangements for LEGOLAND Discovery Centres. Amongst others, these changes may include introducing a new global, 137 ----- exclusive perpetual license agreement to use the LEGO trademark for the purpose of the LEGOLAND Discovery Centres, which license agreement will be subject to separate fixed term license agreements of 20 years individually agreed for each LEGOLAND Discovery Centre.

entered into by any Debtor or Third-party Security Provider creating or expressed to create Transaction Security. _Enforcement of Transaction Security_ The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security unless instructed otherwise by (i) an Instructing Group, (ii) if, prior to the Senior Discharge Date, an Instructing Group has (A) given no instructions or has instructed the Security Agent neither to enforce or cease enforcing and (B) not required any Debtor or Third-party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal (as defined below), the Majority Second Lien

In relation to a Relevant Second Lien Default, a Second Lien Standstill Period shall mean the period (the ‘‘Second Lien Standstill Period’’) beginning on the date (the ‘‘Second Lien Standstill Start Date’’) the relevant Second Lien Creditor Representative serves a Second Lien Enforcement Notice on each of the Senior Agents in respect of such Relevant Second Lien Default and ending on the earliest to occur of: (a) the date falling 120 days after the Second Lien Standstill Start Date; (b) the date the Senior Secured Parties (other than the Second Lien Secured Creditors) take any Enforcement Action in relation to a borrower (a ‘‘Second Lien Borrower’’) or guarantor (a ‘‘Second _Lien Guarantor’’) of Second Lien Liabilities, provided, however, that if a Second Lien Standstill_ Period ends pursuant such Enforcement Action, the Second Lien Secured Creditors may only take the same Enforcement Action in relation to the relevant Second Lien Borrower or Second Lien Guarantor as the Enforcement Action taken by the Senior Secured Parties (other than the Second 177 ----- Lien Secured Creditors) against such Second Lien Borrower or Second Lien Guarantor and not against any other member of the Senior Secured Group; (c) the date of an Insolvency Event in relation to the relevant Second Lien Borrower or a particular Second Lien Guarantor against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken; (d) the expiry of any other Second Lien Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first-mentioned Second Lien Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result of a cure, waiver or other permitted remedy); (e) the date on which the consent of each of the Senior Secured Agents (acting on the instructions of the requisite majority of Senior Secured Creditors represented thereby) has been obtained; and (f) a failure to pay the principal amount outstanding under any Second Lien Debt at the final stated maturity of the amounts outstanding on that Second Lien Debt (provided that, unless otherwise agreed by the Company and the majority lenders under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, prior to the Senior Discharge Date, such maturity date or any shortening thereof is permitted by the Debt Financing Agreements in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities). _Enforcement on behalf of Second Lien Secured Creditors_ If the Security Agent has notified the Second Lien Creditor Representatives that it is enforcing Security created pursuant to any Transaction Security Document over shares of a Second Lien Borrower or a Second Lien Guarantor, no Second Lien Secured Creditor may take any action referred to above against that Second Lien Borrower or Second Lien Guarantor (or any subsidiary of that Second Lien Borrower or Second Lien Guarantor) while the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that Security in accordance with the instructions of an Instructing Group where such action might be reasonably likely to adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom. _Option to Purchase: Second Lien Creditors_ Following acceleration or the enforcement of Transaction Security upon acceleration under any Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Secured Creditors may, by giving not less than ten days’ notice, elect to purchase all but not part of the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Operating Facility Liabilities for the amount that would have been required to prepay or redeem such liabilities on such date plus certain costs and expenses. Second Lien Secured Creditors must also elect for the Hedge Counterparties to transfer their Hedging Liabilities to such Second Lien Secured Creditors in exchange (subject to specified conditions) for the amount that would have been payable under such Hedging Liabilities had they been terminated on such date plus certain costs and expenses in connection with any such purchase. _Restrictions on Enforcement by Senior Parent Creditors_ Until the First/Second Lien Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group (i) no Senior Parent Creditor or Senior Parent Investor shall direct the Security Agent to enforce or otherwise require the enforcement of any Shared Security, (ii) no Senior Parent Creditor or Senior Parent Investor shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action in relation to the Senior Parent Shared Guarantee Liabilities or (iii) no Senior Parent Creditor, Investor or Senior Parent Debt Issuer shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action in relation to the Senior Parent Debt Proceeds Loan Liabilities, except as set out under ‘‘—Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement’’ provided, however, that no such action required by the Security Agent need be taken except to the extent the Security Agent is otherwise entitled under the Intercreditor Agreement to direct such action. _Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement_ The restrictions set out above under ‘‘—Restrictions on Enforcement by Senior Parent Creditors’’ will not apply if: (a) an event of default (a ‘‘Senior Parent Event of Default’’) under any Debt Financing Agreement in respect of Senior Parent Liabilities (the ‘‘Relevant Senior Parent Default’’) is continuing; (b) each Senior Agent has received a notice of the Relevant Senior Parent Default specifying the event or circumstance in relation to the Relevant Senior Parent Default from the relevant Senior Parent Agent; (c) a Senior Parent Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and 178 ----- (d) the Relevant Senior Parent Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Senior Parent Standstill Period. Promptly upon becoming aware of a Senior Parent Event of Default, the relevant Senior Parent Agent may by notice (a ‘‘Senior Parent Enforcement Notice’’) in writing notify the Senior Agents of the existence of such Senior Parent Event of Default. In relation to a Relevant Senior Parent Default, a Senior Parent Standstill Period shall mean the period (the ‘‘Senior Parent Standstill Period’’) beginning on the date (the ‘‘Senior Parent Standstill Start Date’’) the relevant Senior Parent Agent serves a Senior Parent Enforcement Notice on each of the Senior Agents in respect of such Relevant Senior Parent Default and ending on the earliest to occur of: (a) the date falling 179 days after the Senior Parent Standstill Start Date; (b) the date the Senior Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular guarantor (a ‘‘Senior Parent Guarantor’’) of Senior Parent Liabilities, provided, however, that if a Senior Parent Standstill Period ends pursuant such Enforcement Action, the Senior Parent Finance Parties or, in respect of Senior Parent Debt Proceeds Loan Liabilities, the relevant Senior Parent Invest may only take the same Enforcement Action in relation to the relevant Senior Parent Guarantor as the Enforcement Action taken by the Senior Secured Parties against such Senior Parent Guarantor and not against any other member of the Senior Secured Group or (to the extent not a Senior Parent Guarantor) Third-party Security Provider; (c) the date of an Insolvency Event in relation to the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer or a particular Senior Parent Guarantor against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken; (d) the expiry of any other Senior Parent Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first-mentioned Senior Parent Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result of a cure, waiver or other permitted remedy); (e) the date on which the consent of each of the Senior Agents (acting on the instructions of the requisite majority of Senior Creditors represented thereby) has been obtained; and (f) a failure to pay the principal amount outstanding under any Senior Parent Debt at the final stated maturity of the amounts outstanding on that Senior Parent Debt (provided that, prior to the First/ Second Lien Discharge Date, such maturity date or any shortening thereof is permitted by the Debt Financing Agreements in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities). _Enforcement on Behalf of Senior Parent Creditors_ If the Security Agent has notified the Senior Parent Agents or the relevant Senior Parent Investor that it is enforcing Security created pursuant to any Security Document over shares of a Senior Parent Guarantor, no Senior Parent Creditor or that Senior Parent Investor may take any action referred to above against that Senior Parent Guarantor (or any subsidiary of that Senior Parent Guarantor) while the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that Security in accordance with the instructions of an Instructing Group where such action might be reasonably likely to adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom. _Option to Purchase: Senior Parent Creditors_ Following acceleration or the enforcement of Transaction Security upon acceleration under any Senior Secured Liabilities, Senior Parent Creditors may, by giving not less than ten days’ notice, elect to purchase all but not part of the Senior Secured Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Operating Facility Liabilities for the amount that would have been required to prepay or redeem such liabilities on such date plus certain costs and expenses.

The Indenture will limit the obligation to grant guarantees in favor of obligations under the Notes. The Indenture will include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory limitations, financial assistance, capital maintenance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, retention of title claims and similar principles.

This provision may not, however, be effective to protect a Guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce the applicable Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its Guarantee worthless. If a Guarantee was rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability in respect of its Guarantee could be reduced to zero.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory limitations, regulatory requirements or restrictions, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance rules, liquidity protection rules, fraudulent preference, ‘‘earnings stripping,’’ ‘‘controlled foreign corporation,’’ ‘‘thin capitalization’’ rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles. Each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of applicable law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee.

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Guarantee, as specified above, the Trustee, subject to receipt of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will execute any documents delivered to it by the Issuer in order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and termination in respect of such Guarantee. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, discharge or termination. Substantially all the operations of the Company and the Issuer are conducted through Subsidiaries of the Company. Claims of creditors of Subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Guarantors, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred shareholders and minority shareholders of those Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders. The Notes and each Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated 196 ----- to creditors (including trade creditors), preferred shareholders and minority shareholders of Subsidiaries of the Company other than the Issuer and the Guarantors. Although the Indenture will limit the incurrence of indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company, the limitations will be subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the incurrence by such Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture.

The unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to at least A100,000 or any integral multiple or A1,000 in excess thereof in relation to the Notes; (7) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control Triggering Event and shall describe each such condition, and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60-days after the notice is sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived, or that such repurchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed, or such notice or offer may be rescinded at any time in the Issuer’s sole discretion if the Issuer determines that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived; (8) any other instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with this Change of Control Triggering Event covenant, that a Holder must follow; and (9) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuer to purchase such Notes; provided that the applicable paying agent receives, not later than the close of business on the tenth Business Day prior to the expiration date of the Change of Control Offer, a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the holder of the Notes, the principal amount of Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes, or a specified portion thereof, and its election to have such Notes purchased. While the Notes are in global form and the Issuer makes an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of the Notes or withdraw such election through the facilities of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, subject to the applicable rules and regulations. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law: (1) accept for payment all Notes issued by it or portions thereof validly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the applicable paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered and not validly withdrawn; and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer. The Senior Facilities provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Company (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may provide, that certain change of 209 ----- control events with respect to the Company would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture). In addition, the Existing 2026 Notes and the Existing Senior Notes contain a change of control provision similar to the provisions described in this ‘‘—Change of Control Triggering Event’’ section but do not contain a leverage-based Change of Control Triggering Event feature. If we experience a change of control event that triggers a default under the Existing Senior Notes, the Senior Facilities or any such future Indebtedness or results in a requirement to offer to repurchase the Existing Senior Notes or the Existing 2026 Notes, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the Senior Facilities, the Existing Senior Notes, the Existing 2026 Notes and/or such future Indebtedness. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or do not refinance the Senior Facilities, the Existing Senior Notes, the Existing 2026 Notes and/or such future Indebtedness, such default or failure to repurchase any tendered Existing Senior Notes and/or Existing 2026 Notes could result in amounts outstanding under the Senior Facilities, the Existing Senior Notes, the Existing 2026 Notes or such future Indebtedness being declared due and payable and/or cause a Securitization Facility or other financing arrangements to be wound down. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Limitation _on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock’’ and, in the case of_ Secured Indebtedness, ‘‘—Certain Covenants—Liens.’’ Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third-party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer (or any Affiliate of the Issuer) has made an offer to purchase (an ‘‘Alternate Offer’’) any and all Notes validly tendered at a cash price equal to or higher than the Change of Control Payment and has purchased all Notes properly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Alternate Offer. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer. A Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes, Guarantees and/or Security Documents (but the Change of Control Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. 210 ----- The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event, including the definition of ‘‘Change of Control,’’ may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

Within 450 days after the later of (A) the date of any Asset Sale and (B) the receipt of any Net Proceeds of such Asset Sale, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply an amount not to exceed the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale, (1) to reduce Indebtedness (through a redemption, prepayment, repayment or purchase, as applicable) as follows: (a) Obligations under the Notes; (b) Obligations under any Consolidated Senior Secured Indebtedness at a price of no less than 100% of the principal amount of such Senior Secured Indebtedness, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, thereon, and in the case of revolving obligations (other than Obligations in respect of any asset-based credit facility, any revolving credit facility used for working capital purposes or the Revolving Facility), to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; 211 ----- (c) Obligations of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, and, in the case of revolving obligations (other than Obligations in respect of any asset-based credit facility, any revolving facility used for working capital purposes or the Revolving Facility), to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; or (d) to the extent such Net Proceeds are from an Asset Sale of property or assets of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor or of property or assets not constituting Collateral, Obligations of the Issuer or a Guarantor other than Subordinated Indebtedness and other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, and, in the case of revolving obligations (other than Obligations in respect of any asset-based credit facility, any revolving credit facility used for working capital purposes or the Revolving Facility), to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; _provided that to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected to purchase any_ amount of Obligations under the Notes, Senior Secured Indebtedness at a price of no less than 100% of the principal amount thereof, to the extent the creditors in respect of such Indebtedness (including the Holders) elect not to tender their Indebtedness, the Company will be deemed to have applied an amount of Net Proceeds equal to such amount not so tendered, and such amount shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds (such amount, together with the aggregate amount described under the first sentence of the fifth paragraph of this covenant, the ‘‘Declined _Proceeds’’); or_ (2) to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses, _provided that such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes or continues to constitute a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) capital expenditures or (c) acquisitions of other properties or assets that, in each of (a), (b) and (c), are used or useful in a Similar Business or replace the businesses, properties and/ or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale; or (3) any combination of the foregoing; _provided, that a binding commitment or letter of intent entered into not later than such 450th day shall be_ treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment or letter of intent so long as the Company, or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment or letter of intent with the good faith expectation that such Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment or letter of intent within the later of such 450th day and 180 days of such commitment or letter of intent (an ‘‘Acceptable Commitment’’) or, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Net Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a ‘‘Second Commitment’’) within 180 days of such cancellation or termination; _provided further that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds, as the case may be. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that the application of any or all of the Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale by the Company or a Subsidiary is (x) prohibited or delayed by applicable local law, (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents or any agreement or (z) subject to other organizational or administrative impediments from being repatriated under applicable local law, an amount equal to the portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the Company or the applicable Subsidiary; provided that if at any time within one-year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required, such repatriation of any of such affected Net Proceeds is permitted under the applicable local law, the applicable organizational document or agreement or the applicable other impediment, an amount equal to such amount of Net Proceeds so permitted to be repatriated will be promptly applied (net of any taxes, costs or expenses that would be payable or reserved against if such amounts were actually repatriated whether or not they are repatriated) in compliance with this covenant and (ii) to the extent that the Company has determined in good faith that repatriation of any or all of the Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale could have a material adverse tax consequence with respect to such Net Proceeds (which for the avoidance of doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any prepayment whereby doing so the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates and/or their equityholders would incur a tax liability, including as a result of a tax dividend or a withholding tax), the Net Proceeds so 212 ----- affected may be retained by the Company or the applicable Subsidiary and an amount equal to such Net Proceeds will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant. The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Indenture shall be construed to require the Company or any Subsidiary to repatriate cash. Any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale (other than any amounts excluded from this covenant as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph) that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the second preceding paragraph, provided that only to the extent that the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio exceeds 5.65 to 1.00, an amount not to exceed the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale (or, (x) if the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio exceeds 5.15 to 1.00 but does not exceed 5.65 to 1.00, 50% of the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale; or (y) if the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio does not exceed 5.15 to 1.00, 0% of the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale) shall be deemed to constitute ‘‘Excess Proceeds’’; _provided that any amount of Net Proceeds offered to Holders of the Notes pursuant to the second_ preceding paragraph (1) shall not be deemed to be Excess Proceeds without regard to whether such offer is accepted by any Holders. When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of (x) £175.0 million and (y) 30.0% of LTM EBITDA (the ‘‘Excess Proceeds Threshold’’), the Issuer shall make an offer (an ‘‘Asset Sale Offer’’) to all Holders of the Notes and, if required or permitted by the terms of any Indebtedness that ranks pari passu in right of payment with the Notes (‘‘Pari Passu Indebtedness’’), to the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that is, with respect to the Notes only, in an amount equal to A100,000, or an integral multiple of A1,000 in excess thereof, that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price, in the case of the Notes, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value thereof, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, and in the case of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, at the offer price required by the terms thereof, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the agreement(s) governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness. The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within 20-Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed the Excess Proceeds Threshold by delivering to the Holders the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Net Proceeds prior to the time period that may be required by the Indenture with respect to all or a part of the available Net Proceeds (the ‘‘Advance Portion’’) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (an ‘‘Advance Offer’’). To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the amount offered in the Asset Sale Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) for any purposes not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in the Asset Sale Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer shall purchase the Notes (subject to the applicable procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, as to global notes) and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis based on the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of the Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer (or Advance Offer), the amount of Excess Proceeds that resulted in the requirement to make an Asset Sale Offer shall be reset to zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion). Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Sale Offer, any remaining Net Proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer may use such Net Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. An Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Guarantees (but the Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). Pending the final application of the amount of any Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness, or otherwise use such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. 213 ----- The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or an Advance Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes. The Senior Facilities contain, and future credit agreements or other similar agreements to which the Issuer becomes a party may contain restrictions on the Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes. In the event an Asset Sale occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the repurchase of Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing Notes. In such a case, the Issuer’s failure to repurchase tendered Notes would constitute a Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, likely constitute a default under such other agreements.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, of the same class will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant. If Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock originally incurred in reliance upon a percentage of LTM EBITDA under this covenant is being refinanced and such refinancing would cause the maximum amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock thereunder to be exceeded at such time, then such refinancing will nevertheless be permitted thereunder and such additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock will be deemed to have been incurred under the applicable provision so long as the principal amount or liquidation preference of such Refinancing Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not exceed the principal amount or liquidation preference of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced plus amounts permitted by the next sentence. Any Refinancing Indebtedness and any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock permitted to be incurred under the Indenture to refinance Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clauses (1), (3), (8), (10)(b) and (21) shall be deemed to include additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to pay accrued but unpaid interest or dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting or initial purchaser discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing. 232 ----- For purposes of determining compliance with any restriction, as applicable, on the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in a given currency, the Currency Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness or liquidation preference of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock was incurred, or, at the option of the Company, first committed or first incurred or upon execution of the definitive documentation in respect thereof (whichever yields the lower Currency Equivalent); _provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in another currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable currency denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such currency denominated restriction, as applicable, shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount or liquidation preference of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount or liquidation preference set forth in sub-clause (A) of the definition of ‘‘Refinancing Indebtedness,’’ and (b) the Currency Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness and the aggregate liquidation preference of any such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock outstanding on the Acquisition Completion Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Acquisition Completion Date and the Currency Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness and the aggregate liquidation preference of any such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock outstanding on the Issue Date that was not outstanding on the Acquisition Completion Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date, and (c) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is subject to any Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is denominated covering principal amounts and interest payable on such Indebtedness or the liquidation preference and preferred equity returns on such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, the amount of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock if denominated in a given currency will be the amount of the principal payment or liquidation preference required to be made under such Currency Agreement and, otherwise, the Currency Equivalent of such amount plus the Currency Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such Currency Agreement. The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or because it is secured by different collateral or issued or guaranteed by other obligors.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

Notwithstanding the above, if such Directing Holder’s participation is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of Holders required under the Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to be taken by the Issuer (as described above). The Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively on any Noteholder Direction or Officer’s Certificate delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture without verification, investigation or otherwise as to the statements made therein. The Trustee may, but will not be obliged, to notify the Directing Holder and/or other Holders of the receipt of any Officer’s Certificate provided by the Issuer received in relation to a Noteholder Direction. In no event will the Trustee exercise any discretion with regard to its duties or responsibilities in respect of these provisions. Each Holder by accepting a Note acknowledges and agrees that the Trustee (and any agent) shall not be liable to any party howsoever arising for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the foregoing provisions, (ii) any Noteholder Direction, (iii) any Officer’s Certificate or (iv) its duties under the 244 ----- Indenture, as the Trustee may determine in its sole discretion.

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuer is required, within 20-Business Days upon becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default (unless such Default has been cured or waived within such 20-Business Day time period).",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

On the request of the Issuer, each holder of Notes shall agree to provide certain 300 ----- information, including, in the case of a passive Non-Financial Foreign Entity (‘‘NFFE’’), information on the Controlling Persons of such NFFE, along with the required supporting documentation. Similarly, each holder of Notes shall agree to actively provide to the Issuer within 30 days any information that would affect its status, as for instance a new mailing address or a new residency address. The FATCA Law may require the Issuer to disclose the names, addresses and taxpayer identification number (if available) of the holders of Notes as well as information such as account balances, income and gross proceeds (non-exhaustive list) to the Luxembourg tax authorities for the purposes set out in the FATCA Law. Such information will be relayed by the Luxembourg tax authorities to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Holders of Notes qualifying as passive NFFEs undertake to inform their Controlling Persons, if applicable, of the processing of their information by the Issuer. Additionally, the Issuer is responsible for the processing of personal data and each holder of Notes has a right to access the data communicated to the Luxembourg tax authorities and to correct such data (if necessary). Any data obtained by the Issuer is to be processed in accordance with the applicable data protection legislation. Although the Issuer will attempt to satisfy any obligation imposed on it to avoid imposition of FATCA withholding tax, no assurance can be given that the Issuer will be able to satisfy these obligations. If the Issuer becomes subject to a withholding tax or penalties as result of the FATCA regime, the value of the Notes held by the holders of Notes may suffer material losses. The failure for the Issuer to obtain such information from each holder of Notes and to transmit it to the Luxembourg tax authorities may trigger the 30 per cent. withholding tax to be imposed on payments of U.S. source income as well as penalties. Any holder of Notes that fails to comply with the Issuer’s documentation requests may be charged with any taxes and/or penalties imposed on the Issuer as a result of such holder’s failure to provide the information and the Issuer may, in its sole discretion, redeem the Notes of such holder of Notes. Holders of Notes who invest through intermediaries are reminded to check if and how their intermediaries will comply with this U.S. withholding tax and reporting regime. Holders of Notes should consult a U.S. tax advisor or otherwise seek professional advice regarding the above requirements. _Common Reporting Standard_ Capitalised terms used in this section should have the meaning as set forth in the CRS Law (as defined below), unless otherwise provided herein.

Under the terms of the CRS Law, the Issuer may be treated as a Luxembourg Reporting Financial Institution. As such, the Issuer will be required to annually report to the Luxembourg tax authorities personal and financial information related, _inter alia, to the identification of, holdings by and payments made to (i) certain holders of Notes qualifying as Reportable Persons (as defined in the CRS Law) and (ii) Controlling Persons of passive non-financial entities (‘‘NFEs’’) which are themselves Reportable Persons. This information, as exhaustively set out in Annex I of the CRS Law (the ‘‘Information’’), will include personal data related to the Reportable Persons. The Issuer’s ability to satisfy its reporting obligations under the CRS Law will depend on each holder of Notes providing the Issuer with the Information, along with the required supporting documentary evidence. In this context, the holders of Notes are hereby informed that, as data controller, the Issuer will process the Information for the purposes as set out in the CRS Law. Holders of Notes qualifying as passive NFEs undertake to inform their Controlling Persons, if applicable, of the processing of their Information by the Issuer. 301 ----- Additionally, the Issuer is responsible for the processing of personal data and each holder of Notes has a right to access the data communicated to the Luxembourg tax authorities and to correct such data (if necessary). Any data obtained by the Issuer are to be processed in accordance with the applicable data protection legislation. The holders of Notes are further informed that the Information related to Reportable Persons will be disclosed to the Luxembourg tax authorities annually for the purposes set out in the CRS Law. The Luxembourg tax authorities will, under their own responsibility, eventually exchange the reported information to the competent authority of the Reportable Jurisdiction(s). In particular, Reportable Persons are informed that certain operations performed by them will be reported to them through the issuance of statements, and that part of this information will serve as a basis for the annual disclosure to the Luxembourg tax authorities. Similarly, the holders of Notes undertake to inform the Issuer within 30 days of receipt of these statements should any included personal data not be accurate. The holders of Notes further undertake to immediately inform the Issuer of, and provide the Issuer with all supporting documentary evidence of any changes related to the Information after occurrence of such changes. Although the Issuer will attempt to satisfy any obligation imposed on it to avoid any fines or penalties imposed by the CRS Law, no assurance can be given that the Issuer will be able to satisfy these obligations. If the Issuer becomes subject to a fine or penalty as a result of the CRS Law, the value of the Notes held by the holders of Notes may suffer material losses. Any holder of Notes that fails to comply with the Issuer’s Information or documentation requests may be held liable for penalties imposed on the Issuer as a result of such holder’s failure to provide the Information or subject to disclosure of the Information by the Issuer to the Luxembourg tax authorities and the Issuer may, in its sole discretion, redeem the Notes of such holder of Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

It does not purport to be a complete analysis of all possible tax situations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase, own or dispose of the Notes. It is included herein solely for preliminary information purposes. It is not intended to be, nor should it construed to be, legal or tax advice. This summary does not allow any conclusion to be drawn with respect to issues not specifically addressed. The following description of Luxembourg tax law is based on the Luxembourg law and regulations as in effect and as interpreted by the Luxembourg tax authorities on the date of the Offering Memorandum. These laws and interpretations are subject to change that may occur after such date, even with retroactive or retrospective effect. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their own tax advisers as to the particular tax consequences of subscribing, purchasing, holding and disposing the Notes, including the application and effect of any federal, state or local taxes under the tax laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and each country of which they are residents or citizens. Please be aware that the residence concept used under the respective headings below applies for Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes only. Any reference in the present section to a tax, duty, levy impost or other charge or withholding of a similar nature refers to Luxembourg tax law and/or concepts only. Also, please note that a reference to Luxembourg income tax encompasses corporate income tax (impˆot sur le revenu des collectivit´es), municipal business tax (impˆot commercial communal), a solidarity surcharge (contribution au fonds pour l’emploi) as well as personal income tax (impˆot sur le revenu). A corporate taxpayer may further be subject to net wealth tax (impˆot sur la fortune), as well as other duties, levies or taxes. Corporate income tax, municipal business tax as well as the solidarity surcharge invariably apply to most corporate taxpayers resident in Luxembourg for tax purposes. Individual taxpayers are generally subject to personal income tax and a solidarity surcharge. Under certain circumstances, where an individual taxpayer acts in the course of the management of a professional or business undertaking, municipal business tax may apply as well.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of paying such additional amounts, or making additional payments in redemption of the Note, does not result in the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury Regulations. This position will be based in part on our determination that, as of the date of the issuance of the Notes, the possibility that additional amounts will have to be paid is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations. Our determination that the Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which such U.S. holder acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a position contrary to that described above, a U.S. holder may be required to accrue interest income on its Notes based upon a comparable yield, regardless of its method of accounting. The ‘‘comparable yield’’ is the yield at which we would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no contingent 303 ----- payments, but with terms and conditions otherwise similar to those of the Notes. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Notes generally would be recharacterised as ordinary income. Each U.S. holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604
187,Offerings 2020.md,312,TAX CONSIDERATIONS,312.2,Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations,312.2.2,Original Issue Discount,"If the principal amount of the Notes exceeds the issue price of the Notes by a de minimis amount (which is generally [1]⁄4 of one per cent. of the principal amount multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity) or more, the excess will constitute OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. Holder of a Note that is issued with OID will be required to include the OID as ordinary interest income for U.S. federal income tax purposes as it accrues in accordance with a constant yield method based upon a compounding of interest, generally before receiving the cash to which that interest income is attributable and regardless of the U.S. Holder’s regular method of tax accounting. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors with regard to OID and the consequences of any Note being treated as issued with OID in their particular situations. In the event that the Notes are issued with OID, the amount of OID includible in income by a U.S. Holder is the sum of the ‘‘daily portions’’ of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. Holder holds the Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any ‘‘accrual period’’ a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note’s ‘‘adjusted issue price’’ at the beginning of such accrual period and its ‘‘yield to maturity,’’ determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual period generally is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period. The yield to maturity of a Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and interest payments to be made under the Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the Note. OID generally will be income from sources outside the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income. OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in euros and then translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described in the third paragraph under ‘‘—Payments of Stated Interest.’’ A U.S. Holder will recognize exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment received, determined based on the spot rate on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on a Note other than stated interest will be viewed first, as receipts of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and second, as receipts of principal. Exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S. source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

187,Offerings 2020.md,312,TAX CONSIDERATIONS,312.2,Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations,312.2.4,Payments of Stated Interest,"Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below with respect to the Notes, payments of stated interest on a Note (including any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes and without reduction for 304 ----- any amounts withheld) generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time that such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Payments of interest on the Notes will be denominated in euro. If you use the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the interest received on the Notes, determined by translating the euro received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. You will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euros so received. If you use the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or you are otherwise required to accrue interest prior to receipt), you may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to interest received on the Notes in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, you will be required to include in income for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the interest that has accrued during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods during which such interest accrued or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. holder, the part of the period within the taxable year. Under the second method, you may elect to translate interest income at the spot rate on: - the last day of the accrual period; - the last day of the portion of the accrual period within the applicable taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable year; or - the date the stated interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual period. This election will apply to all debt obligations you hold from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. You should consult your own tax advisor as to the advisability of making the above election. Whether or not such election is made, upon receipt of an interest payment on a Note (including, upon the sale of a Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest previously included in income), you will recognize U.S. source ordinary income or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the euros received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income you previously included in income with respect to such payment. This exchange gain or loss will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a U.S. Holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations. Stated interest income on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and generally will be considered ‘‘passive category income’’ in computing the foreign tax credit. The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules that depend on a U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances.

A U.S. Holder’s_ adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the cost of the Note to such U.S. Holder, increased by any OID accrued by such U.S. Holder with respect to the Note. The amount realized by a U.S. Holder is the sum of the cash plus the fair market value of all other property received on the sale or other taxable disposition. If a U.S. Holder receives foreign currency on such sale or other taxable disposition, the amount realized will generally be based on the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of disposition. In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. Holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency by 305 ----- translating such amount at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders in regard to the purchase or disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. Holder that does not make the special election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally be its cost for the Note. The cost of a Note purchased with foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price determined based on the spot rate on the date of purchase. If the applicable Note is treated as traded on an established securities market and the relevant U.S. Holder is either a cash basis taxpayer or an accrual basis taxpayer who has made the special election described above, such U.S. Holder will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of such Note by translating the amount paid at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase. The conversion of U.S. dollars to a foreign currency and the immediate use of that currency to purchase a Note generally will not result in taxable gain or loss for a U.S. Holder. Gain or loss recognized on the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as interest income or expense. Such gain or loss generally will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s euro purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date principal is received from the Issuer or the U.S. Holder disposes of the Note, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s euro purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date the U.S. Holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon a sale or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and, if any, accrued OID, which will be treated as discussed above under ‘‘—Payments of Stated Interest’’ or ‘‘—Original _Issue Discount,’’ as applicable. However, upon a sale or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder_ will recognize any exchange gain or loss (including with respect to accrued stated interest and accrued OID, if any) only to the extent of total gain or loss realized by such U.S. Holder on such disposition. Gain or loss a U.S. Holder recognizes on the sale or other taxable disposition of the Notes in excess of exchange gain or loss attributable to such disposition generally will be U.S. source capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if a U.S. Holder has held the Notes for more than one year. For non-corporate U.S. Holders, long-term capital gains are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final Treasury Regulations defining foreign passthru payments are filed with the Federal Register generally would be ‘‘grandfathered’’ from FATCA unless ‘‘materially modified’’ (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) after such date. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA would apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after expiration of the grandfather period. However, if Additional Notes are issued after the expiration of the grandfather period in other than a ‘‘qualified reopening’’ (as defined in applicable Treasury Regulations) and are not distinguishable from the original Notes, then withholding agents may treat both the original Notes and Additional Notes as subject to withholding under FATCA. Non-U.S. governments have entered into agreements with the United States (and additional non-U.S. governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein.

187,Offerings 2020.md,568,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY,568.1,England and Wales,568.1.1,Administration,"The U.K. Insolvency Act 1986 (the ‘‘Insolvency Act’’) empowers English courts to make an administration order in respect of a company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales or a company with its ‘‘centre of main interests’’ or an ‘‘establishment’’ in England and Wales or indeed any company incorporated in an EEA member state in certain circumstances and provided rules of private international law (including as to the entity’s connection to the jurisdiction) are complied with. Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that the relevant company is or is likely to become ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ and that the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a ‘‘cash flow’’ basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a ‘‘balance sheet’’ basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), as per Section 123 of the Insolvency Act. Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 21 days of service or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order). Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, an English company, the directors of such company or the holder of a qualifying floating charge (for further detail on what constitutes a qualifying floating charge, see ‘‘—Administrative Receivership’’ below) where the floating charge has become enforceable, may also appoint an administrator through an out of court process, subject to certain exceptions pursuant to the Insolvency Act. Note that different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor. The purpose of an administration comprises three objectives, each of which must be considered successively to determine whether it is reasonable to put the company into administration: rescuing the company as a going-concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up (without first being in administration) or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (see ‘‘—Onset of Insolvency’’ below). An administrator must attempt to achieve the objectives of administration in order, unless he thinks it is not reasonably practicable to achieve the primary objective, or that the secondary objective would achieve a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole. The administrator cannot pursue the third objective unless he thinks either the first or the second objective is unachievable and that it will not unnecessarily harm the interests of the creditors of the company as a whole to pursue the third objective. Certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed and no step may be taken to enforce security over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court. The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. Accordingly, if the English Guarantors were to enter into administration, the Notes, the English Guarantee and the Collateral, as applicable, may not be enforceable while the relevant company was in administration without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent, as applicable, would obtain such permission of the court or consent of the administrator. In addition, an administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to realise their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. 313 ----- This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a ‘‘security financial collateral agreement’’ (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the ‘‘Financial Collateral Regulations’’). If an English company were to enter administration, it is possible that, to the extent such security is a financial collateral arrangement, the security granted by it or the guarantee granted by it would be enforceable while it is in administration without leave of the court or consent of the administrators.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

That party will also be able to appoint an administrative receiver if the security document pre-dates 15 September 2003 or the qualifying floating charge falls within one of the exceptions under the Insolvency Act (as amended by the Enterprise Act 2002) to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which: (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it (paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 of the Insolvency Act); (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. A party will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms of security, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant company and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to ‘‘capital market arrangements’’ (as defined in the Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50 million for the relevant English company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a ‘‘capital markets investment’’ (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, and generally includes rated, listed or traded debt instruments, and debt instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is invalid. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of part of the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an appointment to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator. An administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge which falls within the definition of a ‘‘security financial collateral arrangement’’, as per Reg. 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations (see ‘‘Administration’’ above). The primary duty of the fixed charge receiver is to realise the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning (s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor (although the receiver owes the chargor a duty to act in good faith during the course of his appointment). This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realising the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realisations made of the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor). 314 ----- To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallised floating charge, amounts will be deducted from the proceeds of the realisation of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors (see ‘‘Fixed versus floating charges’’ below).",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court and (b) members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members. The difference between the two latter proceedings is the solvency of the company in question; in a members’ voluntary liquidation, the directors of the company swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following 12 months. The primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). A creditor’s voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, but once in place is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced from the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose. In the context of a voluntary winding-up however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the member’s resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up—it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or shareholder of the company, to apply for a stay. This is important because it means secured creditors can go ahead and enforce their security. A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions (see ‘‘Avoidance of Transactions’’ below).",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, among other things, the company’s ‘‘centre of main interests’’ is in England and Wales, the company’s finance documents are English law-governed, or the company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in any given case. Before the court considers whether or not to sanction a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75 per cent. or more by value of those creditors 315 ----- present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favour of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approved thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made to the scheme or decline to sanction the scheme. Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings (though see ‘‘Government Proposal for Changes’’ below).",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

Under the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016, creditors are placed into different classes and, with the exceptions and adjustments noted below, the proceeds from the realisation of the insolvent company’s property is applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a _pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. Contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or administration are only respected to the extent they fall within the definition of ‘‘mutual dealing’’ as applied by the mandatory insolvency set-off regime. This regime sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and only the resulting net balance is either provable by the creditor in the administration or liquidation of the company (if amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if amounts remain due to the company). The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): - _First ranking: holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in specific assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor but only to the extent the realizations from those secured assets or with respect to the asset in which they have a proprietary interest account for the relevant indebtedness; - _Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate incurred during the relevant insolvency proceedings (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are-paid); - _Third ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; and (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally. Secondary preferential debts are currently limited to certain categories of bank account deposits. The UK government has confirmed its intention in the Finance Bill 2020 that from 1 December 2020 secondary preferential debts will include claims by HMRC in respect of taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student loan repayments), employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally after the ordinary preferential debts; - _Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets, according to the priority of their security.

It will only be a preference if at the time of the transaction or in consequence of the transaction the English company is unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction or becomes unable to pay its debts as a result (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of six months (if the beneficiary is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the English company gives the preference ending with the onset of insolvency.

Only with prior approval of the court can an administrator deal with property subject to a fixed charge provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the administration’s purpose and that the administrator apply the gross proceeds from the disposal of the property in question towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge holder. There is a possibility that a court could find that some or all of the fixed security interests expressed to be created by the security documents governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges as the 320 ----- description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the security holder in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. If any fixed security interests are recharacterised as floating security interests: (a) the proceeds of those assets could be applied in meeting other liabilities of the company in priority to the claims of the purported fixed charge holder in insolvency proceedings and (b) it is possible that any purported floating charge security may no longer relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant company and therefore may not constitute a ‘‘qualifying floating charge.’’ See also ‘‘—Administrative _Receivership.’’_",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that these documents do not allow such an action, there is a risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third-parties if they are dealing with the English Guarantors in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for the English Guarantors by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act provides that a director must act in the way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the English Guarantors for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when directors’ duties to creditors arise, the Court of Appeal has recently held that the shift takes place when the directors know, or should know, that the company in question is or is likely to become insolvent, with ‘‘likely’’ in this context meaning ‘‘probable’’.

Such security, if not registered within the 21-day period, will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator or a creditor of the company. When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become immediately payable. In the event that the relevant security document is not registered, the company may be required to enter into a new security document and register it with Companies House within 21-days of its creation. Alternatively, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order allowing the charge to be registered after the 21-day period has expired. An application for such an order can be made by the company or by any person interested in the relevant security. The court will grant leave to register the security out of time if it considers it ‘‘just and expedient’’ to do so, and will have particular regard to whether the failure to register was merely accidental and whether a late registration will prejudice the 321 ----- position of creditors or shareholders.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the British government indicated in March 2020 that these proposed reforms would be fast tracked. However, it is still not yet known when the proposals will be introduced. The proposals include the following: _Moratorium Proposal_ The Government proposed a new stand-alone moratorium to facilitate company restructurings. The Government intends that entry into a moratorium will be similar to the current out of court administrator appointment procedure, i.e., filing papers at court. A ‘‘moratorium monitor’’ (the ‘‘Monitor’’) (an insolvency practitioner and officer of the court) will file their consent to act and confirm that they have assessed the company’s eligibility and that all moratorium qualifying conditions are satisfied. Costs incurred during a moratorium will be treated in the same way as expenses in an administration. Where a company exits a moratorium and subsequently enters administration or liquidation, any unpaid moratorium costs will have super-priority over any costs or claims in the administration or liquidation, including the expense of those later procedures. The moratorium is intended to enable the company to reach an agreement with creditors and the Monitor will be expected to access whether, on the balance of probabilities, a rescue deal is more likely than not to be achieved. Eligibility for the moratorium will exclude companies that are already insolvent. The qualifying test will be one of prospective insolvency, based upon the requirement that a company will become insolvent if action is not taken, and it will be for the proposed Monitor to assess whether the criterion is met. The Government proposed that a company which has entered into a moratorium, administration or company voluntary arrangement on the last twelve months should not qualify for a moratorium. In addition, it is proposed that certain of the categories of companies currently excluded from the small companies company voluntary arrangement moratorium (see ‘‘—Company Voluntary Arrangements’’ above) (including those ‘‘excluded’’ as parties to capital markets arrangements) will be ineligible. A company must also have sufficient funds available to carry on its business during a moratorium, meeting current obligations as and when they fall due as well as any new obligations incurred in the moratorium. The Government’s proposal allows the moratorium to last for an initial period of 28 days, which may be extended for a further 28 days by the company. Where an extension is proposed, the Monitor must confirm that the qualifying conditions continue to be met. Further extensions (beyond 56 days) will be available but may only be done where there remains a good prospect of achieving a better outcome for creditors than might otherwise be possible. Such extensions must be approved by creditors, both secured and unsecured. The required threshold for approval will be more than 50 per cent. of secured and 50 per cent. of unsecured creditors (both by value). The Government intends to allow creditors to challenge the moratorium, whether on the grounds of the qualifying conditions not being met (or the company being ineligible) or unfair prejudice to creditors, at any time during the moratorium. Where the Monitor concludes that a company no longer meets the qualifying conditions, the company will be required immediately to commence termination of the moratorium. 323 ----- The Government proposed a repeal of the existing small companies company voluntary arrangement moratorium (see ‘‘—Company Voluntary Arrangements’’ above). _Ipso Facto Clauses to be Prohibited_ The government proposed a prohibition on the enforcement of termination clauses by a supplier in contracts for goods and services which are based on a formal insolvency procedure. It has also indicated that certain types of financial products and services shall be exempt from the prohibition, but the scope and details of the exemptions are not yet available. _Restructuring Plan Proposal_ The Government also proposed the creation of a new restructuring process, similar to a scheme of arrangement but with an ability for cross-class cram-down. This standalone restructuring option will be available to all companies except those eligible for the small companies company voluntary arrangement moratorium (see ‘‘—Company Voluntary Arrangements’’ above) and certain financial market participants. The process will closely resemble that of schemes where a restructuring plan proposal will be sent to creditors and shareholders and filed at court. The restructuring plan proposal has no financial eligibility criteria and will therefore be available as an option to both solvent and insolvent companies (in the latter case, the plan would be proposed by the incumbent insolvency practitioner). At a first hearing, the court will examine the classes of creditors and shareholders as defined by the company. Challenges to classes can be made at the first court hearing, in addition to creditors being able to put forward counter-proposals, which can be voted on by creditors (and shareholders). Subject to the requisite voting thresholds being met and the rules for imposing a cross-class cram-down being complied with, the court will schedule a second hearing. At a second hearing, the court will consider if the necessary requirements have been met and will decide whether the restructuring plan is to be permitted and, as a result, binding on affected creditors and shareholders. Necessary information is likely to be included in a form of explanatory statement (similar to that used in schemes). A restructuring plan confirmed by the court will be binding on all affected parties. Parties’ rights following confirmation of a restructuring plan will be as provided for in the plan and any previous rights will be extinguished. If a company subsequently entered an insolvency procedure after the failure of a restructuring plan, the rights and claims of any creditors bound by the failed plan would be as set out in the plan. Any debt forgiveness would therefore be binding in the subsequent insolvency. The restructuring plan will allow cross-class cram-down on both secured and unsecured creditors. The voting threshold requires 75 per cent. by value of those creditors voting in each class to vote in favour of a restructuring plan. There is also an additional provision that more than half of the total value of unconnected creditors vote in favour. There is no numerosity requirement but at least one class of impaired creditors (that is, creditors who will not receive payment in full under the restructuring plan) class must vote in favour, for cross-class cram-down to be confirmed by the court. In addition, there will also be an absolute priority rule whereby a dissenting class of creditors must be satisfied in full before a more junior class may receive any distribution. However, there will be sufficient flexibility to allow departure from this rule (with the court’s sanction) where the departure is vital to agreeing an effective and workable restructuring plan. The court’s discretion on absolute priority will be in addition to its general discretion to sanction a plan on just and equitable grounds. In an effort to avoid valuation disputes, there will be a flexible valuation test based on the ‘next best alternative’ for creditors. This is intended to differentiate the situations where administration (and a higher return) might be feasible from those cases where liquidation would only be the likely alternative. However, it should be noted that the legislation for these proposal reforms has not yet been submitted to the U.K. Parliament and, as such, there is no certainty as to the exact form these proposed reforms will take. 324 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,604
187,Offerings 2020.md,568,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY,568.1,England and Wales,568.1.24,,"Following a national referendum in June 2016, the United Kingdom exercised its right pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union to initiate a process to withdraw from the European Union. Please note that the information contained in this section will be subject to change in light of the arrangements to be put in place to effect the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union. As such arrangements have not yet been determined, the following section outlines the relevant insolvency law considerations in England and Wales as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. Certain Guarantors are incorporated under English law and, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Indenture and the Notes, are obliged to grant certain fixed and floating security interests in respect of the Notes and its Guarantees (the ‘‘English Guarantors’’). Therefore, any insolvency proceedings with respect to the English Guarantors would likely proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency laws. However, pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast) (the ‘‘EU _Insolvency Regulation’’), where a company incorporated under English law has its ‘‘centre of main interests’’_ in a member state of the EU other than the U.K., then the main insolvency proceedings for that company may be opened and subject to the laws of that member state (see ‘‘—European Union’’ below) and English courts (or the courts of other parts of the United Kingdom) will only have jurisdiction to open secondary insolvency proceedings with respect to the English Guarantors if they are found to have an ‘‘establishment’’ in England and the effects of those proceedings will be limited to the assets of the English Guarantors located in England. The UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the ‘‘Model Law’’) (which has been implemented in the United Kingdom by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 and in a number of other jurisdictions), provides for recognition of insolvency proceedings in other jurisdictions as either foreign main or foreign non-main proceedings. English insolvency proceedings in relation to the English Guarantors may be recognized as foreign main proceedings in other jurisdictions which have implemented the Model Law if the English Guarantors have their respective ‘‘centre of main interests’’ in England. If the English Guarantors are found to have their respective ‘‘centre of main interests’’ in a place other than England, the English insolvency proceedings may only be afforded recognition as foreign non-main proceedings provided that the English Guarantors are found to have an establishment in England (meaning that it has a place of operations in England and carries out non-transitory economic activities with human means and assets or services). In that case, the main insolvency proceedings with respect to the English Guarantors will occur in the place in which the English Guarantors are found to have their respective ‘‘centre of main interests’’. In case of any conflict, the EU Insolvency Regulation will prevail over the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006. English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In the event that the English Guarantors experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. The obligations under the Notes are guaranteed by the Guarantees and secured by security interests over the Collateral. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a Guarantee against the English Guarantors and the enforceability of security interests over the Collateral. 312 ----- The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations on the Guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights against an English Guarantor under the Guarantees and/or the Collateral securing the Notes and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of the English Guarantors.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

The petition for bankruptcy must be filed with the bankruptcy court in the district in which the debtor operates his business. The bankruptcy court does not publish information on the receipt of the petition for bankruptcy, but any person having a legal interest is entitled to receive information as to whether and when a debtor has filed a petition for bankruptcy (debtor’s own petition). The bankruptcy court does not provide information on a creditor’s petition for bankruptcy. A creditor cannot demand that the debtor be declared bankrupt if the creditor’s claim is secured by adequate security. In this context, adequate security means a security right expected to provide full coverage for the creditor. If the security is voidable in bankruptcy or the act of perfection has not been performed, the creditor does not have adequate security. The creditor is not required to have a basis of execution for his claim, e.g., a judgment in a civil case, a settlement in-court or a signed debt instrument or mortgage. Further, the creditor’s claim does not have to be due for payment to form basis of a petition for bankruptcy. However, the creditor must have a legal interest in the debtor’s estate being administered in bankruptcy. As a result, not all claims that have not become due for payment may form basis of a petition for bankruptcy. Depending on the circumstances, an overdraft facility still being in force or a repayment arrangement being observed by the debtor may result in the creditor’s petition being rejected. The requirement for legal interest also means that in general the bankruptcy court will reject a creditor’s petition for bankruptcy if it is clear in advance that he will not receive any dividend in case of bankruptcy. It should be noted, however, that if there is probable cause to believe that the debtor has made avoidable transactions, the creditor may have the required legal interest in the bankruptcy even if the debtor does not have substantial assets. In that case, the creditor must be able to substantiate the avoidable transactions with some degree of certainty. A creditor having filed a petition for bankruptcy against a debtor will be liable to pay damages if the debtor suffers a loss or to pay compensation for injury to the debtor’s reputation if the bankruptcy conditions, the insolvency requirement, are not fulfilled or if the claim does not exist. The petitioner must provide security for the expenses relating to the administration of the estate. In practice, the bankruptcy court demands security in the amount of DKK 30,000 (DKK 40,000 if subject to the jurisdiction of the Commercial and Maritime Court). If the debtor has filed the petition for bankruptcy, the security must be provided by the funds of the bankruptcy estate. 325 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

The trustee is not required to be an attorney, but in practice that is always the case. The trustee must comply with the disqualification rules of the Danish Insolvency Act. Consequently, the trustee must not be the debtor’s related party or depending on the debtor, and there must not be any doubt as to whether the trustee is impartial. As a general rule, the debtor’s own attorney is prevented from being appointed as trustee due to the disqualification rules. The bankruptcy court may also find that a person being a member of the board of directors of the debtor’s business or a person being the debtor’s advisor cannot be appointed as trustee. Likewise, any person whom the bankruptcy estate is expected to make claims against, e.g., an avoidance claim or otherwise, will most likely be deemed to have a personal interest in the administration of the estate and would therefore not meet these requirements. The trustee will make all decisions concerning the administration of the bankruptcy estate, and he represents the estate in every respect.

The petition for in-court restructuring must be filed with the bankruptcy court in the district in which the debtor operates his business. In-court restructuring proceedings may only be commenced if the debtor is insolvent (same as described above with respect to bankruptcy). If this criterion is fulfilled, the bankruptcy court will immediately appoint a restructuring administrator and a restructuring accountant to oversee the restructuring of the company. The management continues to operate the company, but any material transactions may not be carried out without the prior approval of the restructuring administrator. Payment of creditors may only be done in accordance with the priority of claims as described below. The in-court restructuring of a company must achieve one or more of the following statutory objectives: (1) the in-court restructuring of the business by means of a compulsory composition; (2) the termination of the business of the company by transferring the business; or (3) any combination of (1) and (2). The aim of a restructuring is therefore to salvage the business itself, but not necessarily thereby saving the company. The restructuring administrator will propose a restructuring plan, and creditors with a legal interest who attend the voting meeting at the court can vote for or against the proposed restructuring plan.

Transactions damaging the estate are for example gifts (including sale of assets at undervalue), renunciations of inheritance or the payment of excessive salary or pension to related parties. Transactions 326 ----- favouring creditors without observing the ranking of creditors are for example payment by unusual means of payment, payments before due date, payments having significantly impaired the debtor’s ability to pay or the provision of security for prior debts. Special attention is given to the avoidance rule on security for prior debts and the general avoidance rule in the following paragraphs. Any security interest created and perfected within a three-month reference period prior to the bankruptcy and which has not been created prior to, or simultaneously with, the debt obligations which it secures, or which is not perfected without undue delay after the creation of such debt obligations may be subject to an avoidance claim from the estate. Danish insolvency law operates with a general avoidance rule, which stipulates that an action which unduly benefits a single creditor to the detriment of the other creditors, or whereby the company’s assets are prevented from serving the purpose of satisfying the creditors, or whereby the company’s debt is increased to the detriment of the creditors, may be declared void if the company was or because of the action became insolvent, and the benefitted party knew or ought to have known about the company’s insolvency and the circumstances that made the action improper. Generally, only transactions which are contrary to common norms of correct and decent business behaviour will be deemed improper. Improper behaviour is normally related to a breach of the purpose of insolvency proceedings, which typically is the situation where a creditor should have realised that a given transaction would deprive the other creditors of their right to fulfilment of their claims. The usual reference period is three months prior to the filing date, which is extended to up to 24 months for transactions with parties closely related to the company, and the general avoidance rule (as described above) provides for a theoretically unlimited avoidance period with respect to improper transactions. The requirement that the company must have been in an uninterrupted insolvent state throughout the entire period does, however, limit the practical length of the reference period.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

The trustee registers all claims and examines whether they are legitimate and entitle the creditor to receive dividend. The ranking of creditors is described in the Danish Insolvency Act which determines the order in which claims against the estate or the debtor are settled. All higher-ranking claims must be satisfied in full before the next level will be entitled to dividend, i.e., a water fall scheme. The ranking of creditors is as follows: - Firstly: costs or claims incurred in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings or claims according to agreements upheld by the estate; - Secondly: reasonable claims in connection with any prior attempted restructuring proceedings; - Thirdly: claims for wages or salaries payable; - Fourthly: claims of suppliers for certain indirect taxes; - Fifthly: unsecured claims (all other claims except for deferred claims); and - Sixthly: deferred claims (interest, fines, promises of gifts and subordinate loan capital). Secured claims are handled separately from the water fall and the secured claim is paid using the proceeds from the collateral that secures the claim.

However the presumption only applies if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three month period prior to the request for opening insolvency proceedings. The European Court of Justice has ruled that a debtor company’s main centre of interests must be determined by attaching greater importance to the place of the company’s central administration, as may be established by objective factors which are ascertainable by third-parties. Where the bodies responsible for the management and supervision of a company are in the same place as its registered office and the management decisions of the company are taken, in a manner that is ascertainable by third-parties, in that place, the presumption, that the centre of the company’s main interests is located in that place, shall be irrebuttable. Where a company’s central administration is, however, not in the same place as its registered office, the presence of company assets and existence of contracts for the financial exploitation of those assets in a Member State other than that in which the registered office is situated cannot be regarded as sufficient factors to rebut the abovementioned presumption, unless a comprehensive assessment of all relevant factors makes it possible to establish, in a manner that is ascertainable by third-parties, that the company’s actual centre of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. The factors to be taken into account include, in particular, all the places in which it holds assets, in so far as they are ascertainable by third-parties. The EU Insolvency Regulation also sets out, at paragraph 30 of the Preamble, examples of where a presumption as to a company’s ‘‘centre of main interests’’ may be rebutted. The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings which are collective insolvency proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation by reference to each applicable Member State. If the centre of main interests of a company is and remains located in a Member State (other than Denmark), the main insolvency proceedings in respect of such company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. If the ‘‘centre of main interests’’ of a debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open ‘‘territorial proceedings’’ only in the event that such debtor has an ‘‘establishment’’ in the territory of such other Member State. An ‘‘establishment’’ is defined to mean any place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to 330 ----- the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. Territorial proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation and, for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding-up proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings and which will usually convert to secondary proceedings on the opening of the main proceedings. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor located in the territory of such other Member State. If the company does not have an establishment in any other Member State, no court of any other Member State has jurisdiction to open territorial proceedings in respect of such company under the EU Insolvency Regulation. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or territorial proceedings, such proceedings will always, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the _lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court which has assumed jurisdiction for the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the Member State in which the company has its centre of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be opened in another Member State (other than Denmark) where the company has an establishment and either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the company’s centre of main interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (ii) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognise the judgment of the court opening main proceedings and give the same effect to the order in the other relevant Member States so long as no secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings have been opened there. Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency officeholder appointed by the court in the Member State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State in another Member State (other than Denmark) (such as to remove assets of the company from that other Member State). These powers are subject to certain limitations (e.g., the powers are available provided that no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other Member State nor has any preservation measure to the contrary been taken there further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the company has assets). In order to avoid the opening of secondary proceedings, the insolvency practitioner in the main proceedings may also give a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary proceedings could be opened that, when distributing assets or realisation proceeds, it will comply with the distribution and priority rights under national law that creditors would have if secondary proceedings were opened in that Member State. This, however, is subject to a ‘‘qualified majority’’ (as defined under national law) of known local creditors (being creditors whose claims against a debtor arose from or in connection with the operation of an establishment situated in a Member State other than the Member State in which the debtor’s ‘‘centre of main interests’’ is located) approving the undertaking. The law applicable to the distribution of proceeds and ranking of claims is also the law of the state where secondary proceedings are opened. In addition, the concept of ‘‘group coordination proceedings’’ has been introduced in the EU Insolvency Regulation with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of companies. Under Article 61 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation in group coordination proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan, however, is voluntary. In the event that the Issuer or any Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings will be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organised or operate may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another. 331 ----- The European Commission may, from time to time, publish amendments to the EU Insolvency Regulation which, once enacted, might alter the manner in which the test for determining where a company has its ‘‘centre of main interests’’ might be applied during the term of the Notes. The Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, could upon implementation in the Member States entail certain changes to the legislation of the Member States within the scope of the directive.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

KG (collectively, the ‘‘German Security Providers’’, and, together with the German Guarantors, the ‘‘German Security Grantors’’ are incorporated in the form of limited liability companies (Gesellschaft mit beschr¨ankter Haftung) (‘‘GmbH’’). Consequently, the granting of the Guarantees and/or Collateral by each of the German Security Grantors is subject to certain capital maintenance rules under the German Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschr¨ankter Haftung) (‘‘GmbHG’’). These provisions would also apply to any future German Security Grantor in the form of a GmbH or a partnership with a limited liability company as unlimited liable partner (e.g., GmbH & Co. KG). Therefore, in order to enable the German Security Grantor to grant guarantees and/or security interests securing liabilities of the Issuer without the risk of violating German capital maintenance provisions and to protect management from personal liability, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, notes, guarantees and security documents to contain ‘‘limitation language’’ in relation to subsidiaries, a GmbH or a partnership with a GmbH as an unlimited liable partner incorporated or established in Germany. Pursuant to such limitation language, the enforcement of the Guarantee and/or security interest given by each of the German Security Grantor will be limited, reflecting the requirement under the capital maintenance rules imposed by Sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG if and to the extent payments under any such Guarantee would cause a German Security Grantor’s net assets to fall below the amount of its registered share capital (Stammkapital) or, if the net assets of the German Security Grantor are already less than the stated share capital, cause the net assets to be further reduced or if and to the extent payments under any Guarantee would deprive the German Security Grantor of the liquidity necessary to fulfil its financial liabilities to its creditors. These limitations would, to the extent applicable, restrict the enforcement of the relevant Guarantee. You may not be able to enforce the Guarantees or security interests granted by the German Security Grantor due to restrictions on enforcement contained in German corporate and other law. Also, German capital maintenance and liquidity maintenance rules are subject to evolving court decisions on an ongoing basis (see, for example, the more recent decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) dated 21 March 2017, file no. II ZR 93/16, regarding the preservation of the share capital). We cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of the German Security Grantor, which can negatively affect the ability of the German Guarantors to make payments on the Guarantee. In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding section 64 sentence 3 of the GmbHG (i.e., a situation where a managing director makes a payment to the GmbH’s shareholder which inevitably leads to the illiquidity of the GmbH) or a so-called ‘‘destructive interference’’ (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives a German limited liability company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of the Guarantees or security interests granted by the German Security Grantor. In such a case, the amount of proceeds to be realised in an enforcement process may be (further) reduced (down to zero). Furthermore, according to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral (including a guarantee) by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts 332 ----- may apply this case law with respect to the granting of the Guarantees and/or security interests by the German Security Grantor. Furthermore, the beneficiary (e.g., a holder of Notes) of a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of the grantor of the Guarantees and/or Collateral could, moreover, become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee and/or security interests was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

Such accessory security interests (akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) (i) will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claim is settled, discharged or novated, (ii) may not be assigned independently, but would automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured claim is assigned and (iii) may only be granted to the creditor of a claim to be secured by the accessory security interest. The accessory security interests will be granted to the Security Agent. The Security Agent is however not a creditor under the Notes. The Holders on the other hand are creditors under the Notes and the Guarantees but no direct beneficiaries of the security interests. In order to allow the Holders to benefit from the pledges, such pledges are granted to the Security Agent as security for Parallel Debt created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favour of the Security Agent rather than secure the Holders’ claims under the Notes directly. The Parallel Debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the creditors under the Principal Obligations, and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the Parallel Debt, a claim against the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes, the legal concept of creating parallel debt obligations has, to our knowledge, not yet been tested before a German court. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that such concept will not be recognized by German courts or that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of invalidity and unenforceability of pledges. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the collateral may be restricted. Moreover, the Security Agent holds the pledges in trust. This means that in the case of an insolvency of the Security Agent, the insolvency administrator over the insolvency estate of the Security Agent may successfully claim that there is no separation right (Aussonderungsrecht) of the Holders with respect to the secured claims. As a consequence the secured claims (including the parallel debt) and the accessory security rights would remain with the (then insolvent) Security Agent.

Such proceedings would then be governed by German law. However, where a German company conducts business in more than one member state of the EU, the jurisdiction of the German courts may be limited if the company’s ‘‘centre of main interests’’ is found to be in a member state other than Germany or it maintains an ‘‘establishment’’ within the meaning of Art. 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation in another member state (other than Denmark). Pursuant to Article 3 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, in the case of a secondary insolvency proceeding in another member state, assets that would otherwise be allocated to the main office may be allocated to the relevant establishment and form part of such secondary insolvency proceedings. This issue is to be determined at the time when the application for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzer¨offnungsantrag) is filed. Hence, in the event of an insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider organised under the laws of Germany and/or having its centre of main interests in Germany (a ‘‘German Domiciled Security Grantor’’), main insolvency proceedings would most likely be initiated in Germany. Such proceedings would then be governed by German law. See also ‘‘— _European Union.’’_ 333 ----- The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) may not be as favourable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including, _inter alia, in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, creditor’s reorganisation, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit your ability to recover payments due on the Notes. Proceedings in this jurisdiction are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of their rights. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany. Insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex officio, but require that the debtor and/or a creditor files an application for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzer¨offnungsantrag). Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor (a) in the event of over-indebtedness (Uberschuldung[¨] ) of the debtor (where its liabilities exceed the value of its assets, even if the debtor has sufficient liquidity to meet its current obligations), unless, based on the prevailing circumstances, a continuation of the business as a going-concern is predominantly likely (¨uberwiegend wahrscheinlich), or (b) in the event of illiquidity (Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit) of the debtor, meaning that the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due. If a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschr¨ankter Haftung) or any company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder finds itself in a situation of illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, the managing directors of such company are obliged to file for insolvency without delay but not later than three weeks after such illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness was established (duty to file for opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzantragspflicht)). In addition, only the debtor can file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in case of impending illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit), if there is the imminent risk for the company of being unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due, whereas impending illiquidity does not give rise to an obligation for the management of the debtor to file for insolvency proceedings. If a company faces imminent illiquidity and/or is over-indebted but not yet illiquid it may also file for preliminary ‘‘debtor-in-possession’’ moratorium proceedings (‘‘Schutzschirmverfahren’’) unless—from a third-party perspective—there is no reasonable chance for a successful restructuring. The Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for Insolvency and to Limit Directors’ Liability in the Case of Insolvency Caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic, which was adopted on 27 March 2020 (the ‘‘COVInsAG’’), provides for a suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency until 30 September 2020. The suspension applies unless the insolvency is not caused by consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic or there is no prospect of remedying the existing illiquidity (Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit). If the debtor was able to pay its debts on 31 December 2019—so that the debtor was not illiquid (zahlungsunf¨ahig)—it is assumed that the insolvency was caused by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and that there are prospects of remedying an existing illiquiditity (Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit). The COVInsAG also provides that insolvency proceedings based on creditors’ insolvency filings in the period from 28 March 2020 to 28 June 2020 can only be opened if the event of illiquidity or over-indebtedness already existed on 1 March 2020. However, the Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection will be authorized by regulation to extend the suspensions until 31 March 2021 if this appears to be necessary due to the continuing demand for available public aid, ongoing financing difficulties, or other circumstances. The insolvency proceedings are supervised by the competent insolvency court, which monitors the due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary measures (vorl¨aufige Maßnahmen) to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzer¨offnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings and usually appoints a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorl¨aufiger Insolvenzverwalter), unless the debtor has petitioned for debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung)—an insolvency process in which the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter) provided that no circumstances are known which lead to the expectation that debtor-in-possession status will place the creditors at a disadvantage. The rights and duties of the preliminary administrator depend on the decision of the court. The duties of the preliminary administrator may be, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor’s property and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, even the right to manage and dispose of the business and assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency administrator. If a company files for preliminary ‘‘debtor-in-possession’’ moratorium proceedings, the court will appoint a preliminary trustee (vorl¨aufiger 334 ----- _Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immoveable assets). The court_ may also resolve other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months. During that period, the debtor shall prepare an insolvency plan which ideally will be implemented in ‘‘debtor-in-possession’’ proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after main insolvency proceedings have been opened. During preliminary proceedings the insolvency court must or may appoint a ‘‘preliminary creditors’ _committee’’ (vorl¨aufiger Gl¨aubigerausschuss) to form a view on a petition for debtor-in-possession status or_ on the profile of the (preliminary) insolvency administrator to be appointed or even to make a suggestion for a particular individual to be appointed by the court. A preliminary creditors’ committee has to be set up if the debtor satisfies two of the following three requirements: (i) a balance sheet total in excess of A6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over-indebted), (ii) revenues of at least A12,000,000 in the twelve months prior to the last balance sheet date and/or (iii) an annual average of 50 or more employees. The preliminary creditor’s committee will be able to participate in certain important insolvency court decisions. It will have, for example, the power to influence the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator or an insolvency administrator (vorl¨aufiger _Insolvenzverwalter_ _or _Insolvenzverwalter), court orders for ‘‘debtor-in-possession’’ proceedings (Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung),_ and appointment of a preliminary custodian (vorl¨aufiger Sachwalter). In case the members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an individual, such suggestion is binding on the court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and impartial). To ensure that the preliminary creditors’ committee reflects the interests of all creditor constituencies, it may comprise a representative of the secured creditors, one for the large creditors and one for the small creditors as well as one for the employees. The court orders the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Er¨offnungsbeschluss) if certain requirements are met, in particular if (i) the debtor is in a situation of impending illiquidity (if the petition has been filed by the debtor) or illiquidity and/or over-indebted and (ii) there are sufficient assets (Insolvenzmasse) to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third-parties (for instance, creditors) advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels _Masse)._ Upon the opening of main insolvency proceedings, the right to manage and dispose of the business and assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter), who is appointed by the insolvency court unless debtor-in-possession (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In addition, the insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s business. These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency administrator or caused by the continuing of debtor’s business qualify as preferential claims against the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are preferred to any insolvency claims of unsecured creditors (this also includes such portion of an in rem secured creditor’s claim which exceeds the amount obtained through a disposal of the relevant collateral). In the absence of a debtor-in-possession status, the right to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgl¨aubiger) only being entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gl¨aubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (a) a simple majority of votes cast (by head count and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favour of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (b) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder (i.e., sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and impartial). Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or ‘‘escape clauses’’ entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene K¨undigungsrechte _oder L¨osungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator_ whether or not to perform the contract unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law. Any judicial enforcement action brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once insolvency proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by a court, with respect to assets other than real estate also between the time when an insolvency petition is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings commence). If, during the final month preceding the date of filing for 335 ----- insolvency proceedings, a creditor acquires through execution (i.e., Zwangsvollstreckung) a security interest in the debtor’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon opening of the insolvency proceedings. Accordingly, unsecured creditors (e.g., creditors only having a guarantee but no asset security) may file their claims in the insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent sufficient assets are available). Assets which serve as collateral for secured creditors are realised either by the insolvency administrator or the relevant secured creditor and the enforcement proceeds are-paid to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. Remaining amounts (‘‘excess _proceeds’’) are distributed amongst the unsecured creditors. If a German Domiciled Security Grantor_ grants security over its assets to other creditors than holders of the Notes, such security will result in a preferred satisfaction of such other creditors’ secured claims (however, the preferential treatment would be limited to the proceeds obtained through the disposal of the relevant collateral). The excess proceeds resulting from the disposal of collateral provided to such other creditors may not be sufficient to satisfy the claims of the holders of the Notes against the German Domiciled Security Grantor under the Guarantees. In addition, it may take several years before proceeds from the liquidation of the insolvency estate, if any, are distributed to unsecured creditors. A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires the consent of the debtor as well as the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a debt to equity swap through an insolvency plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt to equity conversion if it does not consent to such debt to equity swap. From the perspective of the holders of the Notes, among others, some important consequences of the opening of formal insolvency proceedings against the German Domiciled Security Grantor would be the following: (a) the right to administer and dispose of the assets of the German Domiciled Security Grantor or any of its relevant subsidiaries would generally pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate, unless the court orders debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung); (b) if the court does not order debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) with respect to the German Domiciled Security Grantor, disposals effected by the management of the German Domiciled Security Grantor, after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, are null and void by operation of law; (c) if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a creditor in the insolvency proceedings has acquired through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of the German Domiciled Security Grantor’ property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings; (d) claims against the German Domiciled Security Grantor may only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and (e) any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderungsrecht) (i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute part of the insolvency estate) does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator. All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the insolvent debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest, entitlement to enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context, it should be noted that the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any moveable assets in his/the debtor’s possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte), security transfer of title (Sicherungs¨ubereignung) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). In case the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add-up to 9 per cent. of the gross enforcement 336 ----- proceeds plus VAT (if any) are disbursed to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. With the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor, the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegl¨aubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims—Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is value remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security interests and the preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full. Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency law point of view, has to be dealt with separately on an entity-by-entity basis (i.e., there is no group insolvency concept under German insolvency law). This situation has not fundamentally changed with the effectiveness of the act to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der _Bew¨altigung von Konzerninsolvenzen—‘‘Act on Group Insolvencies’’) on 21 April 2017, which provides for_ measures of coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. However, the Act on Group Insolvencies does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims amongst the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates certain amendments of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) with the aim to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each group entity insolvency proceedings; (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for ‘‘coordination proceedings’’ (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a ‘‘coordination _insolvency_ _administrator’’ (Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a ‘‘coordination plan’’ (Koordinationsplan). The EU Insolvency Regulation provides in its Articles 61 et seq. for a similar concept which shall be applicable on an opt-in basis to the extent that proceedings relating to different members of the same group of companies have been opened in more than one member state of the European Union.

187,Offerings 2020.md,568,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY,568.4,Germany,568.4.4,Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer,"Under the German Insolvency Code, the insolvency administrator (or in the event debtor-in-possession status has been granted, the trustee (Sachwalter)) may challenge (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the commencement of formal insolvency proceedings during applicable avoidance / hardening periods. Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully voided by the insolvency administrator or trustee, any amounts or other benefits derived from such challenged transaction, performance or act must be returned to the insolvency estate. The administrator’s right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings. On 29 March 2017, the German legislator passed an act for the improvement of legal certainty concerning clawback pursuant to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) and the German Law on Avoidance (Gesetz zur Verbesserung _der Rechtssicherheit bei Anfechtungen nach der Insolvenzordnung und nach dem Anfechtungsgesetz), which_ entered into force on 5 April 2017 (subject to certain transitional provisions). The amendments to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) and the German Law on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz) concern, among others, the provisions for avoidance claims in connection with wilful intent (Vorsatzanfechtung), for cash transactions (Bargesch¨afte) and the interest rates on avoidance claims (Verzinsung des Anfechtungsanspruchs). In the event of insolvency proceedings based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the granting of security and guarantees for or providing credit support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator under the rules of avoidance as set out in the German Insolvency Code. The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a ‘‘cash transaction’’ and may as such be privileged—under certain circumstances—under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) (Bargesch¨aftsprivileg—Cash-consideration Privilege) by not 337 ----- being subject to avoidance rights. In case the validity or enforceability of the Guarantees and/or security interests granted by a German Domiciled Security Grantor is voided successfully, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes would be under an obligation to repay the amounts received under the Guarantees and/or Collateral to the insolvency estate or to waive or release such Guarantees and/or Collateral. If any of the Guarantees and/or Collateral were avoided or held unenforceable for any reason, the Trustee and the holder of the Notes would cease to have any claim or benefit in respect thereof and would have to rely solely on the claims under the Notes and the remaining Guarantees and/or Collateral, if any. In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgesch¨aft) (which term includes the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the debtor may be avoided according to the German Insolvency Code in the following cases: - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunf¨ahig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of circumstances that clearly suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances that clearly suggest such illiquidity or filing); - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled, or which was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time or (iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that clearly suggest such detrimental effect); - a legal transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew either of the debtor’s illiquidity or of such filing at the time of the transaction; - any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings; - any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the intention of prejudicing its insolvency creditors (vors¨atzliche Gl¨aubigerbenachteiligung) and the beneficiary of the act knew of such intention at the time of such act; such knowledge being presumed if the creditor knew of the impeding illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit) of the debtor and that the act was prejudicial to insolvency creditors. In case the act in question granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the hardening period is reduced to four years. If the creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction, it must have known of the illiquidity (and not an impeding illiquidity) of the debtor for its knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice its insolvency creditors to be presumed. A creditor that agreed on a payment plan with the debtor or agreed to deferred payments is presumed to not have had knowledge of the illiquidity of the debtor. If the act fulfils the requirements of the Cash-consideration Privilege, the act will only be voidable if the other party knew that the debtor was acting dishonestly; - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party that directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be voided unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term ‘‘affiliated party’’ includes, subject to 338 ----- certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning more than 25 per cent. of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons who are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons; - any act that provides security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a claim of a shareholder for repayment of a shareholder loan or a similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, the act took place during the last ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition; or - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third-party if (i) the satisfaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor or surety (Garant oder B¨urge). In this context, ‘‘knowledge’’ is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor (e.g., a German Domiciled Security Grantor) was unable to pay its debts generally as they fall due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. The debtor is deemed to have acted with the intention to prejudice its insolvency creditors not only if prejudicing its creditors was the final objective of its acts but also if the insolvent party was aware that its acts might prejudice its creditors and accepted this to achieve a different objective. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if it knew of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With respect to an ‘‘affiliated party,’’ there is a general statutory presumption that such party had ‘‘knowledge.’’ The COVInsAG, however, provides for a privileged treatment of any kind of newly granted third-party financing (i.e., not only traditional cash loans but also commercial credits and other forms of financing) and shareholder loans under German insolvency law avoidance provisions. Thus, the repayment (including reasonable interest payments) of third-party financing and shareholder loans by 30 September 2023 shall not be considered disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant financing is granted between 1 March 2020 and 30 September 2020 and the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the filing duties. This privilege also includes the provision of collateral in favour of third-party financing providers, but does not apply in case of the provision of collateral in favour of a shareholder loan or receivables from economically similar acts. Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator avoiding transactions according to the German Insolvency Code described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also avoid any security right or payment performed under the relevant security right according to the German Law of Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal insolvency proceedings. The prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts. The German restructuring laws will likely be subject to further amendments in near future. On 20 June 2019, the Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the ‘‘Restructuring _Directive’’) has been adopted. The Restructuring Directive was published in the Official Journal of the_ European Union on 26 June 2019, and the member states have two years to implement the substantive parts of the Restructuring Directive into their national legislation, although a one year extension can be granted. The Restructuring Directive aims to put in place key principles for all member states on effective preventive restructuring and second chance frameworks, and measures to make all types of insolvency procedures more efficient by reducing their length and associated costs and improving their quality. The key feature of the Restructuring Directive is the introduction of a preventive restructuring framework. The Restructuring Directive sets out minimum EU standards to be applied by the member states (i.e., minimum harmonization). Whereas certain features of the Restructuring Directive need to be implemented into national legislation, the Restructuring Directive leaves a large degree of discretion 339 ----- regarding the implementation of certain other features. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which, _inter alia, claims of affected creditors may be modified in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75 per cent. of the amount of claims in each class and, where applicable, a majority by numbers, i.e. against the voting of a single creditor, in a pre insolvency restructuring procedure, i.e. outside formal insolvency proceedings. The Restructuring Directive also provides for cross class cram down, i.e. even if the creditors of one class voting on the restructuring plan did not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority, the restructuring plan might still be adopted and take effect for the dissenting creditors. Further, the Restructuring Directive provides for a stay on enforcement, which needs to be implemented into national legislation. The implementation of the Restructuring Directive into national legislation might also include priority ranking for new and interim financing.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

If a guarantee or a security interest is being provided in the context of an acquisition, group reorganization or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be triggered. An Italian company (each an ‘‘Italian Guarantor’’) granting a guarantee must receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee. Such principle on corporate benefit applies equally to down-stream, cross-stream and up-stream guarantees granted by Italian companies. While the existence of a corporate benefit in relation to a downstream guarantee is usually self-evident (i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant guarantor), the existence of a corporate benefit in relation to a cross-stream or an up-stream guarantee (i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing financial obligations of direct or indirect parent companies or sister companies of the relevant guarantor) may be challenged unless it can be proved that the guarantor may derive some benefits or advantages from the granting of the guarantee, therefore it should be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis (such as in the case of Subsidiary Guarantors which are providing the Guarantees in connection with the Notes offered hereby). The concept of ‘‘corporate benefit’’ is not expressly defined under Italian law and it is assessed and determined on a case-by-case basis, further its existence is purely a business decision of the directors and the statutory auditors. As a general rule, corporate benefit is assessed at the level of the relevant company on a standalone basis, although in certain circumstances, and subject to specific rules, the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. In particular, in case of up-stream and cross-stream guarantees for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other members of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what 340 ----- extent such transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest. Generally, the risk assumed by an Italian Guarantor must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to such Italian Guarantor. In principle, absence of a real and adequate benefit could make the Guarantees ultra vires and potentially affected by conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be subject matter of challenges and annulment. As a result, civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian Guarantor if it is assessed that they did not act in the best interest of such Italian Guarantor and that the acts they carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the relevant Italian Guarantor or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over an Italian Guarantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. However, no liability can be attributed where no prejudice or actual damage is suffered by the Italian Guarantor because of the determination of the controlling shareholder as provided under Article 2497 of the Italian Civil Code having regard to the overall result of the controlling activity. Moreover, the Guarantees could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third-party involved in the transaction and such third-party acted intentionally against the interest of such Italian Guarantor. The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, down-stream or cross-stream guarantees granted by an Italian Guarantor. As to corporate authorisations prospective, the granting of a guarantee by an Italian company in favour of third-parties or other corporations belonging to the same group of companies of the Italian Guarantor must be permitted by the by-laws (statuto) of the Italian company providing such guarantee. In addition, the granting of a guarantee by an Italian company cannot include any liability which would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful for a company to give financial assistance (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition or subscription by a third-party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian company. Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness originally incurred for the purchase or subscription of its own shares or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company would also be a violation. Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions is null and void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the best interests of the company. In the light of the above, in no event shall the obligations and liabilities of an Italian Guarantor under a guarantee include the obligation to guarantee financial indebtedness which was incurred, in full or in part, to purchase the shares of such Italian Guarantor (or of any of its direct or indirect holding company) and which would therefore constitute the provision of financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 and/or Article 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code and/or any other law or regulation having the same effect, as interpreted by Italian courts. If the proceeds of the Notes were to be used for the acquisition of shares (or quotas, as applicable) in the Subsidiary Guarantors (the entities which, amongst others, provided the Guarantees) incorporated in Italy (or of any of its direct or indirect holding company), this may be construed as a violation of Article 2474 and/or Article 2358 of the Italian Civil Code whereas, in the latter case, an authorisation proceeding in the shareholders’ meeting is not implemented. To this extent the total value of the guarantee cannot exceed the profits and the distributable reserves as resulting from the approved financial statements. Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity within the meaning of Article 106 of the Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993 (the ‘‘Italian _Banking Act’’), whose exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and authorised financial intermediaries._ Non-compliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, inter alia, entail the Guarantees being considered null and void. In this respect, the Ministerial Decree No. 53 of 2 April 2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of guarantees or security by a company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same group does not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby ‘‘group’’ includes controlling and controlled companies within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies, which are under the control of the same entity. As a result of the above described rules, subject to the Italian Guarantor and the guaranteed 341 ----- entity being part of the same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial activity. In addition, under Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a personal guarantee is issued to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). It has been held, that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant guarantor’s assets. It is uncertain, however, whether courts are entitled to debate and to rule over such determination. Italian Law No. 108 of 7 March 1996, as amended, implemented or supplemented from time to time (the ‘‘Italian Usury Law’’), prevents lenders from applying interests higher than certain rates, as set forth in accordance with the Italian Usury Law (the ‘‘Usury Rates’’). In addition, even where the Usury Rates are not exceeded, the interest rate applicable may be held usurious if: (i) it is considered to be disproportionate to the amount lent (taking into account the specific circumstances of the transaction and the average rate applicable to similar transactions in the market) and (ii) the debtor is deemed to have been in financial and economic difficulties at the time the indebtedness was incurred. In order to comply with (i) the Italian Usury Law and Article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii) the mandatory provisions of Italian law in relation to capitalization of interests (including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code), the obligations of any Italian Guarantor under a guarantee shall not include and shall not extend to (x) Usury Rates and (y) any interest on overdue amounts compounded in violation of the provisions set forth by Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, respectively. In any event, pursuant to Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, a guarantee granted by an Italian Guarantor must be capped to a maximum guaranteed amount.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

In Italy, courts play a central role in the insolvency process. Moreover, in-court procedures may be materially more complex and the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be more time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include special provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorised to carry out certain reserved activities (except for the description of certain insolvency proceeding to which they may be subject) nor does it provide a comprehensive description of insolvency laws applicable to public companies. Recently a comprehensive reform of the Italian insolvency laws and of the regulation of overindebtedness crises has been introduced (‘‘2019 Reform’’). In particular, on 19 October 2017, the Italian Senate approved Law No. 155, pursuant to which it has authorized the government to carry out a substantial reform of Italian insolvency laws, on the basis of several guidelines. The purpose of the 2019 Reform was mostly (i) to ensure the rationality of the provisions on insolvency, affected over the years by various amendments (especially in the civil sector) which caused a great degree of legal uncertainty, (ii) to allow early awareness of the financial distress of a business and (iii) to safeguard the business’ entrepreneurial potential during a crisis. On 12 January 2019, the government enacted a new bankruptcy code implementing the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 dated 19 October 2017, which enacts a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, inter alia, insolvency matters (the ‘‘Insolvency Code’’). The main amendments included: (i) the elimination of the term ‘‘bankruptcy’’ (fallimento) due to its negative connotation and its replacement with a reference to a judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale), (ii) the introduction of a definition of state of crisis (stato di crisi), (iii) the adoption of the same procedural framework in order to ascertain such state of crisis and to access the different judicial insolvency proceedings provided for by the Insolvency Code, (iv) the adoption of the definition of debtor’s ‘‘centre of main interests’’ as provided for in the new set of rules concerning group restructurings, (v) the introduction of restrictions relating to the use of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) in order to favour going-concern restructurings, (vi) a new preventive alert and mediation phase to avoid insolvency, (vii) providing for the jurisdiction of specialized courts over proceedings involving large debtors and (viii) amendments to certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code aimed at ensuring the general effectiveness of the 2019 Reform. Therefore, the practical consequences of its implementation and its potential impact on the existing 342 ----- insolvency proceedings cannot to date be foreseen and significant amendments are expected in the near future that may impact the provisions set forth therein. All types of debtors, with the exception of the State and public entities, will be subject to the procedures set out therein. Indeed, the Insolvency Code shall apply both to natural persons (consumers, professionals and entrepreneurs) and to legal persons (including non-profit companies, organizations and groups of companies). On 14 February 2019, the Insolvency Code has been published in the official journal. Except for minor changes in some provisions of the Italian Civil Code (and certain express repeals in the criminal sector) which already entered into force on 16 March 2019, according to Article 389 of the Legislative Decree No. 14 of 12 January 2019, the Insolvency Code will enter into force 18 months following its publication in Italy’s official journal (i.e., 15 August 2020). Nevertheless, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, such entry into force of the Insolvency Code has been currently postponed to 1 September 2021, according to Article 5 of the Law Decree No. 23 of 8 April 2020, subject to conversion in law by the Italian Parliament. Until that date, insolvency proceedings will continue to be governed by Italian Royal Decree No. 267 of 16 March 1942 (the ‘‘Italian Bankruptcy Law’’), as in force before. Leaving aside the 2019 Reform, the Italian Bankruptcy Law saw many reforms in the near past. In particular, material innovations regarding composition with creditors and debt restructuring agreements under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and out of court restructuring plans pursuant to Article 67, paragraph 3(d), of the Italian Bankruptcy Law were introduced by Law Decree No. 83 of 22 June 2012, as converted by Law No. 134 of 3 August 2012 (the ‘‘Development Decree’’). The purpose of this reform was to boost the restructuring and reorganization of distressed enterprises in order to cope better with the current financial crisis. To achieve this purpose, the Development Decree has focused mainly on three factors: flexibility of the process, reliability of the restructuring plan and tax appeal. Amendments to the Italian Bankruptcy Law were also introduced with regard to the composition with creditors by Decree No. 69 of 21 June 2013, which sets out urgent measures aimed at boosting the country’s economy (the ‘‘Decreto del Fare’’) and includes some important changes to the rules regarding the application introduced by the Development Decree. A significant reform was approved by the Italian government on 23 June 2015, through a Law Decree containing urgent reforms applicable, inter alia, to the Italian Bankruptcy Law (the ‘‘Decree No. 83’’). The Decree No. 83 (‘‘Urgent reforms concerning Bankruptcy Law, Civil Law, Civil Procedure Law and Court _administration’’) entered into force in June 2015 and was incorporated into Italian law by Italian Law_ No. 132 of 6 August 2015 (‘‘Law 132’’). Law 132/2015 entered into force on 21 August 2015. The primary aim of the Italian Bankruptcy Law used to be to liquidate the debtor’s assets (with the continuation of the assets as a going-concern (where applicable) only if this would satisfy a creditor’s claim). This competing aim often has been balanced by the sale of businesses as going-concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. However, the Italian Bankruptcy Law has been subsequently amended with a view to promoting rescue procedures rather than liquidation, focusing on the continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses and enhancing pre-bankruptcy restructuring options. Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent, and not a temporary, status of insolvency, in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent. In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out of court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company, but which are susceptible to being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions.

An independent expert appointed by the debtor and enrolled in the Register of Auditors and Accounting Experts (Registro dei _Revisori Contabili) has to verify (i) the financial and commercial feasibility of the restructuring plan and the_ accuracy of the business and accounting data provided by the company and included in the plan, without the need to obtain court approval to appoint the expert. The expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code. The expert may be liable for misrepresentation or false certification. The terms and conditions of the restructuring plans are freely negotiable, provided that they are finalised at restructuring the debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its capital structure. Unlike in composition with creditors proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out of court debt restructuring plans pursuant to Article 67, paragraph 3(d), of the Italian Bankruptcy Law do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/or acts carried out for the implementation of the reorganisation plan, subject to certain conditions: (a) are not subject to clawback action; and (b) are exempted from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the companies’ register are needed (although, publication in the companies’ register is possible upon a debtors request and would allow for certain tax benefits) and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of a court-supervised composition with creditors or a debt restructuring agreement. In order to grant protection against clawback actions and potential civil and criminal responsibilities, out of court debt restructuring plans pursuant to Article 67, paragraph 3(d), of the Italian Bankruptcy Law must be supported by adequate documentation representing the financial and commercial situation of the company. Moreover, they must be suitable for the purpose of assuring the restructuring of the indebtedness of the debtor and the rebalancing of its financial position and, in case of its failure and subsequent challenge before an Italian court, it must not be deemed as unreasonable.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding A0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding A0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of A0.5 million. Only the debtor company can initially file a petition for a concordato _preventivo with the court based in the location of the company’s main office. The debtor shall submit the_ petition together with, _inter alia, a restructuring plan containing an analytical description of manner and timing of the fulfilment of the proposal and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company. Plans based on business continuity further require the expert to certify that business continuity would be beneficial for the creditors. The petition for _concordato preventivo is then published by the debtor in the companies’ register and communicated to the public prosecutor. The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at least 20 per cent. of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of Composition with Creditors with continuity of the going-concern (concordato con continuit`a aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, including through extraordinary transactions such as the granting to creditors and their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (also convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor 344 ----- company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into different classes, provided that each class is composed of creditors having homogeneous legal positions and economic interests; and (iv) different treatments for creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. In order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, Law No. 132 sets forth that a Composition with Creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a pre-Composition with Creditors proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage of at least 20 per cent. of their claims. This provision does not apply to Composition with Creditors proposals based on the continuation of the going-concern (concordato con continuit`a aziendale). Under the Composition with Creditors there is no dispossession of the debtor who accordingly retains management powers under the supervision of a court appointed official (commissario giudiziale) and the delegated judge. From the date of the publication of the petition to the date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, the debtor is entitled to operate in the ordinary course of its business, although extraordinary transactions require the prior written approval of the court. During this time, all enforcement actions, precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed (‘‘Automatic Stay’’). The accrual of interests is suspended for the same timeframe, except for claims secured by pledges, liens or mortgages. Pre-existing creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in the companies’ register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. Any act, payment or security executed or created after the filing of the concordato preventivo application and in accordance with its rules and procedures is exempt from clawback action. The debtor is also exempt from certain bankruptcy crimes provided under Articles 216, paragraph 3 (preferential bankruptcy), and 217 (simple bankruptcy) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, in relation to acts and payments made in execution of the Composition with Creditors and/or in relation to finance provided under Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law upon judicial authorization. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company have super-priority (prededucibilit`a) in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy (see ‘‘Statutory priorities’’ below). In addition, pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, also the claims arising from financing, in any form, granted in execution of the Composition with Creditors (finanza in esecuzione) or with the purpose of filing the application for concordato preventivo (so-called ‘‘finanza ponte’’) have legal super-priority (prededucibilit`a) in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy, accordingly to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Claims arising from _finanza ponte have super-priority in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy on the condition that the financing is provided by the plan and it is stated in the decree admitting the Composition with Creditors. The filing of the application for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary and simplified petition for a concordato preventivo (so-called concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Law Decree No. 69 of 21 June 2013, as converted into Italian Law No. 98 of 9 August 2013). The debtor company may file such petition along with (i) its financial statements of the last three financial years and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation within a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension. Nevertheless, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Article 9 of the Law Decree No. 23 of 8 April 2020, subject to conversion into law by the Italian Parliament, provides that the debtor company which has been granted such extension by the Court, can, before the deadline, request for a further extension up to 90 days, even if it has been filed an appeal for a declaration of bankruptcy. The petition provides for the elements that make it necessary to grant the extension with specific reference to the events that have occurred as a result of of the epidemiological emergency COVID-19. The Court, acquired the opinion of the judicial commissioner (if appointed), grants the extension when it considers that the application is based on reasonable grounds. The petition may be filed by the debtor who has been granted the hearing referred to in the Article 182-bis, paragraph 7, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The Court in closed session, omitted the obligations provided for in Article 182-bis, paragraph 7, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, grants the extension when considers that the application is based on reasonable grounds and that the conditions for reaching a debt restructuring agreement with the majorities referred to in the Article 182-bis, paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are satisfied. In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of a debt 345 ----- restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If accepts such preliminary application, it may (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of non-existent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), shall report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a concordato preventivo and (ii) sets forth reporting and information duties of the company during the above-mentioned period. The debtor company may not file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous two years without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed. The decree setting the term for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (relating also to the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfil, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company shall file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is published, the following day, in the companies register. Noncompliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the restructuring plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and, if appointed, the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents. Following the filing of the petition for _concordato in bianco and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the distressed company may (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity and (ii) seek the court’s authorisation to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company have super-priority (prededucibilit`a) in case of subsequent bankruptcy. In addition, pursuant to Article 182-quinquies, paragraph 3, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, new supersenior indebtedness authorised by the court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the DRA or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 2(e), of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business (finanza d’urgenza), are treated as super-senior (prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The company shall properly document: (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that required funds cannot be obtained otherwise and (iii) that the lack of such funds would damage the company (Article 182-quinquies, paragraph 2, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). The super-seniority of the claims, which arises out of loans granted with a view to allowing the filing of the petition for concordato in bianco (finanza ponte), is granted, pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, conditional upon the proposal, the plan and all other required documents being filed within the term set by the court and the company being admitted to the concordato preventivo within the same proceeding opened with the filing of the preliminary petition. Superpriority nature shall be expressly provided for by the plan (Article 182-quater, paragraph 2, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). Pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a _concordato preventivo is based on business continuity (concordato con continuit`a aziendale) if the proposal provides for: (i) the continuation of the business by the debtor; (ii) the sale of the business as a going-concern; (iii) or the contribution-in-kind of the business as a going-concern to one or more companies (even if newly incorporated). In these cases, the petition for the _concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going-concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert shall also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented. The plan may provide a moratorium of up to one year from the granting of approval for the payment of creditors secured by pledges, mortgages and liens in relation to pre-existing debts, unless the plan provides for the liquidation of assets secured by pre-emption rights. Existing contracts, even if entered with governmental bodies, are not be terminated by admission to procedure. Furthermore, the going-concern based arrangements with creditors can provide for, _inter alia, the winding-up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. The composition agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. 346 ----- Under Article 182-quinquies, paragraph 5, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a debtor who files for a _concordato preventivo based on business continuity may request the court to be authorized to pay pre-filing_ claims relating to the purchase of goods or services if an independent expert certifies that they are essential for business continuity and to ensure the best satisfaction of creditors. If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls a creditors’ meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its board of directors, but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge, who shall authorise all transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business. Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree No. 83, as amended by Law 132, provides that, if the Composition with Creditors plan, pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 2(e), of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer for the sale of the debtor’s assets or the sale of a going-concern of the debtor to an identified third-party, the court shall open a competitive bidding process by decree establishing the terms of participation for the bidders. A bidder’s offer is irrevocable. If there is more than one improving offer, the Judge shall open a new competitive bidding process between bidders. The debtor must reform _concordato preventivo proposal and plan in accordance with results of competitive bidding process. If the plan filed by the debtor does not ensure the repayment of unsecured claims in an amount at least equal to 40 per cent. of their nominal value (if based on liquidation) or 30 per cent. (if based on business continuity pursuant to Article 186 bis), creditors holding claims representing at least 10 per cent. of the aggregate debt (even if the claims have been assigned to the creditors after the filing of the concordato preventivo petition) may submit (within 30 days prior to the scheduled hearing) a competing Composition with Creditors proposal (proposta concorrente), alternative to the one provided by the debtor. These creditors are entitled to vote on the proposta concorrente only if they are located in an independent class. The proposta concorrente setting out several classes of creditors shall be submitted to the bankruptcy court in order to verify the accuracy of the criteria used in creating different classes. The _concordato preventivo proposal is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favourable vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables entitled to vote and, also in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of the classes. The Composition with Creditors is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favour of the proposal. Law 132 abrogated the implied consent rule under which those creditors who, being entitled to vote, did not do so and those who did not express their dissent within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting are deemed as consenting to the composition with creditors. Under the current regime, creditors who did not exercise their voting rights in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via email) within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting and, after such term, creditors who have did not exercise their voting right will be deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The court may also approve the _concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if (i) the majority of the classes has approved the concordato preventivo and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through the concordato preventivo compared to other solutions If an objection to the implementation of the _concordato preventivo is filed by at least 20 per cent. or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a_ creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the court nevertheless may sanction the concordato _preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a_ result of the concordato preventivo than would be otherwise be the case. After the approval of the concordato preventivo proposal, dissenting creditors (or creditors belonging to a dissenting class) representing 20 per cent. or more of the liabilities may file an opposition (opposizione), challenging the economic convenience of the plan. In such case, the court has the authority to ‘‘cram-down’’ dissenting creditors, compelling their acceptance of the plan, if it deems that the proposed treatment of their claims is equivalent to what they would recover in a Bankruptcy scenario. After the creditors’ approval, the bankruptcy court approves the Composition with Creditors and appoints one or more liquidators in order to execute the approved plan, if it has to be realised by way of a transfer of assets. 347 ----- The court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by taking all corporate actions required. If the creditors participating at the meeting do not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the public prosecutor or a creditor and after having ascertained the condition for declaration of bankruptcy, declare the company bankrupt. The terms and the performance of outstanding contracts are not automatically affected by _concordato _preventivo. However, pursuant to Article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the_ competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non _compiutamente eseguiti), except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above_ provision (e.g., employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), preliminary sale agreements (contratti preliminari di vendita) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili)). The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the application for the concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable just once. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfilment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid prior to and outside of the admission to the pre-bankruptcy composition. In the event of a breach of the Composition with Creditors plan or fraud, bankruptcy may follow, at the behest of the bankruptcy court. If the Composition with Creditors is implemented, the debts are discharged and the debtor may return to its usual operations (if the assets of the company are still in his possession). Claims (including claims for repayment of loans) arising in the course of the implementation of the plan (whether before or after approval, conditional upon the bankruptcy court confirming such priority in the decree of admission), are granted the highest priority and must be paid in full. _Concordato preventivo is compulsory for all creditors prior to the publication of the application in the_ companies’ register. However, creditors retain without prejudice their rights against co-debtors, guarantors of the debtor and other joint and severally liable debtors. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Article 9 of the Law Decree No. 23 of 8 April 2020, subject to conversion in law by the Italian Parliament, the deadlines for the fulfilment of _concordati _preventivi and the ratified debt restructuring agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione omologati) expiring in_ the period between 23 February 2020 and 31 December 2021 shall be extended by six months. In the procedures for the validation (omologazione) of _concordato preventivo and of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti), pending on 23 February 2020 the debtor may submit, until the hearing, a petition for the grant of an extension up to 90 days for the deposit of a new plan and a new proposal for a concordato in accordance with Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a new debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The period starts from the date of the decree by which the court assigns the term, and it shall not be extended. The request is inadmissible if submitted in the context of a concordato preventivo in the course of which it has already been held the meeting of creditors but the majorities were not reached according to Article 177 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

An independent expert, directly appointed by the debtor, must assess the truthfulness of the debtor’s business and accounting data provided by the company and declare that the agreement is feasible and, in particular, that it ensures that the non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within a 120 day term from: (i) the date of ratification of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the sanctioning (‘‘omologazione’’) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (ii) the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of receivables which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Only a debtor who is insolvent or in a state of crisis (i.e., facing financial distress which does not yet amount to insolvency) can 348 ----- initiate this process and request the court’s sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors. The DRA must be published in the Italian companies’ register to become effective in respect of thirdparties. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from such publication. The court will, after having settled the oppositions (if any), validate the agreement by issuing a decree, which may be appealed within 15 days of its publication. The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the DRA. The plan can therefore provide, inter alia, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third-party, or the sale of the business to a third-party and may contain, refinancing agreements, moratoria, write-offs and/or postponements of claims. The DRA may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 modified the basis for calculation of the 60 per cent. of the outstanding debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’ sanctioning of debt restructuring agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti), easing the requirements with respect to financial creditors. _The Key Features of a DRA_ A by law 60-day moratorium (automatic stay) applies starting from the date of publication of the DRA. During the standstill period creditors cannot start or continue any interim proceedings or enforcement actions over the assets of the debtor. Creditors cannot obtain any security interest (unless it is agreed in the DRA) in relation to the pre-existing debts. The moratorium can be requested, pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, by the debtor to the court pending negotiations with creditors (prior to the DRA’s above-mentioned publication of the agreement) subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions. Such moratorium request must be published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of publication. No dispossession of debtor occurs in respect of a DRA. It is a courtsupervised procedure, which can take from a few months up to more than a year (the duration of the proceedings is generally influenced by challenges). Creditors entering into the DRA are not required to receive the same treatment (i.e., they are free to reject the proposal and to protect their interests otherwise) and no cram-down is applicable to third-party not adhering creditors, who shall be fully repaid within 120 days from validation of the DRA (if the claims are already due and payable at such date) or within 120 days from the respective maturity date. The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation, sets the date for the hearing within 30 days from the publication and orders the debtor to supply to the creditors the relevant documentation in relation to the moratorium. In such hearing, creditors and other interested parties may file an opposition to the DRA and the court assesses whether the conditions for granting the moratorium have been met and, if the court so determines, orders, that no interim relief or enforcement action may be started or continued, nor can security interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which the DRA has to be filed. The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time deadline of 60 days, an application for the _concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to the effect of the moratorium. Pursuant to the new Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, debtors whose financial indebtedness (i.e., debts with banks or other financial intermediaries) is at least 50 per cent. of their total indebtedness are entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreements obtaining the approval of financial creditors representing at least 75 per cent. of the aggregate financial claims of the relevant category and ask the court to declare such agreement binding on the dissenting financial creditors belonging to the same category (so-called ‘‘cram-down’’), if they (a) hold claims not exceeding 25 per cent. of the aggregate value of claims included in a consenting class, (b) have been duly informed of the negotiations relating to the DRA and have been granted the opportunity to participate in good faith, (c) have received complete and updated information on the economic and financial performance of the debtor and (d) are paid an amount at least equal to what would be recoverable according to feasible alternative scenarios. If the abovementioned conditions are met, then the remaining 25 per cent. of non-participating financial creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however, crammed down creditors can challenge the deal and refuse to be forced into it, on the basis of the lack of homogeneity of the classes of creditors. Similarly, a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and financial creditors representing 75 per cent. of that debtor’s aggregate financial indebtedness would also bind the non-participating financial creditors, 349 ----- provided that (i) they have been informed of the ongoing negotiations and have been allowed to participate in such negotiations in good faith; and (ii) an expert meeting the requirements provided under Article 67, paragraph 3(d), of the Italian Bankruptcy Law certifies that the non-consenting banks and financial intermediaries have legal status and economic interests similar to those of the banks and financial intermediaries which have agreed to the moratorium arrangement. The banks and financial intermediaries which have not agreed to the moratorium arrangement may challenge it (opposizione) within 30 days after having been notified of the moratorium arrangement. Such debt restructuring agreements and standstill agreements will not affect the rights of non-financial creditors (e.g. trade creditors) who cannot be crammed down and must be paid within 120 days if not participating to a scheme. In no case the debt restructuring agreement provided under Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or the moratorium arrangement may impose on the non-adhering creditors the performance of new obligations, the granting of new over-draft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities. Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant to the approved debt restructuring agreement (or a _concordato preventivo) (finanza in esecuzione) enjoy priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders, but only up to 80 per cent. of such financing). Financing granted ‘‘in view of’’ (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for the sanctioning (omologazione) a debt restructuring agreement or a Composition with Creditors (finanza ponte) may be granted such priority status provided that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority is expressly provided for by the court in the context of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement or the approval of the concordato preventivo. Same provisions apply to financings granted by shareholders up to 80 per cent. of their amount. Pursuant to the new Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the DRA, or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or of a petition pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (concordato in bianco, described below) may authorise the debtor to: (i) obtain new interim financings, having super-priority in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy, if an independent expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that such new financings are aimed at greater creditors’ satisfaction (finanziamenti interinali); and (ii) pay debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, already payable and due, provided that, the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of the company’s activities and to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors. In addition, according to the provisions of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132, the aforementioned authorization may be given also before the filing of the additional documentation required pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Furthermore, according to the Article 182-quinquies, paragraph 3, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 2(e), of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorise the debtor to incur in new indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business (finanza d’urgenza). The company, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing, (ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the company. Such indebtedness is treated as super-senior (credito prededucibile) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The provision of Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both DRA and to the compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below. All the acts, payments and guarantees over assets of the distressed company executed and/or performed according to a validated (omologato) DRA are exempt from clawback actions (revocatoria fallimentare) in the event of subsequent Bankruptcy. The exemptions from certain bankruptcy crimes provided under Articles 216, paragraph 3 (preferential _bankruptcy), and 217 (simple bankruptcy) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law apply, in relation to acts and_ 350 ----- payments made in accordance with the validated DRA and/or in relation to finance provided under Article 182-quinquies upon judicial authorization (in respect of _concordato preventivo, see below).

It results in the company’s dissolution. A company is declared bankrupt when insolvent. Insolvency, as defined under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. A request to declare a debtor company bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings and the judicial liquidation of the debtor company’s assets can be filed by (i) the debtor company itself, (ii) any of its creditors, provided that the debts which become overdue during the pre-bankruptcy evidential phase of the procedure amount to no less than A30,000, and (iii) in certain cases, by the public prosecutor. The bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding A0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding A0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of A0.5 million. Please note that in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Article 10 of the Law Decree No. 23 of 8 April 2020, subject to conversion into law by the Italian Parliament, the requests for bankruptcy declaration (fallimento) or for insolvency declaration of the entities subject to the compulsory administrative liquidation (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) and extraordinary administration pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 270/1999 (amministrazione straordinaria) filed between 9 March 2020 and 30 June 2020 are inadmissible. The provision does not apply to bankruptcy proceedings filed by the Public Prosecutor in which there has been a request for precautionary or conservative measures against the assets or the business, under Article 15, paragraph 8, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Furthermore, when the declaration of inadmissibility of the bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) or the insolvency proceedings with regards to a compulsory administrative liquidation (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) or an extraordinary administration (amministrazione straordinaria) pending between 9 March 2020 and 30 June 2020 is anyway followed by the bankruptcy declaration, the aforesaid period shall not be included (i) in the annual term set forth in Article 10 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law for bankruptcy declaration of companies cancelled from the companies’ register (Registro delle Imprese) and (ii) in the terms set forth in Article 69-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law referring the clawback actions. The provision is aimed to save the business continuity by avoiding the risk of insolvency declaration for the companies which may experience a time period of limited or interrupted operations and, at the same time, to preserve the creditors by ensuring them the whole term for the clawback actions (azioni revocatorie) in case bankruptcy is anyway declared at the end of that period (after 30 June 2020). Upon the commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding, amongst other things: (a) the debtor is dispossessed and the administration of the debtor company and the management of its assets pass from the debtor company to the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare), who manages and disposes of the assets under the direction of the delegated judge. The debtor may no longer validly act in court as claimant or defendant in relation to the assets (Article 43 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). The bankruptcy receiver is vested with such powers upon the authorization of the delegated judge. However, all pending proceedings in which the debtor is involved are automatically stayed from the date the adjudication is issued and need to be reinitiated by or against the bankruptcy receiver; (b) the payments of all debts and liabilities of the debtor and all the acts, transactions, payments made or received by the insolvent debtor are immediately suspended and formalities with third-parties that have been carried out after the declaration of bankruptcy are not effective as regards the creditors of the debtor (Article 45 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law); (c) subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims within a defined period. In particular, under certain circumstances, secured creditors may enforce against the 351 ----- secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of the secured assets, together with interest and expenses. Any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. The secured creditor may sell the secured asset only after it has obtained authorization from the designated judge (giudice delegato). After hearing the bankruptcy receiver and the creditors’ committee, the designated judge decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the timing in its decision; (d) certain payments made, securities given or transactions entered into by the debtor in a certain period before the debtor’s submission to a bankruptcy procedure (varying from six months to two years) can be set aside and clawed-back if certain conditions are met (Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law); (e) any act of the debtor done after the declaration of bankruptcy (including payments made and issuance of guarantees) is ineffective against the creditors; (f) the beginning of bankruptcy involves the cessation of all the activities of the company with a view to a sale of all assets. However, the bankruptcy court may order that business operations be continued whenever cessation could cause greater damage to the company, provided that the continuation does not adversely affect the creditors of the bankrupt debtor. If the bankruptcy court authorizes the continuation of the business (esercizio provvisorio dell’impresa del fallito), the management of the business is entrusted to the bankruptcy receiver (who may in turn avail himself of qualified thirdparties for this purpose); and (g) the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to either continue or terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed by both parties, certain contracts are governed by specific rules provided for by Italian Bankruptcy Law. The bankruptcy proceeding is carried out and supervised by a court appointed bankruptcy receiver, a deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee (comitato dei creditori). The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of any one of the creditors, but is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor for the satisfaction of the creditors as a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority rights. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real estate. In this respect, Law No. 132 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence the timing for the liquidation of a debtor is shortened. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for priority of payment to certain preferential creditors, including administrative costs associated with the bankruptcy proceeding and related to the receiver’s running of the company, Italian tax and national social security contributions and employee arrear of wages or salary. Such priority of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of Italian law (and, as a consequence, it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be recognised by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by applicable law). The following features of bankruptcy proceedings also merit mention: - Bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors (concordato fallimentare). A bankruptcy proceeding can terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The procedure is aimed at speeding up bankruptcy proceedings and is an alternative to a receiver conducting the liquidation proceedings. Over time it has proved to be more efficient in terms of costs and timing. The relevant proposal can be filed by one or more creditors or third-parties starting from the declaration of bankruptcy. By contrast, the debtor or its subsidiaries are admitted to file such a proposal only after one year following such declaration but within two years following the decree giving effectiveness to the liabilities account (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of _concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security or the _concordato fallimentare provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of_ their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. If the proposal is approved, the delegated judge orders the bankruptcy receiver to immediately notify the advocate of the approval in order to allow him to seek approval of the plan and furthermore to notify the debtor and any dissenting creditors. In the event that opposition is filed, the Bankruptcy Court, after having verified 352 ----- the regularity of the procedure and the outcome of the vote, approves the in bankruptcy composition proposal by means of a decree which is final and not subject to appeal. - Under Article 124 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law the proposal may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatment among the classes), the restructuring of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not provide any guidance with respect to the content of a concordato fallimentare; thus, it may encompass any kind of transaction to effect the liquidation of the assets of the debtor (e.g., debt-equity swap, sale of assets, business assignments, etc.). - The concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, also by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court ratification is also required. - Once approved, the _concordato fallimentare is binding against all non-accepting creditors (cram-down). - Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other European Union jurisdictions. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from the rules of statutory priority by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles (as a consequence it must be noted that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements may not be enforceable against an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). The rules of statutory priority apply irrespective of whether the proceeds are derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset. - Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of ‘‘claims with super-priority’’ (crediti prededucibili). In general, claims are considered to have super-priority when they are so qualified by a specific provision of law or when they arise as part of the bankruptcy (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceedings, such as costs related to the procedure). These claims are paid for the entire amount and before other claims (secured, preferred, unsecured and subordinated). Examples of these claims are bankruptcy receiver’s fees and costs; the costs of the sale of the assets; the rent for the debtor’s offices after adjudication; employees’ salaries and social security payments relating to the period after adjudication; attorney’s and other advisors’ fees. Such claims are satisfied in full (including costs and interests) with the proceeds of the liquidation of movable and immovable debtor’s assets, according to their rank (preferred, secured, unsecured), with the exclusion of the proceeds of the sale of assets subject to other creditors’ security interests (mortgages and pledges), which are directed to payment of secured creditors; (ii) for payment of claims that benefit from preferential treatment (crediti privilegiati in senso ampio _or crediti prelatizi), which include creditors who hold a security interest (creditori ipotecari o pignoratizi) and creditors who have a preference under law (creditori privilegiati in senso stretto),_ such as the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators and claims for employee wages. As a general principle, creditors holding a security interest are satisfied from the relevant assets to the exclusion of all other creditors, including secured creditors having a lower rank (e.g., first mortgage over second mortgage). However, the Italian Civil Code contains very detailed rules (Article 2745) regulating priority conflicts between secured and preferred creditors. A mortgagee and a pledgee are entitled to satisfy their claims from the proceeds of the sale of the encumbered assets. Any excess is available for distribution to other creditors (i.e., second mortgages, preferred creditors and unsecured creditors). Where the relevant asset is insufficient to satisfy its claim against the debtor, a creditor will rank as an unsecured creditor for the remainder; (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims (crediti chirografari). Unsecured creditors have no preference or security and will therefore be paid only if and to the extent any proceeds of the estate remain after all other claims have been satisfied. Unsecured creditors rank _pari passu among themselves in the estate, in proportion to the size of their claims; 353 ----- (iv) for the payment of subordinated creditors’ claims (creditori postergati e subordinati). Subordinated creditors have no preference or security and are subordinated by law or contractual provisions. They shall be paid only if and when all the creditors with a higher rank have been paid in full. - Avoidance powers in insolvency. A fundamental principle of the Italian Bankruptcy Law is the equal treatment of all creditors (‘‘par condicio creditorum’’), according to which, absent statutory priorities or security right, no creditor may be paid a higher percentage of his claim than other creditors. A consequence of this principle is not only that the payment of debts by the bankruptcy receiver are strictly regulated, but also that all transactions effected by the debtor over the previous year (or, in certain cases, over the previous six months) are scrutinised and potentially unwound as preferential. - Under Italian law, there are ‘‘clawback’’ or avoidance provisions that lead to, inter alia, the revocation of payments made or security interests granted by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key avoidance provisions include, but are not limited to, transactions made below market value, preferential transaction, transactions made with a view to defrauding creditors or to advantage one creditor. Clawback rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favourable to the receiver in bankruptcy compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions. - In a bankruptcy proceeding, depending on the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a clawback period of up to either one year or six months in certain circumstances (please note that in the context of extraordinary administration procedures—see below—in relation to certain transactions, the clawback period can be extended to five and three years, respectively) and a two year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions, which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below. (a) Acts ineffective by operation of law. (i) Under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exceptions, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective _vis-`a-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the bankruptcy estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of bankruptcy, without needing to wait until the ineffectiveness of the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge as a violation of law; and (ii) Under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of debts falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are deemed ineffective vis-`a-vis creditors, if made by the debtor within the two year period prior to the insolvency declaration. (b) Acts and transactions that could be declare ineffective at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/ court commissioner. (i) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed-back (revocati) vis-`a-vis the bankruptcy as provided for by Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and be declared ineffective unless the other party proves that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into: - the onerous transactions entered into in the year preceding the insolvency declaration, where the value of the debt or of the obligations undertaken by the debtor exceeds by 25 per cent. the value of the consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor; - payments of debts, due and payable, made by the debtor, which were not paid in cash or by other customary means of payment in the year preceding the insolvency declaration; - pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt in the year preceding the insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which have not yet fallen due; and - pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt in the six months preceding the insolvency declaration in order to secure which had fallen due. 354 ----- (ii) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed-back and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy receiver that the other party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the time of the act or transaction: - the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions entered into or made within six months before the insolvency declaration; and - the granting of a preferential right for debts simultaneously created (even those of thirdparties) and made within six months preceding the insolvency declaration. The following transactions are exempt from clawback actions: - a payment for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market practice; - a remittance on a bank account, provided that it does not reduce the bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank in a material and lasting manner; - a sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil Code, in force as at the date of this Offering Memorandum, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser, on the condition that, as of the date of the insolvency declaration, such activity is actually exercised or the investments for the start of such activity have been carried out; - transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees granted with respect to the bankrupt entity’s goods, provided that they concern the implementation of a piano di risanamento attestato (see ‘‘—Out of court debt restructuring plan pursuant to Article 67, _paragraph 3(d), of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (piano attestato di risanamento)’’ above);_ - a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee issued to implement a concordato preventivo (see ‘‘—Court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditor (concordato _preventivo)’’ above) or an_ _accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti (see ‘‘—Debt Restructuring Agreements with Creditors Pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (Accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti)’’ above) and transactions entered into, payments made and security_ interests granted after the filing of the application for a _concordato preventivo (see above); - remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants; and - payment of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedure. The limitation period for initiating clawback action is three years from the declaration of bankruptcy or, if earlier, five years from the act or transaction to be clawed-back. In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt entity be declared without effect _vis-`a-vis the acting creditors within the Italian Civil Code ordinary clawback period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria). Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions through which the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets to the detriment of such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of such detriment (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the debtor in order to cause detriment of such creditor’s rights) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third person, the third person was aware of such detriment (and, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third person participated in the fraudulent design). Burden of proof is entirely with the receiver. The Insolvency Code provides special regimes on preferences and avoidances of intra-group transactions. Under Article 290 the limitation period for initiating intra-group clawback actions (referring to acts and transactions entered into by companies belonging to the same group that jeopardize the creditors’ interest) is extended to five years from the filing for bankruptcy declaration. Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a ‘‘simplified’’ clawback action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with 355 ----- the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so-called fondo patrimoniale—’’family trust’’). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out by the creditor against the third-party purchaser. Please note that under Article 10 of Law Decree No. 23 of 8 April 2020, when the declaration of inadmissibility of the bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) or the insolvency proceedings with regards to a compulsory administrative liquidation (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) or an extraordinary administration (amministrazione straordinaria) pending between 9 March 2020 and 30 June 2020 is anyway followed by the bankruptcy declaration, the aforesaid period is not included in the terms set forth in Article 69-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law referring to the clawback actions.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

Prodi-bis Procedure, which is regulated by Legislative Decree No. 270 of 8 July 1999 (‘‘Prodi-bis Decree’’), replaces the previous special administration for large companies in a state of crisis (amministrazione straordinaria delle grandi Imprese in _crisi), introduced by Law No. 95 of 3 April 1979._ The relevant company must be insolvent, but demonstrating serious recovery prospects. To qualify for this procedure, the company must have employed at least 200 employees in the previous year. In addition, it must have debts equal to at least two-thirds of its assets as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income from sales and services during its last financial year. Any of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public prosecutor may make a petition to commence an extraordinary administration procedure. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to Extraordinary Administration. The procedure is divided into two main phases: a ‘‘judicial phase’’ and an ‘‘administrative phase.’’ (a) Judicial phase. In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints a judicial receiver (or up to three) (commissario giudiziale) to investigate whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or reorganisation. The judicial receiver files a report with the court within 30 days, and within ten days from such filing, the Italian Ministry of Economic Development may make an opinion on the admission of the company to the extraordinary administration procedure. The court then decides (within 30 days from the filing of the report) whether to admit the company to the procedure or to place it into bankruptcy. (b) Administrative phase. Assuming that the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative phase begins and an extraordinary commissioner(s) is appointed by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development. The extraordinary commissioner(s) prepare(s) a plan which can provide for either the sale of the business as a going-concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the ‘‘Disposal Plan’’) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the ‘‘Recovery _Plan’’). It may also include an arrangement with creditors (e.g., debt for equity swap, issue of shares in_ a new company to whom the assets of the company have been transferred). The plan must be approved by the Ministry of Economic Development within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary commissioner(s). In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry. The declaration of the state of insolvency produces certain immediate effects, such as the automatic stay of all legal actions by creditors against the debtor’s assets and the freezing of the accrual of interest. The effects of the admission to the Prodi-bis Procedure (Administrative Phase) are that the stay of actions continues and clawback actions become possible. Debts incurred in the continuation of the business generally will have super-priority over any other secured and unsecured claim (prededuzione) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. 356 ----- The unsecured creditors are exclusively represented by one or two members of the surveillance committee, which has consulting duties. Creditors can file their proofs of claim and have a right to the distribution of proceeds. Creditors can also oppose the declaration of the state of insolvency as well as the admission to the second phase. Under Article 53 of Prodi-bis Decree, the rules established by the Italian Bankruptcy Law regarding the creditors’ proofs of claim also apply to the Prodi-bis Procedure. The Prodi-bis Procedure can at any time be converted into bankruptcy upon request by the extraordinary commissioner, or even ex officio, if the procedure cannot be positively continued. At the end of the procedure, upon request of the extraordinary commissioner or even _ex officio, the bankruptcy court will declare the conversion of the procedure into bankruptcy when either the sale of the assets has been not performed within the term stipulated in the programme, or the business has not recovered its ability to regularly perform its obligations. Bankruptcy rules concerning criminal bankruptcy law and bankruptcy clawback law applies to the Prodi-bis Procedure. The clawback ‘‘avoidance period’’ is extended up to three to five years for Intra-Group transactions. The intragroup clawback action (revocatoria intragruppo) governed by Article 91 of Prodi-bis Decree refers to acts and transactions entered into by companies belonging to the same group if carried out during the period between the execution of the relevant transaction and the date of insolvency declaration (the ‘‘suspect period’’) preceding the insolvency declaration as follows: (i) _five years, with respect to: - transactions at an undervalue (transactions are deemed to be at undervalue when the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by 25 per cent. or more the value of the consideration received by the debtor); - transaction extinguishing of financial debts which have fallen due and are outstanding, involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind; settlement agreements, etc.); - pledges, anthicresis rights and voluntary mortgages granted or set up for pre-existing debts which had not yet fallen due; unless the creditor proves that it was not aware of the state of insolvency of the debtor; (ii) three years, with respect to securities (pledges, anthicresis rights and judicial or voluntary mortgages) created as collateral for debts which had fallen due, unless the creditor proves his lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the debtor in order to rebut any claw-back action; and (iii) three years, with respect to payment of due and outstanding debts, transactions for consideration and those granting a preferential right for debts (including third party’s debt) simultaneously created, provided that the extraordinary commissioner proves that the other party was aware of the state of insolvency of the debtor. The extraordinary commissioner is only entitled to initiate the intragroup claw-back action after the approval of the execution of the liquidation program (unless the _Prodi-bis Procedure is converted into _fallimento) and without the need of the authorization of the supervisory authority (i.e. Ministry of_ Economic Development).",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

The Marzano procedure is intended to be faster than the Prodi-bis Procedure and is aimed at saving and turning around large insolvent companies in order to preserve their value. For example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry of Economic Development is made together with the filing to the court for the declaration of the insolvency of the debtor. The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies that, on a consolidated basis, have at least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least A300 million of debt (including those from outstanding guarantees). The decision of whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry of Economic Development following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are 357 ----- met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency. This procedure restructures the company’s debts and sells those assets that are not strategic or do not form part of the company’s core business. The debtor must apply to the Minister of Economic Development for immediate admission to the procedure, while at the same time filing a petition with the bankruptcy court in order to confirm its insolvency status. It is the Minister, rather than the bankruptcy court, that has primary responsibility for supervising the procedure; the bankruptcy court is requested only to confirm the company’s insolvency status and verify the lawfulness of the proceeding with respect to the verification of claims. If the debtor is admitted to the procedure, other insolvent companies in the same corporate group may also participate, even if they do not satisfy the relevant requirements. The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry of Economic Development so agrees) to submit a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or Recovery Plan is approved by the Ministry of Economic Development, the court will declare the company bankrupt and open bankruptcy proceedings. The Recovery Plan can provide for the satisfaction of creditors’ claims through a composition, which must specify any conditions of its implementation and describe any offered guarantees. The extraordinary commissioner may bring clawback actions for the benefit of creditors during the implementation of a recovery plan. Bankruptcy rules concerning criminal bankruptcy law and bankruptcy clawback law applies to Marzano procedure. The clawback ‘‘avoidance period’’ is extended up to three to five years for intragroup transactions.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is a special sort of insolvency proceeding provided by the Italian Bankruptcy Law (Articles 194�213 and numerous special laws) in which the entity is liquidated not by the bankruptcy court, but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also on other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions). The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company by the relevant governmental authority (e.g. Bank of Italy, Ministry of the Economic Development). The debtor, the directors of an insolvent company, or one or more creditor(s) may apply to the bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy court must seek the advice of the government agency responsible for supervising the debtor’s business. The judge may initiate proceedings by declaring the debtor insolvent. All legal actions by creditors against the debtor are then stayed, with the exception of those aiming to ascertain the amount of any claim. The liquidator’s acts as a public officer and his actions are monitored by a steering committee (comitato di _sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the bankruptcy court under the other_ insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. Unlike other procedures, there is no delegated judge, as the procedure is mainly administrative in nature. The liquidator must review claims and consider whether a composition is feasible. If so, he will prepare with the debtor a plan of repayment, to be submitted to the creditors. The effect on creditors of the forced administrative winding-up is largely the same as under bankruptcy proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to extraordinary administration proceedings. If a composition does not appear feasible, arrangements are made for the disposal of the debtor’s assets and the distribution of proceeds among the creditors in the same order of priority as in bankruptcy. 358 -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

The relevant claims shall take precedence over the other creditors’ claims in case of bankruptcy (crediti prededucibili).

Proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code vary and provide a debtor with discretion in its pursuit of a liquidation or reorganization strategy. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides a detailed statutory framework that, among other things, contains terms or provisions relating to: (i) the administration of a bankruptcy case, including the provision of ‘‘adequate protection’’ to secured creditors, the automatic stay, terms for the use, sale or lease of property, standards for obtaining credit and the treatment of executory contracts and leases; (ii) creditors and claims, including filing proofs of claim, priority and allowance of claims, rights of creditors and subordination of claims; (iii) provisions relating to the creation of the bankruptcy estate, including the scope of property of the estate and turnover and avoidance actions; (iv) liquidation under chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code; (v) reorganization under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code; and (vi) ancillary and cross-border insolvency cases under chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a general matter, chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides for the orderly liquidation of the debtor’s assets by a trustee, and typically, a chapter 7 case results in the immediate shutdown of the debtor’s business. Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code is available to debtors who seek to continue to 359 ----- operate their business as a going-concern while they rehabilitate their businesses and restructure their obligations to creditors. Unlike in chapter 7, the debtor in a chapter 11 case remains in control of its assets absent court order divesting the debtor of control, and absent such a court order, the debtor continues to operate its business during the course of the bankruptcy case subject to the limitations imposed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and supervision of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, including that transactions outside of the ordinary course of business require prior court approval following notice and a hearing at which all parties in interest may be heard. In addition, ‘‘liquidating’’ chapter 11 cases may be utilized as an alternative to chapter 7 liquidations to provide for the sale of the debtor’s assets as a going-concern, especially where the conversion of a pending chapter 11 case to a case under chapter 7 and the resulting shutdown of the business might result in a loss of value for the debtor’s stakeholders. Because bankruptcy proceedings are inherently to be fact specific and vary case-by-case and because U.S. bankruptcy courts are courts of equity with broad discretionary powers, a detailed summary of all of the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code that could impact the Notes or the Guarantees is not contained herein. Furthermore, the common law applicable in bankruptcy proceedings may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and this summary is not intended to cover the common law that may apply in any particular jurisdiction. With respect to proceedings under any applicable state insolvency laws (e.g., assignments for the benefit of creditors, receiverships or other state liquidation mechanisms) and the application of state laws in bankruptcy proceedings (e.g., fraudulent transfer claims), the effects and outcomes of these proceedings are fact specific, vary from state to state and require an examination of both statutory and common law, the details of which also are not described herein.

Aspects of federal bankruptcy laws or general principles of equity that could result in the impairment of rights include, but are not limited to: - the automatic stay; - the avoidance of preferential transfers by a trustee, debtor-in-possession or other parties granted standing by the bankruptcy court; - the substantive consolidation of the assets and liabilities of multiple entities; - the limitations on the collectability of unmatured interest or attorney fees; - fraudulent transfer; and - the forced restructuring of the bonds issued by the bankrupt company, including reduction of principal amounts and interest rates and extension of maturity dates, or the conversion of debt to equity interests, other forms of consideration (such as interests in a trust) or potentially discharge of all obligations without significant recovery, over the holders’ objections. As an initial matter, the commencement of a bankruptcy case operates as a stay, applicable to all creditors, of virtually all private litigation against the debtor and efforts to collect prepetition claims, enforce existing liens or impose most new liens. The stay applies to the debtor and its assets globally. The purpose of the stay is to provide the chapter 11 debtor time to reorganize and the chapter 7 trustee protection under which to liquidate in an orderly fashion the debtor’s assets for the benefit of creditors. The automatic stay is also intended to shield a debtor from the pressures of creditor collection efforts. Among other things, the automatic stay prohibits (i) all collection efforts by creditors, (ii) the enforcement of prepetition judgments against the debtor or property of the estate, (iii) any act to create, perfect or enforce a lien against property of the estate and (iv) the setoff of prepetition debts owing to the debtor against debts owing by the debtor. The automatic stay ordinarily does not bar suits against non-debtor guarantors or co-obligors, nor does it enjoin payment under a letter of credit issued by a bank in favour of a creditor of the applicable debtor. Parties must apply to the bankruptcy court for relief from the stay prior to taking any action in violation of the stay. Any action in violation of the stay without prior relief is void and can be the basis for sanctions, including punitive damages. 360 ----- Applicable federal bankruptcy laws generally do not permit the payment or accrual of interest, costs and attorneys’ fees for unsecured or ‘‘undersecured’’ claims.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

The measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, a U.S. Guarantor would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than all of its assets, at a fair valuation; - the present fair salable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liabilities on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court may apply in making solvency determinations, and different courts may reach different conclusions with regard to these issues. For example, in an evidentiary ruling in the In re W.R. Grace & Co. bankruptcy case, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware held that under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, whether a transferor is rendered insolvent by a transfer depends on the actual liabilities of the transferor, and not what the transferor knows about such liabilities at the time of the transfer. Therefore, under that court’s analysis, liabilities that are unknown, or that are known to exist but whose magnitude is not fully appreciated at the time of the transfer, may be taken into account in the context of a future determination of insolvency. If the principle articulated by that court is upheld, it would make it very difficult to know whether a transferor is solvent at the time of transfer, and would increase the risk that a transfer may in the future be found to be a fraudulent transfer. The Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act has been enacted into law in Delaware at 6 Del. C. §§ 1301 et seq. and in Pennsylvania at 12 Pa. C.S.A. §§ 5101 et seq. By their terms, the Guarantee of each U.S. Guarantor will limit the liability of each such guarantor to the maximum amount it can pay without the Guarantee being deemed a fraudulent transfer. It is not assured, however, that this limitation will protect such guarantees from fraudulent transfer challenges or, if it does, that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would suffice, if necessary, to pay the Notes in full when due. In addition to the avoidance power that may be exercised in a U.S. bankruptcy, claims evidenced by the Guarantees may, in certain circumstances, be subordinated under the equitable subordination provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

With respect to foreign money judgments, recognition and enforceability will be governed by applicable state law. A majority of U.S. states, including Delaware and Pennsylvania, have adopted a version of the Uniform Foreign Money Judgments Recognition Act (or a later revision thereof) (the ‘‘U.S. _Recognition Act’’). Although variations exist among states, the U.S. Recognition Act generally applies to_ any judgment granting or denying recovery of a sum of money rendered in a foreign jurisdiction (excluding judgments for taxes, fines, penalties, matrimonial support and family matters), so long as the judgment is final, conclusive and enforceable in the jurisdiction where rendered. Pursuant to the U.S. Recognition Act, any such foreign judgment rendered by a court having proper personal and subject matter jurisdiction would, subject to considerations of public policy, be recognized and enforced by a U.S. state court that has adopted the U.S. Recognition Act (or a federal court sitting in such a state) and that also has appropriate personal and subject matter jurisdiction without re-examination of the merits of the case pursuant to which such foreign judgment was obtained and in the same manner as the judgment of a sister state that is entitled to full faith and credit, in an appropriate proceeding in accordance with the procedures of such court, provided that (i) the judgment debtor had received proper and sufficient notice of the subject proceedings, (ii) the judgment was not obtained by fraud or by procedures that denied the judgment debtor a fair trial before an impartial tribunal or due process of law, (iii) the proceedings in the foreign court were not contrary to an agreement between the parties under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in that court, (iv) the foreign court was not a seriously inconvenient forum for the trial of the action if jurisdiction over the judgment debtor was based only on personal service, and (v) the judgment did not conflict with another final and conclusive judgment. In addition to the foregoing, a number of states adopting the U.S. Recognition Act also require that the foreign court rendering the judgment reside in a jurisdiction that will reciprocally enforce judgments of the United States courts. In states that have not adopted the U.S. Recognition Act, principles of comity will apply. The U.S. Recognition Act represents an attempt to codify general principles of comity, and should therefore be generally indicative of the types of principles that non-U.S. Recognition Act states would apply in determining whether to recognize a foreign judgment against the U.S. Guarantors.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

Other than as described above, the ability of certain secured creditors to enforce their security interest may also be limited, in particular in the event of controlled management proceedings expressly providing that the rights of secured creditors are frozen until a final decision has been taken by a Luxembourg court as to the petition for controlled management, and may be affected thereafter by a reorganization order given by the court. A reorganisation order requires the prior approval by more than 50 per cent. of the creditors representing more than 50 per cent. of the Issuer or the Luxembourg Guarantor’s liabilities in order to take effect. Furthermore, you should note that declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default) may not be enforceable during controlled management proceedings. However, during such controlled management proceedings, a notice of default may still be served. Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the Issuer or the Luxembourg Guarantor during the preference period (p´eriode suspecte) which is a maximum of six months preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start of the suspect period at an earlier date. In particular: - pursuant to Article 445 of the Luxembourg code of commerce (Code de commerce), specified transactions (such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts save in 363 ----- respect of financial collateral arrangements within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Law 2005; payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; and the sale of assets without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the preference period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency receiver; - pursuant to Article 446 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, payments made for matured debts as well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the preference period are subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt party’s cessation of payments; and - pursuant to Article 448 of the Luxembourg code of commerce and Article 1167 of the Luxembourg civil code (action paulienne), the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) has the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit. In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in the automatic termination of contracts except for employment agreements and powers of attorney. The contracts, therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy order. However, the bankruptcy receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts so as to avoid worsening the financial situation of the company. As of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-`a-vis the bankruptcy estate. Insolvency proceedings may hence have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s or the Luxembourg Guarantor’s business and assets of the Issuer or Luxembourg Guarantor’s respective obligations under the Notes. Finally, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or composition proceedings may be subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation. In particular, rights in rem over assets located in another jurisdiction where the EU Insolvency Regulation applies will not be affected by the opening of insolvency proceedings, without prejudice however to the applicability of rules relating to the voidness, voidability or unenforceability of legal acts detrimental to all the creditors (subject to the application of Article 24 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 and Article 16 of the EU Insolvency Regulation).",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (together referred to as ‘‘insolvency proceedings’’) may be initiated against a company incorporated in Luxembourg having its centre of main interests (within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast) (the ‘‘EU _Insolvency Regulation’’) or an establishment in Luxembourg (in the latter case assuming that the centre of_ main interests is located in a jurisdiction where the EU Insolvency Regulation is applicable): - bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the company, by any of its creditors or by the courts _ex officio. Following such a request, the Luxembourg courts having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings if a Luxembourg company (i) is in a state of cessation of payments (cessation des paiements) and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (´ebranlement de _cr´edit). The main effect of such proceedings are the sale of the assets and allocation of the proceeds of_ such sale between creditors taking into account their rank of privilege, as well as the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the company, subject to certain limited exceptions under the applicable provision of the Luxembourg law of 5 August 2005 on financial collateral arrangements, as amended (the ‘‘Financial Collateral Law 2005’’)), for enforcement by secured creditors and the payment of the secured creditors in accordance with their rank upon realization of the assets. In addition, the managers or directors of a Luxembourg company that ceases its payments (i.e., is unable to pay its debts as they fall due with normal means of payment) must within a month of them having become aware of the company’s cessation of payments, file a petition for bankruptcy (faillite) with the court clerk of the district court of the company’s registered office. If the managers or directors fail to comply with such provision they may be held (i) liable towards the company or any third-parties on the basis of principles of managers’ and directors’ liability for any loss suffered and (ii) criminally liable 362 ----- for simple bankruptcy (banqueroute simple) in accordance with Article 574 of the Luxembourg commercial code; - controlled management proceedings (gestion contrˆol´ee), the opening of which may only be requested by the company and not by its creditors and under which a Luxembourg court may order the provisional stay of enforcement of claims except for secured creditors; or - composition proceedings (concordat pr´eventif de la faillite), the opening of which may only be requested by the company and not by its creditors directly. The Luxembourg court’s decision to admit a company to composition proceedings triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors except, among others, for secured creditors. In addition to these proceedings, your ability to receive payment under the Notes issued by the Issuer and the guarantees given by the Luxembourg Guarantors may be affected by a decision of a Luxembourg court to grant a stay on payments (sursis de paiement) or to put a Luxembourg company into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious breach or violation of the Luxembourg commercial code or of the Luxembourg Companies Law. The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow similar rules as those applicable to Luxembourg bankruptcy proceedings. Liability of the Issuer and the Luxembourg Guarantor in respect of the relevant Notes and Guarantees will, in the event of a liquidation of the company following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and any claims that are preferred under Luxembourg law. Preferential claims under Luxembourg law include, among others: - remuneration owed to employees (last six months’ wages amounting to a maximum of six times the minimum social salary); - employees’ contributions to social security; - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Inland Revenue; - employer’s contribution to social security; - landlord, pledgor not under the Financial Collateral Law 2005; and - value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to Luxembourg Customs and Excise.

A company may give a guarantee provided the giving of the guarantee is covered by the company’s corporate purpose, corporate benefit and is in the best interest of the company. Although no statutory definition of corporate benefit (int´erˆet social) exists under Luxembourg law, corporate benefit is widely interpreted and includes any transactions from which the company derives a direct or indirect economic or commercial benefit in return (such as an economic or commercial benefit) and whether the benefit is proportionate to the burden of the assistance. It is generally held that within a group of companies, the corporate interest of each individual corporate entity can include, to a certain extent, the interest of the group, and that the existence of a group interest can in certain cases result in the guarantee being held enforceable even where corporate benefit is not established. In this way, reciprocal assistance from one group company to another does not necessarily conflict with the interest of the assisting company. However, this assistance must be temporary, in proportion to the real financial means of the assisting company (i.e., limited to an aggregate amount not exceeding the assisting company’s own funds (capitaux _propres)), the company must receive some benefit or there must be a balance between the respective_ commitments of all the affiliates and the companies involved must form part of a genuine group operating under a common strategy aimed at a common objective.

Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognised or directly enforceable in England and Wales. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales, fresh proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In such an action, an English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defence to it). Summary judgment is a procedure by which the English court can dispose of all or part of a claim without proceeding to a full trial. Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action may be conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws principles and rules of English private international law at the time when proceedings were initiated (in other words, it does not matter that the U.S. court had jurisdiction according to its own law, but instead whether it had jurisdiction according to the rules of English private international law); - the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause except with the agreement of the relevant parties or the relevant parties’ subsequent submission to the jurisdiction of the court; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a debt for a definite sum of money; - the recognition or enforcement, as the case may be, of the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy, the European Convention on Human Rights or English law including the Human Rights Act 1998 (or any subordinate legislation made thereunder, to the extent applicable); - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a non-English penal or revenue law, or other public law; - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980; - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural justice; - there not having been a prior inconsistent, determinative or conflicting judgment of an English or other non-U.S. court in respect of the same matter involving the same parties and/or prior inconsistent judgment given in a Hague Convention member state or an EU Member State or other court which the English Court must recognise and enforce under the Hague Convention Choice of 371 ----- Court Agreements of 30 June 2005 and/or Council Regulation (EC) 1215/2012 and/or the Lugano Conventions of 1988 and 2007 or other law; - the U.S. judgment not having been wholly satisfied or not being enforceable by execution in the U.S.; - the party seeking enforcement providing security for costs, if ordered to do so by the English court; and - the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within the relevant limitation period. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in England and Wales in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognised or enforceable in England and Wales. In addition, it is questionable whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced in England and Wales, instead of the United States, in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws or other laws. Further, it may not be possible to obtain a judgment in England and Wales or to enforce the judgment if the judgment debtor is or becomes subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any setoff or counterclaim against the judgment creditor. Finally, note that, in any enforcement proceedings, the judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in England and Wales unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

Subject to the foregoing, it is uncertain to what extent investors may be able to enforce judgments in Denmark in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts.

KG. Service of process in Germany is generally effected by the court, not by the parties to the proceedings. Service of process from abroad must be effected in accordance with international treaties. In relation to the United States, the Hague Convention of 15 November 1965 on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters (the Hague Convention) will apply. Germany objected to the possibility of direct service of documents via mail provided for in art. 10 of the Hague Convention. Therefore, service has to be effected in a certain, formalized way via the diplomatic channels established between the other contracting state and Germany and will ultimately be effected by the local court where the defendant is resident. Documents will have to be accompanied by a translation into German. Alternatively, a German entity may agree to appoint a process agent abroad to accept service of documents in another jurisdiction. In that case, there will be no need to effect service according to international treaties and the service will be effected according to the laws of the country in which the process agent was appointed. 372 ----- Therefore, a final judgment for payment of money rendered by a federal or state court in the United States (a ‘‘U.S. court’’) based on civil liability may not be enforceable, either in whole or in part, in Germany. Notwithstanding the above, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability would generally be recognised by a German court upon satisfaction of all of the following conditions: (a) the judgment became final and binding (res judicata) in accordance with U.S. law; (b) U.S. courts could establish jurisdiction over the case in accordance with the principles on jurisdictional competence according to German law; (c) process has been duly served on the defendant in a timely fashion to allow for adequate defence or, in case of non-compliance, the defendant did appear in the proceedings and did not recourse to not being notified of the proceedings in a timely fashion that allowed for adequate defence; (d) the judgment is not contrary to (i) any prior judgment which became res judicata rendered by a German court or (ii) any prior judgment which became res judicata rendered by a foreign court which is to be recognised in Germany and the procedure leading to the respective judgment is not in contradiction to any such prior judgment under (i) and (ii) or a proceeding previously pending (rechtsh¨angig) in Germany; (e) the effects of its recognition will not be in conflict with material principles of German law, including, without limitation, fundamental rights under the constitution of Germany (Grundrechte). In this context, it should be noted that any component of a U.S. court’s civil judgment awarding punitive damages or any other damages which do not serve a compensatory purpose, such as treble damages, will likely not be enforced in Germany, on the basis of being in conflict with basic principles of German law; (f) the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is guaranteed; and (g) the judgment became res judicata in accordance with the law of the place where it was pronounced. Enforcement and foreclosure based on U.S. judgments may be sought against German defendants after having received an enforcement decision (exequatur) from a competent German court in accordance with the above principles. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in Germany in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, there can be no assurance that those judgments will be enforceable. In particular, the obligations need to be of a specific kind and type for which an enforcement procedure exists under German law. Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation or moratorium, as well as other similar laws affecting creditor’s rights generally. Furthermore, German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of aspects. With respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third-parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under German law. Under such circumstances, a judgment by a U.S. court against the Issuer or a Guarantor will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a judgment not in-line with the judgment rendered by a U.S. court.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

The competent Court of Appeal does not consider the merits of the case but exclusively ascertains the fulfilment of all the conditions set out above.

An enforceable judgment for the payment of monies rendered by any U.S. Federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. securities laws, would not directly be enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a party who received such favourable judgment in a U.S. court may initiate enforcement proceedings in Luxembourg (exequatur) by requesting enforcement of the U.S. judgment by the District Court (Tribunal d’Arrondissement) pursuant to Section 678 of the New Luxembourg Code of Civil Procedure. The District Court will authorize the enforcement in Luxembourg of the U.S. judgment if it is satisfied that all of the following conditions are met: - the U.S. judgment is enforceable (ex´ecutoire) in the United States; - the U.S. court awarding the judgment must have had jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matter both under applicable U.S. Federal or state jurisdictions rules, and under applicable Luxembourg international private law conflict of jurisdiction rules and local law; - the U.S. court has applied the substantive law as designated by Luxembourg conflict of laws rules, or at least, the order must not contravene the principles underlying those rules (based on case law and legal doctrine, it is not certain that this condition would still be required for an exequatur to be granted by a Luxembourg court); - the U.S. judgment does not contravene international public policy or order as understood under the laws of Luxembourg or has not been given in proceedings of a tax, penal or criminal nature (which would include awards of damages made under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, or other laws, to the extent that the same would be classified by Luxembourg courts as being of a penal or punitive nature (for example, fines or punitive damages)). Ordinarily an award of monetary 374 ----- damages would not be considered as a penalty, but if the monetary damages include punitive damages, such punitive damages may be considered as a penalty; - the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws; - the principles of fair trial and due process have been complied with and in particular the U.S. judgment was granted following proceedings where the counterparty had the opportunity to appear, and if it appeared, to present a defence; and - the U.S. judgment was not granted pursuant to an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude `a la loi _luxembourgeoise)._ Subject to the above conditions, Luxembourg courts tend not to review the merits of a foreign judgment, although there is no statutory prohibition to do so.

Also, an exequatur may be refused in respect of punitive damages. Further, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than euro, a Luxembourg court would have power to give judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than euro.

187,Offerings 2020.md,66,AVAILABLE INFORMATION,66.7,1 Our opinion is unmodified,66.7.1,,"We have audited the financial statements of Merlin Entertainments Limited (the Company) for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019 which comprise the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of financial position, consolidated statement of changes in equity, consolidated statement of cash flows, Company statement of financial position, Company statement of changes in equity, and the related notes, including the accounting policies in note 1.1. In our opinion: - the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 28 December 2019 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; - the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU); - the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; and - the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities are described below. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and are independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities.

187,Offerings 2020.md,66,AVAILABLE INFORMATION,66.8,2 Material uncertainty related to going concern,66.8.1,,"We draw attention to note 1.1 to the financial statements which indicates that the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic mean that the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in a severe but plausible downside scenario are dependent on cash injections from the consortium of investors in the Company’s ultimate parent company (Motion JVCO Limited), the confirmation (already received) that Motion JVCO Limited will not seek the repayment of preference shares held as debt and parent company loans and/or the extension of further bank facilities. These events and conditions, along with the other matters explained in note 1.1, constitute a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Group and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter. The risk: disclosure quality There is little judgement involved in the Directors’ conclusion that risks and circumstances described in note 1.1 to the financial statements represent a material uncertainty over the ability of the Group and Company to continue as a going concern for a period of at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements. However, clear and full disclosure of the facts and the Directors’ rationale for the use of the going concern basis of preparation, including that there is a related material uncertainty, is a key financial statement disclosure and so was the focus of our audit in this area. Auditing standards require that to be reported as a key audit matter. Our response: Our procedures included: _Assessing transparency: assessing the completeness and accuracy of the matters_ covered in the going concern disclosure by; - Evaluating the processes and models used by management in its assessment; - Evaluating whether the assumptions are realistic and achievable and consistent with the external and/or internal environment and other matters identified in the audit; - Evaluating management’s assessment of the entity’s compliance with debt covenants; and - Assessing the reasonableness of management’s budgets/forecasts including comparisons to past performance and the evaluation of downside sensitivities.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

187,Offerings 2020.md,66,AVAILABLE INFORMATION,66.10,The risk** **Our response,66.10.1,,"Carrying value of Resort Theme Parks (RTP) goodwill £202 million (2018: £212 million) Refer to pages F31 to F32 (accounting policy) and pages F32 to F33 (financial disclosures) Risk vs. 2018: _decreasing Forecast based valuation: A history of business combinations has resulted in significant goodwill balances. The RTP Operating Group is capital intensive and unlike the other Operating Groups has not generated headroom via growth from new site openings. As RTP has been impaired in the past and has a small amount of headroom, there is a risk that its goodwill will not be supportable by its continuing operations. The estimated recoverable amount is subjective due to the inherent uncertainty involved in a forecast based valuation, particularly the estimate of forecast cash flows. The effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the forecast future cash flows used in calculating the value in use of Resort Theme Parks has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount. The financial statements (note 3.3) disclose the sensitivities estimated by the Group. Our procedures included: Historical comparisons: - assessing the historical accuracy of the Group’s forecasting over a five year period and building comparable variations in forecasting accuracy into our own models that were used to re-perform the valuation; - evaluating expected changes in site-level cash flows (from activities such as new promotions and customer experience improvements) and the planned cost base, in light of the past results of similar activities carried out by the Group; Sensitivity analysis: assessing the reasonableness of management’s sensitivity analysis, including calculating the impact of changes in key assumptions, performing breakeven analysis of the earnings multiple, discount rates, forecast cash flows, and modelling the cash flows of a base case scenario; Comparing valuations: comparing the sum of the discounted cash flows across the Group with the expected value of the business based on a recently observable sale of the Group; and Assessing transparency: assessing whether the Group’s sensitivity disclosures regarding the impairment testing adequately reflects the risks inherent in the valuation of goodwill. Our results We found the resulting estimate of the recoverable amount of RTP goodwill to be acceptable _(2018: acceptable)._ ----- ## INDEPENDENT  AUDITOR’S REPORT ##### To the Members of Merlin Entertainments Limited Visitor and accommodation revenue recognition: £1,672 million (2018: £1,586 million) Refer to page F18 (accounting policy) and pages F17 to F18 (financial disclosures). Risk vs 2018: stable Recoverability of the parent Company’s investment in and amounts owed by Group undertakings Investments in subsidiaries £3,160 million _(2018: £3,137 million), Amounts owed by_ Group undertakings £46 million current, £3,843 million non-current (2018: £4 million _current, £1,260 million non-current)_ Refer to pages F61 to F66 (accounting policy and financial disclosures). Risk vs 2018: increased Processing error: Merlin’s revenues come from a number of different channels, locations and systems, sometimes featuring manual processes to match past purchases to redemptions or to transfer data to the finance systems. The low value of individual transactions means individual errors would be insignificant, however the high volume of transactions mean systemic failure could lead to difficulty in detecting errors that, in aggregate, may have a material impact. Low risk, high value: The carrying amount of the parent Company’s investment in its subsidiary and the amounts owed by Group undertakings represents 100% (2018: 99.9%) of the parent Company’s total assets. Their recoverability is not at a high risk of significant misstatement or subject to significant judgement. However, due to their materiality in the context of the parent Company financial statements, this is considered to be the area that has had the greatest effect on our overall parent Company audit. Our procedures included: Control design and operation: testing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of manual controls supporting revenue recognition, including reconciliations of till records to cash banked and to revenue journal entries in the accounting records; IT controls: at certain sites, where we anticipated being able to rely on such systems, testing of the general IT control environment of the systems used to record revenue and evaluating controls over the revenue process including their operating effectiveness; Expectation vs outcome: forming an expectation for revenue by analysing total cash received per bank statements as adjusted for non-revenue transactions, sales taxes collected and balance sheet movements and comparing this expectation to revenue recognised; and Tests of detail: - agreeing a sample of revenue transactions to bank statements or other supporting documentation. - testing deferred revenue balances through agreement to ticketing system records and reperforming specific manual calculations. The extent of this testing reflected the outcome of our controls testing at each location. Our results We found the revenue amounts recognised to be acceptable (2018: acceptable). Our procedures included: Comparing valuations: comparing the carrying amount of the investment with the expected value of the business based on the recently observable sale of the Group. Assessing component audits: assessing the work performed by the component audit team on those components and considering the results of that work, on those components’ profits and net assets. Our results We found the Group’s assessment of the recoverability of the investment in and amounts owed by Group undertakings to be acceptable (2018: acceptable). ----- ## INDEPENDENT  AUDITOR’S REPORT ##### To the Members of Merlin Entertainments Limited",N/A,as_expected,2020,604
187,Offerings 2020.md,66,AVAILABLE INFORMATION,66.12,4 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit,66.12.1,,"Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £12,250,000 _(2018: £14,300,000), determined with reference to a benchmark of Group_ underlying profit before tax, of which it represents 5.2% (2018: 5.0% of Group _profit before tax). We consider Group underlying profit before tax to be the most_ appropriate benchmark as it provides a more stable measure year on year than group profit before tax due to the value of exceptional items in the year and therefore we have changed our benchmark from 2018. Materiality for the parent Company financial statements as a whole was set at £2,500,000 (2018: _£4,500,000), determined by reference to component materiality. This is lower_ than the materiality we would otherwise have determined by reference to total assets, and represents 0.04% of the parent Company’s total assets (2018: 0.1%). We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements affecting profit exceeding £600,000 (2018: £715,000) or otherwise exceeding £2,000,000 (2018: £2,000,000), in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. The components within the scope of our work accounted for the percentages illustrated opposite. This also includes procedures on finance costs and assets established on consolidation; the total of these balances were audited at Group level. Full scope audits for Group reporting purposes were performed at 31 components in the following countries: Australia, China (including Hong Kong), Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, Thailand, UK and USA. The 21 components for which we performed specified risk-focused audit procedures or analysis at an aggregated Group level were not individually significant but were included in the scope of our Group reporting work to provide further coverage. We select these components on a rotational basis, setting a financial threshold on each of the Group profit before tax, Group revenue and Group property, plant and equipment and using our assessment of risk to select a sample of sites from those that meet at least one of these thresholds. The remaining 8% of total Group profit before tax, 15% of Group revenue and 15% of Group property, plant and equipment is represented by a large number of smaller reporting components, none of which individually represented more than 2.7% of any of the total profits or losses that made up Group profit before tax, total Group revenue or total Group property, plant and equipment. For these residual components, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to reexamine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these. The Group team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back. The Group team approved each component materiality, which ranged from £500,000 to £6,000,000 (2018: £500,000 to £4,500,000), having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components. The Group audit team carried out audits for Group reporting purposes of the financial information of components covering 41% _(2018: 19%) of the total profits and losses that made up Group profit before tax, including the audit of the parent Company. The Group audit team also undertook all audit procedures of certain total Group account balances as mentioned above, covering a further 1% _(2018: _4%) of total profits and losses that made up Group profit before tax._ The Group team visited two (2018: one) overseas component locations in Italy and Australia (2018: California) to assess the audit risk and strategy. Additionally we performed inspection of the work covering the key audit matters at all component audit teams performing audits for Group reporting purposes. Teleconference meetings were held with all component auditors. At these meetings, the Group audit team provided further input to audit risk and strategy, and the findings reported to the Group team were discussed in more detail. Any further work required by the Group team was then performed by the component auditor. The Group team also routinely reviews the audit documentation of all component audits. This year for two components in China, where the coronavirus prevented entry to the country and remote access to audit documentation is prohibited, we instead extended our oversight of those component teams through extended telephone discussions and expanded reporting.

187,Offerings 2020.md,569,1.1** **BASIS OF PREPARATION,569.1,Going concern,569.1.1,,"The Group reported a profit for the year of £122 million (2018 as restated: £220 million) and generated operating cash inflows of £460 million (2018 as restated: _£532 million). Notwithstanding net liabilities of £421 million as at 28 December 2019, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern_ basis. The Directors consider this to be appropriate for the reasons as set out below. Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic As at the date of approving these financial statements, the impact of COVID-19 on the Group’s trading is continually being assessed and subject to rapid change. Currently substantially all of the Group’s attractions are closed. While regional variations are anticipated, our ‘base case’ assumption is that this situation continues until mid-May. We then anticipate governmental restrictions on businesses opening and the ability of citizens to move freely may lift. This base case then assumes a gradual recovery to more normalised trading levels in the following weeks, such that once attractions are open ongoing revenue would recover to over 90% of normal levels after two months. The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for a period of 18 months from the date of approval of these financial statements which indicate that in this scenario, the Group will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities as they fall due for that period. Under this scenario there would be no breach of lending facilities as they enable trading shocks of this nature to be taken into account within the covenant calculations. There are no material capital repayments of debt falling due within the forecast period. During this period the business is currently taking appropriate measures to preserve liquidity. The following mitigating actions have been built into the base case scenario; - The Group has drawn down all the £400 million RCF available under the Motion JVCO Limited Group’s financing facilities (see below). Cash on hand at the end of March 2020 totalled approximately £514 million. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the Company to move cash around the Group. - A significant element of the Group’s cost base relates to wages and salaries, including in respect of seasonal staff that work in the Group’s theme parks and other attractions over the peak summer trading period. Recruitment of these staff is being delayed as events unfold. Additionally, some of our staff work under ‘variable hours’ contracts that enable a level of flexibility. Where possible, and subject to local regulations, staffing levels and the hours operated are being reduced. Regarding permanent staff members, in certain territories government assistance is available to offset costs that continue to be incurred. - We have rephased or delayed capital expenditure. While the Group’s future growth plans include significant new business development capital expenditure, much of this is not currently contracted and can therefore be delayed. Where it is has become impossible to continue construction because of local restrictions, this also helps to preserve cash. The most significant of these projects is LEGOLAND New York where construction is currently on hold but is planned to recommence when possible to ensure an opening in Spring 2021. Essential capital expenditure to ensure the health and safety of our guests and staff has continued where required prior to the re-opening of attractions that are currently closed. - We have agreed certain rent deferrals and rent-free periods with a number of landlords. - We are taking advantage of the UK Government rates relief, and concessions over tax payments in various countries. - In the first half of the year we would normally be incurring marketing expenditure such as TV advertising to drive summer trading. Reflecting the timing of when such expenditure is normally committed, we have been able to delay and/or cancel such expenditure in several territories. Other variable expenditure has also been reduced where possible. ----- ## SECTION 1 ##### CONTINUED ## BASIS OF PREPARATION 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019 (2018: 52 weeks ended 29 December 2018)",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

The accounting policy for each type of financial instrument is included within the relevant note. Financial assets are initially measured at fair value, unless otherwise noted, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss. A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or the Group transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, plus, in the case of other financial liabilities, directly attributable transaction costs. Other financial liabilities, primarily the Group’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings and parent company loans and preference shares, are measured at amortised cost. Financial liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss and are held on the statement of financial position at fair value. A financial liability is derecognised when the Group’s obligations are discharged, expire or are cancelled. Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance costs. An equity instrument is any contract that has a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.

It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Judgements Management considers the following areas to be the judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. They are explained in more detail in the related notes: - Useful life of brands (note 3.2) - where brands have been recognised as part of an acquisition, they have been assessed as having indefinite useful lives and management have considered that this judgement remains appropriate. - Goodwill impairment reviews (note 3.3) - the level at which goodwill is initially allocated and thereafter monitored. Estimates Management considers the following area to involve a significant degree of estimation uncertainty: - Valuation of Resort Theme Parks Operating Group (RTP) assets and impairment (note 3.3) - estimation of discounted cash flows when calculating the value in use of assets. Other non-significant areas that include a degree of estimation uncertainty are: - Valuation of assets and impairment, excluding RTP (note 3.3) - estimation of discounted cash flows when calculating the value in use of assets. - Taxation (note 2.4) - recognition of deferred tax balances and accounting for tax risks. - Provisions (note 3.5) - estimated outflow to settle the obligation and, where relevant, the appropriate discount and inflation rates to apply. - Interest-bearing loans and borrowings (note 4.2) - expected period of borrowings when calculating the effective interest rate on those borrowings. - Investments (note 5.1) - earnings multiple when calculating the fair value of investments. - Employee benefits (note 5.2) - assumed discount rate, inflation rate and mortality when valuing defined benefit liabilities.

When accounting for revenue, Merlin makes an assessment, considering the control principles of IFRS 15, as to whether parties involved in providing goods or services to a customer are acting as a principal (if they control delivery to the customer) or, if they are arranging for those goods or services to be provided by the other party, as an agent. - Visitor revenue - represents admissions tickets, retail, food and beverage sales and other commercial offerings such as photos and games experiences inside a Merlin attraction. Tickets, annual passes and other services can be bought in advance, generally online, in which case these advanced revenues are held in deferred revenue until the visitor uses those tickets or services. Visitor revenue is therefore recognised when the visitor enters the attraction. Revenue from annual passes and other tickets that entitle a customer to continued visits over a period of time is deferred and then recognised evenly over the period that the pass is valid. Retail and food and beverage revenue, along with other similar commercial offerings, is recognised at point of sale. - Accommodation revenue - represents overnight stay and conference room revenue along with food and beverage revenue earned within our hotels and other accommodation offerings. Accommodation revenue is recognised at the time when a customer stays at Merlin accommodation. - Other revenue - represents sponsorship, function, management and service contract revenue along with other sundry items. Sponsorship revenue is recognised over the relevant contract term. Function revenue is recognised at the time of the event.

187,Offerings 2020.md,570,1.1** **BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED),570.14,,570.14.1,,"Downside scenario It is currently very difficult to assess how the COVID-19 situation will evolve. The Directors believe the base case scenario above is reasonable, assuming as it does a shut-down of the entire trading estate for two months, and a phased level of recovery. However, it is possible that site closures may continue for a longer period, and/or that the recovery profile is slower than in the base case. The Directors have therefore prepared a more severe downside scenario that models a four month shut-down lasting until mid-July 2020, with a slower recovery profile than in the base case, such that once attractions are then open it would be more than five months before ongoing revenue would recover to over 90% of normal levels. Consistent with the base case, this scenario would not give rise to a breach of the covenants in the debt facilities. The ability to adjust for trading shocks of this nature remains available during the term of debt facilities. In this situation, without any new sources of funds, the Group’s currently available liquidity could be exhausted during Q3 2020. Were the Group to require access to further liquidity, this could be sought through cash injections from the consortium of investors in the Company’s ultimate parent company Motion JVCO Limited, and/or the extension of further lending facilities. Given the Company’s history of cash generation we would expect to be able to raise such funds as were necessary, however there is no guarantee that such funds will be available. Access to wider Group facilities The base case forecasts and downside sensitivities noted above partly depend on the ultimate parent company, Motion JVCO Limited, not seeking repayment of the preference shares held as debt and parent company loans, which at 28 December 2019 amounted to £2,120 million and £758 million respectively. Motion JVCO Limited has indicated its intention not to seek repayment of the amounts due at the balance sheet date, for the period covered by the forecasts. Motion JVCO Limited has also indicated that the £400 million RCF noted above is solely available for the Group and will not be used for any other purpose. As with any company placing reliance on other group entities for financial support, the Directors acknowledge that there can be no certainty that this support will continue although, at the date of approval of these financial statements, they have no reason to believe that it will not do so. Based on these indications the Directors believe that it remains appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. However, these circumstances represent a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and, therefore, to continue realising its assets and discharging its liabilities in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result from the basis of preparation being inappropriate. - Existing finance leases have also been reviewed against the new standard. As a result a number of leases entered into under historic sale and leaseback transactions have been re-assessed due to differences in the accounting treatment between IAS 17 and IFRS 16 of unguaranteed residual values. This has required re-assessment of the values of leased assets at inception and their treatment under IFRS 16 in subsequent periods. Regarding classification, these assets were accounted for as PPE under IAS 17 but are treated as ROU assets under IFRS 16. - The Group has elected to take recognition exemptions for short term leases and leases of low-value items. Leases that fall within the Group’s defined parameters for these exemptions have been excluded from the IFRS 16 lease accounting requirements and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. _Judgements and estimates_ IFRS 16 requires certain judgements and estimates to be made. The most significant of these relate to the following: - The discount rate used in the calculation of the lease liability, which involves estimation. Discount rates are calculated on a lease by lease basis. For the property leases that make up substantially all of the Group’s lease portfolio this results in two approaches. For a small volume of high value leases, the rate implicit in the lease can be calculated and is therefore adopted. Otherwise, for the majority of leases the rate used is based on estimates of incremental borrowing costs. These will depend on the territory of the relevant lease and hence the currency used; the date of lease inception; and the lease term. As a result, reflecting the breadth of the Group’s lease portfolio; the transition approach adopted which has required estimation of historic discount rates; and estimations as to lease lives, there are a large number of discount rates used within a wide range. - IFRS 16 defines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease together with the options to extend or terminate a lease, if the lessee were reasonably certain to exercise that option. Where a lease includes the option for the Group to extend the lease term, the Group makes a judgement as to whether it is reasonably certain that the option will be taken. This will take into account the length of time remaining before the option is exercisable; current trading; future trading forecasts as to the ongoing profitability of the attraction; and the level and type of planned future capital investment. A small number of large leases held by the Group came into effect as part of a sale and leaseback transaction that occurred in 2007. These leases have an initial lease period of 35 years, with an option to extend for two further periods of 35 years, subject to an adjustment to market rates at that time. At this point it is not reasonably certain that these leases will be renewed, taking into account the factors noted above. This judgement is reassessed at each reporting period. A reassessment of the remaining life of the lease could result in a recalculation of the lease liability and a material adjustment to the associated balances. _Transition approach and impact_ The Group has applied IFRS 16 from 30 December 2018, using the fully retrospective approach. Therefore, the cumulative effect of adopting IFRS 16 has been recognised, in line with IAS 8 ‘Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors’, by restating the 52 week period ended 29 December 2018 and making an opening equity adjustment as at 31 December 2017. The Group is not required to make any adjustment for leases in which it is a lessor except where it is an intermediate lessor in a sub-lease. The Group has applied the practical expedient to grandfather the definition of a lease on transition. This means that IFRS 16 has been applied to all contracts entered into before 30 December 2018 and identified as leases in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4. The impact on transition can be summarised as follows: 29 December 2018 30 December 2017 as IFRS 16 as as IFRS 16 as reported adjustment restated reported adjustment restated £m £m £m £m £m £m Property, plant and equipment 2,344 (175) 2,169 2,092 (169) 1,923 Right-of-use assets - 993 993 - 966 966 Deferred tax assets 35 33 68 33 30 63 Trade and other receivables (current) 125 (3) 122 100 (3) 97 Lease liabilities (current and non-current) (200) (983) (1,183) (191) (947) (1,138) Provisions (current and non-current) (88) 1 (87) (77) 1 (76) Trade and other payables (current and non-current) (400) 29 (371) (334) 27 (307) Net impact to equity** (105) (95) The ROU assets above include balances relating to leases previously accounted for as finance leases, as well as asset retirement provisions on leased properties. Both of these items were previously classified under property, plant and equipment. The Group has recognised total lease liabilities of £1,183 million at 29 December 2018. This included existing finance lease liabilities of £200 million so the impact of adopting IFRS 16 was therefore £983 million. Under IAS 17, at the same date the Group reported future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases on an undiscounted basis totalling £1,852 million. ----- ## SECTION 1 ##### CONTINUED ## BASIS OF PREPARATION 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019 (2018: 52 weeks ended 29 December 2018) The transition to IFRS 16 resulted in the restatement of the December 2018 income statement as follows: 29 December 29 December 2018 Discontinued 2018 as IFRS 16 operations as reported adjustment (note 2.5) restated Continuing operations_ £m £m £m £m Gross profit** 1,390 - (32) 1,358 Staff expenses, marketing and other expenses (791) 2 19 (770) Rent (105) 82 1 (22) Underlying EBITDA** 494 84 (12) 566 Depreciation and amortisation (167) (45) 3 (209) Underlying operating profit** 327 39 (9) 357 Finance income 10 - - 10 Finance costs (48) (52) 1 (99) Underlying profit before tax** 289 (13) (8) 268 The transition to IFRS 16 resulted in the restatement of the December 2018 cash flow statement as follows: 29 December 29 December 2018 Discontinued 2018 as IFRS 16 operations as reported adjustment (note 2.5) restated £m £m £m £m Net cash inflow from operating activities 450 82 - 532 Net cash outflow from investing activities (317) - - (317) Net cash outflow from financing activities (335) (82) - (417) Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents** (202) - - (202) The adjustment to the net cash inflow from operating activities includes the impact to profit for the period, being a reduction in profit of £10 million.

The tax charge comprises both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods. Deferred tax is provided on certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and taxation purposes respectively. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period. After considering forecast future profits, deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those assets can be utilised. This assessment is made after considering a number of factors, including the Group’s future trading expectations. Provisions for uncertain tax positions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and management judge that it is probable that there will be a future outflow of economic benefits to settle that obligation. Uncertain tax positions are assessed and measured on an issue by issue basis within the jurisdictions that we operate using management’s estimate of the most likely outcome. A combination of in-house tax experts, previous experience and professional firms is used when assessing uncertain tax positions. ----- ## SECTION 2 ##### CONTINUED ## RESULTS FOR THE YEAR 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019 (2018: 52 weeks ended 29 December 2018)",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

The difference between the reported ETR of 39.8% and the UK standard tax rate of 19.0% is largely due to exceptional items associated with the acquisition of the Group. Excluding these exceptional items, the underlying ETR is 28.6% (2018 as restated: 18.4%). The difference between the underlying ETR and the UK standard rate is attributable to a number of factors including the Group’s geographic mix of profits, non-deductible interest expense in the UK and USA and the nonrecognition of tax losses. The increase in the underlying ETR compared to the prior year is primarily due to the items mentioned above. Significant factors impacting the Group’s future ETR include the ability to obtain effective relief for the interest expense and changes to local or international tax laws. Revisions to the allocation of taxing rights, as envisaged in the OECD’s proposals in relation to Pillar One and Pillar Two could have a material impact on the Group’s ETR. The impact of the the European Commission’s finding relating to the UK’s Controlled Foreign Company rules is further detailed in note 5.4. A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 19% to 17% (effective from 1 April 2020) was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016, and the UK deferred tax asset as at 28 December 2019 has been calculated based on this rate. In the 11 March 2020 Budget it was announced that the UK tax rate will remain at the current 19% and not reduce to 17% from 1 April 2020. This will have a consequential effect on the Group’s future tax charge. If this rate change had been substantively enacted at the current balance sheet date the deferred tax asset would have increased by £3 million. Otherwise, the Group's future ETR will primarily be affected by the geographic mix of profits. ----- ## SECTION 2 ##### CONTINUED ## RESULTS FOR THE YEAR 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019 (2018: 52 weeks ended 29 December 2018)",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

Where components of an item of PPE have different useful lives, they are accounted for separately. The initial cost of PPE includes all costs incurred in bringing the asset into use and includes external costs for the acquisition, construction and commissioning of the asset, internal project costs (primarily staff expenses) and capitalised borrowing costs. Assets acquired through business combinations At the time of a business combination PPE is separately recognised and valued. Given the specialised nature of the PPE acquired, fair values are calculated on a depreciated replacement cost basis. The key estimates are the replacement cost, where industry specific indices are used to restate original historic cost; and depreciation, where the total and remaining economic useful lives are considered, together with the residual value of each asset. The total estimated lives applied are consistent with those set out below. Residual values are based on industry specific indices. New sites Capital expenditure on new attractions includes all the costs of bringing the items of PPE within that attraction into use ready for the opening of the attraction. Pre-opening costs are only capitalised to the extent they are required to bring PPE into its working condition. Other pre-opening costs are expensed as incurred. Existing sites Subsequent expenditure on items of PPE in our existing estate can be broadly split into two categories: - Capital expenditure which adds new items of PPE to an attraction or which extends the operational life, or enhances existing items, of PPE is accounted for as an addition to PPE. Examples of such expenditure include new rides or displays and enhancements to rides or displays, which increase the appeal of our attractions to visitors. - Expenditure which is incurred to maintain the items of PPE in a safe and useable state and to maintain the useful life of items of PPE is charged to the income statement as incurred. Examples of such expenditure include regular servicing and maintenance of buildings, rides and displays and ongoing repairs to items of PPE. Depreciation Land is not depreciated. Assets under construction are not depreciated until they come into use, when they are transferred to buildings or plant and equipment as appropriate. Depreciation is then charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of PPE.

The Group uses EBITDA less an allocation of central costs, in line with other recharges which occur in the business, as a proxy for the operating cash flows of its attractions as they are not significantly impacted by movements in working capital. Growth in EBITDA EBITDA is forecast by an analysis of both projected revenues and costs. Visitor numbers and revenue projections are based on market analysis, including the total available market, historic trends, competition and site development activity, both in terms of capital expenditure on rides and attractions as well as marketing activity. Projections of operating costs are based on historical data, adjusted for variations in visitor numbers and planned expansion of site activities as well as general market conditions. Timing and quantum of future capital and maintenance expenditure Projections are based on the attractions’ long term development plans, taking into account the capital investment necessary to maintain and sustain the performance of the attractions’ assets. Long term growth rate A growth rate of 2.5% (2018: 2.5%) was determined based on management’s long term expectations, taking account of historical averages and future expected trends in both market development and market share growth. Discount rates to reflect the risks involved Based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital of a ‘market participant’ within the main geographical regions where the Group operates, these are drawn from market data and businesses in similar sectors, and adjusted for asset specific risks. The key assumptions of the ‘market participant’ include the ratio of debt to equity financing, risk free rates and the medium term risks associated with equity investments. Net present values are calculated using pre-tax discount rates derived from the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital. When considering the impact of IFRS 16, there was insufficient observable market data to determine a market participant discount rate that included leases. Therefore the Group used discount rates and cash flows on an unadjusted pre-IFRS 16 basis, then adjusting for the market movement in lease discount rates since inception by adjusting for the difference in the carrying value and fair value of the lease liability. ----- ## SECTION 3  OPERATING ASSETS ##### CONTINUED ## AND LIABILITIES 52 weeks ended 28 December 2019 (2018: 52 weeks ended 29 December 2018)",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

Sensitivity analysis has therefore been performed on the calculated recoverable amounts considering incremental changes in the key assumptions. Particular focus is given to material amounts where headroom is more limited. As in prior years, this solely relates to goodwill attributed to the Resort Theme Parks Operating Group (RTP) where the headroom is £460 million (2018: £93 million). The headroom in 2019 is augmented by the application of IFRS 16 to certain large leases within RTP, that came into effect as part of a sale and leaseback transaction in 2007 (see notes 1.1 and 4.4). The Midway Attractions and LEGOLAND Parks Operating Groups, as well as individual brands, show considerable headroom and are not sensitive to even significant changes in any of the key assumptions. In undertaking sensitivity analysis for RTP, consideration has been given to movements in forecast EBITDA, increases in discount rates and reductions in long term growth rates. At the year end the Directors consider that the forecasts used reflect the current best estimate of future trading in RTP. It is noted, however, that the calculations are inherently sensitive to the level of growth within RTP, which may be affected by factors such as weather patterns and the wider economic trading environment. While in the short term slower growth would be highly unlikely to affect valuations by a substantial amount, longer term shortfalls that affect the outlook for the fourth year of the plan (which drives the terminal value) would have a more significant impact. If EBITDA for RTP as a whole was forecast to be 38% (2018: 9%) lower than currently anticipated for 2024 (2018: than anticipated for 2023), headroom would be absorbed in full. Discount rates have been derived from market data. As these rates are intended to be long term in nature they are expected to be reasonably stable in the short term, however market discount rates could increase in future. If the discount rate used across RTP had been higher by a factor of 62% to 14.8% (2018: 8% to 10.6%), headroom would have been absorbed in full. The long term growth rate, which is applied to the cash flows of the final year in the business plan, was determined based on management’s long term expectations, taking account of historical averages and future expected trends in both market development and market share growth.

The Group has a policy of actively managing its interest rate risk exposure using a combination of fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps. At 28 December 2019 the Group had £1,544 million of fixed rate debt comprising: - $400 million of 5.75% notes to mature in 2026; - $410 million and €370 million of preference shares; - €703 million of parent company loans; In aggregate 48% (2018: 77%) of the year end interest-bearing loans and borrowings is at a fixed rate for a weighted average period of 7 years (2018: 4.6 years). To achieve the desired balance of fixed and floating interest rates across currencies, the Group uses both floating to fixed interest rate swaps (which are part of cash flow hedging relationships) and fixed to floating interest rate swaps (which are part of fair value hedging relationships). Interest rate swaps are recognised at fair value which is determined by reference to market rates. The fair value is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to exit the swap, taking into account current interest rates, credit risks and bid/ask spreads. Following initial recognition, changes in fair value are recognised immediately in profit or loss, except where the Group adopts hedge accounting. When hedge accounting, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items. It makes an assessment, at inception and on an ongoing basis, as to whether the hedging instruments are expected to be ‘highly effective’ in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the respective hedged items during the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity. Any ineffective portion of changes in fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Cumulative gains and losses would remain in equity until either the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, or until the hedged transaction occurs, at which point they will be reclassified to profit or loss. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the fair value adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised to profit and loss from that date. At 28 December 2019 the Group had £nil (2018: €40 million, $120 million) of fair value interest rates swaps. A 100 basis points fall in the interest rates with a similar duration as the swaps would lead to an increase in value of £nil (2018: £8 million) and a 100 basis points rise in the interest rates with a similar duration as the swaps would lead to a decrease in value of £nil (2018: £7 million). All interest rate swaps held by the Group were hedge accounted. Sensitivity analysis Based on the net debt position as at 28 December 2019 a 100 basis points rise in market interest rates would result in an increase in net interest paid of £15 million _(2018: £2 million) and a 100 basis points fall in market interest rates would result in an decrease in net interest paid of £12 million (2018: £2 million).

The Group’s potential currency exposures comprise transaction and translation exposures. The Group ensures that its net exposure to foreign currency balances is kept to a minimal level by using foreign currency swaps to exchange balances back into Sterling or by buying and selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts is the present value of future cash flows and is determined by reference to market rates. At 29 December 2019 the fair value of foreign currency swap assets was £2 million (2018: less than £1 million) and the foreign currency swap liabilities was £2 million _(2018: £4 million), none of which are hedge accounted._ Transaction exposures The revenue and costs of the Group’s operations are denominated primarily in the currencies of the relevant local territories. Any significant cross-border trading exposures would be hedged by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts. Translation exposures The Group’s results, as presented in Sterling, are subject to fluctuations as a result of exchange rate movements. The Group does not hedge this translation exposure to its earnings but, where material, may carry out net asset hedging by borrowing in the same currencies as the currencies of its operating units or by using forward foreign exchange contracts. The Group’s debt (excluding lease liabilities) is therefore denominated in Euros, US Dollars and Sterling and at 28 December 2019 consisted of €1,862 million, $2,020 million and £49 million and there are forward foreign exchange contracts in place in respect of JPY 13,440 million. Gains or losses arise on the retranslation of the net assets of foreign operations at different reporting dates and are recognised within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. They will predominantly relate to the retranslation of opening net assets at closing foreign exchange rates, together with the retranslation of retained foreign profits for the year (that have been accounted for in the consolidated income statement at average rates) at closing rates. Exchange rates for major currencies are set out below. Gains or losses also arise on the retranslation of foreign currency denominated borrowings designated as effective net investment hedges of overseas net assets. These are offset in equity by corresponding gains or losses arising on the retranslation of the related hedged foreign currency net assets. The Group also treats specific intercompany loan balances, which are not intended to be repaid in the foreseeable future, as part of its net investment. In the event of a foreign entity being sold or a hedging item being extinguished, such exchange differences would be recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.

Historically the leases were accounted for as finance or operating leases depending on the specific circumstances of each lease and the nature of the attraction. For certain of the sites an individual lease agreement was split for accounting purposes as a combination of finance and operating leases, reflecting the varied nature of assets at the attraction. This led to differing treatments on the adoption of IFRS 16. Each of these sale and leaseback agreements runs for a period of 35 years from inception and allows for annual rent increases based on the inflationary index in the United Kingdom and fixed increases in Continental Europe. The Group has the option, but is not contractually required, to extend each of the lease agreements individually for two further terms of 35 years, subject to an adjustment to market rates at that time. LEGOLAND Japan was opened during 2017. The park was developed under the Group’s ‘operated and leased’ model whereby the Group’s local operating company leases the site and park infrastructure from a development partner. The development partners are related parties, being KIRKBI Invest A/S and LLJ Investco K.K, a subsidiary of KIRKBI A/S. KIRKBI A/S is a shareholder of the Group and a related party (note 5.3). The lease is for a period of 50 years and previously was accounted for partly as a finance lease and partly as an operating lease depending on the nature of the underlying assets concerned. Land and longer life assets, for example core elements of the park’s infrastructure, were accounted for as operating leases. Finance lease assets were those elements that will be substantially or entirely consumed over the lease term. This accounting judgement was underpinned by a review of the cost of construction by asset type together with estimates of the lives of the assets concerned. The Group also enters into leases for sites within the Midway Attractions Operating Group and central areas. These are typically of a duration between 10 and 60 years, with rent increases determined based on local market practice. In addition to a fixed rental element, rents within the Midway Attractions Operating Group can also contain a performance related element, typically based on turnover at the site concerned. Options to renew leases exist at these sites in line with local market practice in the territories concerned. The key contractual terms in relation to each lease are considered when calculating the rental charge over the lease term. The potential impact on rent charges of future performance or increases based on inflationary indices are each excluded from these calculations. There are no significant operating restrictions placed on the Group as a result of its lease arrangements.

There are no externally imposed capital requirements on the Group. To enable the Group to meet its objective, the Directors monitor returns on capital through constant review of earnings generated from the Group’s capital investment programme and through regular budgeting and planning processes, manage capital in a manner so as to ensure that sufficient funds for capital investment and working capital are available, and ensure that the requirements of the Group’s debt covenants are met. The Group does not routinely make additional issues of capital, other than for the purpose of raising finance to fund significant acquisitions or developments intended to increase the overall value of the Group. Share plans were created to allow employees of the Group to participate in the ownership of the Group’s equity instruments, in order to ensure employees’ focus on growing the value of the Group to achieve the aims of all the shareholders.

The lease liability is initially measured as the present value of future lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, or if not available an incremental borrowing rate. Future lease payments will include fixed payments, variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate (initially measured at the rate at the commencement date) and amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees. The ROU asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the amount initially recognised as the lease liability, lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, initial direct costs incurred, and the estimated costs to be incurred at the end of the lease to restore the site to the required condition stipulated in the lease. On inception of a lease for a new site, where required, the estimated cost of decommissioning any additions is included within ROU assets and depreciated over the lease term. A corresponding provision is set up as disclosed in note 3.5. Depreciation (and any subsequent impairment) on the ROU asset, interest on the lease liability and any variable lease payments are all recognised in the income statement. Ongoing measurement The lease liability is adjusted for interest on the liability, adjustments to the lease payments and any reassessment of the lease as a result of a contract modification. After the commencement date the Group measures the ROU asset using a cost model, reducing the cost through depreciation and any impairment losses. Adjustments will be made to the ROU asset to reflect the changes in the lease liability as a result of changes to lease payments or modifications to the lease. Short term and low-value leases The Group has taken the recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value items.

The accounting policy for each type of financial instrument is included within the relevant note. Financial assets are initially measured at fair value, unless otherwise noted, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss. A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or the Company transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, plus, in the case of other financial liabilities, directly attributable transaction costs. Other financial liabilities, primarily the Company’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings, are measured at amortised cost. Financial liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss and are held on the statement of financial position at fair value. A financial liability is derecognised when the Company’s obligations are discharged, expire or are cancelled. Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance costs. An equity instrument is any contract that has a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities.

We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements affecting profit exceeding £715,000 (2017: £725,000) or otherwise exceeding £2,000,000 (2017: £2,000,000), in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. This also includes procedures on finance costs and assets established on consolidation; the total of these balances were audited at Group level. Full _scope audits for Group reporting purposes were performed at 33 components_ in the following countries: Australia, China (including Hong Kong), Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, Thailand, UK and USA. The components for which we performed specified risk-focused audit procedures or analysis at an aggregated _Group level were not individually significant but were included in the scope of_ our Group reporting work to provide further coverage. We select these components on a rotational basis, setting a financial threshold on each of the Group profit before tax, Group revenue and Group property, plant and equipment and using our assessment of risk to select a sample of sites from those that meet at least one of these thresholds. The components within the scope of our work accounted for the percentages illustrated opposite. The remaining 9% of total Group profit before tax, 17% of Group revenue and 16% of Group property, plant and equipment is represented by a large number of smaller reporting components, none of which individually represented more than 0.8% of any of the total profits or losses that made up Group profit before tax, total Group revenue or total Group property, plant and equipment. For these residual components, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these. The Group team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back. The Group team approved each component materiality, which ranged from £500,000 to £4,500,000, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components. The Group audit team carried out audits for Group reporting purposes of the financial information of components covering 19% (2017: 33%) of the total profits and losses that made up Group profit before tax, including the audit of the parent Company. The Group audit team also undertook all audit procedures of certain total Group account balances as mentioned above, covering a further 4% (2017: 4%) of total profits and losses that made up Group profit before tax.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements (‘the going concern period’). Our responsibility is to conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors’ conclusions and, had there been a material uncertainty related to going concern, to make reference to that in this audit report. However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of reference to a material uncertainty in this auditor’s report is not a guarantee that the Group and the Company will continue in operation. In our evaluation of the Directors’ conclusions, we considered the inherent risks to the Group’s and Company’s business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group’s and Company’s financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks that we considered most likely to adversely affect the Group’s and Company’s available financial resources over this period were: - ride safety incidents; - acts of terrorism and/or the impact of the threat of terrorism on consumer behaviours. As these were risks that could potentially cast significant doubt on the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, we considered sensitivities over the level of available financial resources indicated by the Group’s financial forecasts taking account of reasonably possible (but not unrealistic) adverse effects that could arise from these risks individually and collectively and evaluated the achievability of the actions the Directors consider they would take to improve the position should the risks materialise. We also considered less predictable but realistic second order impacts, such as the impact of Brexit and the erosion of customer or supplier confidence or a broad economic downturn, which could result in a rapid reduction of available financial resources. Based on this work, we are required to report to you if we have concluded that the use of the going concern basis of accounting is inappropriate or there is an undisclosed material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt over the use of that basis for a period of at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements.

Auditor’s responsibilities Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud, other irregularities (see below), or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud, other irregularities or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. A f ll d i i f ibili i i id d h FRC’ b i Irregularities – ability to detect We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our sector experience and through discussion with the Directors and other management (as required by auditing standards) and discussed with the Directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations. We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group to component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at Group level. The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably. Firstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits legislation and taxation legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items. Secondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation. We identified the following area as that most likely to have such an effect: health and safety, recognising the nature of the Group’s activities. Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the Directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. These limited procedures did not identify actual or suspected non-compliance. Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations (irregularities) is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it. In addition, as with any audit, there remains a higher risk of non-detection of irregularities arising from fraud, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

The accounting policy for each type of financial instrument is included within the relevant note. Financial assets are initially measured at fair value, unless otherwise noted, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss. A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or the Group transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, plus, in the case of other financial liabilities, directly attributable transaction costs. Other financial liabilities, primarily the Group’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings, are measured at amortised cost. Financial liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss and are held on the statement of financial position at fair value. A financial liability is derecognised when the Group’s obligations are discharged, expire or are cancelled. Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance costs. An equity instrument is any contract that has a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.

Judgements Management considers the following areas to be the judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. They are explained in more detail in the related notes: - Useful life of brands (note 3.2) – where brands have been recognised as part of an acquisition, they have been assessed as having indefinite useful lives and management have considered that this judgement remains appropriate. - Goodwill impairment reviews (note 3.3) – the level at which goodwill is initially allocated and thereafter monitored. Estimates Management considers the following area to involve a significant degree of estimation uncertainty: - Valuation of Resort Theme Parks Operating Group (RTP) assets and impairment (note 3.3) – estimation of discounted cash flows when calculating the value in use of assets. Other non-significant areas that include a degree of estimation uncertainty are: - Valuation of assets and impairment, excluding RTP (note 3.3) – estimation of discounted cash flows when calculating the value in use of assets. - Taxation (note 2.4) – recognition of deferred tax balances and accounting for tax risks. - Provisions (note 3.5) – estimated outflow to settle the obligation and, where relevant, the appropriate discount and inflation rates to apply. - Interest-bearing loans and borrowings (note 4.2) – expected period of borrowings when calculating the effective interest rate on those borrowings. - Share-based payment transactions (note 4.6) – estimation of future performance when estimating vesting rates on share schemes. - Investments (note 5.1) – expected period of and eventual return on investments when calculating the fair value. - Employee benefits (note 5.2) – assumed discount rate, inflation rate and mortality when valuing defined benefit liabilities.

From time to time, the Group also enters into service contracts for attraction development. Tickets, annual passes and other services can be bought in advance, generally online, in which case these advanced revenues are held in deferred revenue until the visitor uses those tickets or services. Visitor revenue is then recognised when the visitor enters the attraction. Revenue from the sale of annual passes is deferred and then recognised evenly over the period that the pass is valid. Retail and food and beverage sales revenues are recognised at the point of sale. Accommodation revenue is recognised at the time when a customer stays at Merlin accommodation.

187,Offerings 2020.md,591,1.1 BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED),591.8,,591.8.1,,"IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ IFRS 9 has been adopted by the Group in 2018. The new standard replaces IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement’ and sets out requirements for recognising and measuring financial assets and financial liabilities. The new requirements of the standard have been applied retrospectively, taking advantage of the exemption to not restate comparative information with respect to classification and measurement changes. The impact of IFRS 9 has not seen material changes to the financial statements for the Group. Further details of each aspect of the new standard have been provided below: _Classification and measurement_ IFRS 9 contains a new classification and measurement approach for financial assets that reflects the business model in which assets are managed and their cash flow characteristics. Under IFRS 9 the number of classification categories has reduced, resulting in all financial assets being measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss. Areas to note following the adoption of IFRS 9 are: - There has not been a change to the Group’s trade and other receivables balances as a result of the classification changes. - The election available under IFRS 9 has been taken, allowing minority equity investments to continue to be held at fair value with changes going through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). These equity investments were previously held as available-for-sale, with changes in fair value being recognised through equity. Under IFRS 9 all fair value gains and losses will be reported through OCI, no impairment losses will be recognised in profit or loss and any gains or losses realised on disposal of these investments will no longer be reclassified to profit or loss. - The classification for financial liabilities is largely similar under the new standard. The Group has not had to adjust any classifications for financial liabilities. _Impairment_ IFRS 9 replaces the ‘incurred loss’ model in IAS 39 with a forward looking ‘expected credit loss’ (ECL) model. This will apply to all financial assets measured at amortised cost or FVOCI, except equity investments, and will be measured in respect of default events that will occur in 12 months from the reporting date or over the lifetime of the financial asset, depending on certain criteria. A review of each category of financial assets has been performed to assess the level of credit risk and the appropriate ECL to use. The Group has assessed that this only applies to its accounting for trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents, as detailed below: - The Group has limited credit risk in respect of trade and other receivables with its customers as the majority pay in advance or at the time of their visit. The estimated ECLs are calculated using both actual credit loss experience and forward looking projections and do not result in material changes to the impairment of trade and other receivables. - Cash and cash equivalents are held with banks and financial institutions. The estimated ECLs are calculated based on the 12 month expected loss basis and reflect the short term nature of the exposures. The Group considers that its cash and cash equivalents have a low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties. Based on this, the ECL is not significant for cash and cash equivalents. At each reporting date the expected credit losses will be reviewed to reflect changes in credit risk and adjustments made accordingly. There has not been a material adjustment to trade and other receivables or cash as a result of the new methodology. _Hedging_ As allowed on initial application, the Group has chosen to apply its hedge accounting policy under IFRS 9 rather than continuing to apply IAS 39. The new standard introduces a more principles-based approach with the intention of aligning the accounting for hedging instruments more closely with the Group’s risk management strategies and to apply a more qualitative and forward looking approach to assessing hedge effectiveness. IFRS 9 also introduces new requirements on rebalancing hedge relationships and prohibiting voluntary discontinuation of hedge accounting. All of the Group’s existing hedge relationships that were previously designated as effective hedging relationships have continued to qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9 and are aligned to the Group’s risk management strategy and objective. The new standard is applied prospectively and therefore there are no adjustments on transition. Additional disclosures or amendments have been provided where required. ----- ##### N O T E S T O T H E A C C O U N T S ## SECTION 1 ##### C O N T I N U E D ## BASIS OF PREPARATION 52 weeks ended 29 December 2018 (2017: 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017) IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. It replaced IAS 18 ‘Revenue’, IAS 11 ‘Construction contracts’ and related interpretations. The Group has adopted IFRS 15 using the cumulative effect method (without practical expedients). This approach requires the effect of applying this standard to be recognised at the date of initial application (i.e. 31 December 2017). There is no impact to retained earnings on transition because the timing of recognition of each category of Merlin’s revenue under the transfer of risks and rewards principles in IAS 18 matches the timing under the control principles in IFRS 15. In line with adopting IFRS 15 using the cumulative effect method, the information presented for 2017 has not been restated. _Impact_ IFRS 15 requires Merlin to make an assessment, considering the control principles of IFRS 15, as to whether parties involved in providing goods or services to a customer are acting as a principal (if they control delivery to the customer) or, if they are arranging for those goods or services to be provided by the other party, as an agent. Under IAS 18 this assessment was made based on which entity had the exposure to the significant risks and rewards associated with the transaction. We have reviewed how this change affects situations where a third party is involved, together with Merlin, in providing visitors to Merlin attractions with admission tickets and/or accommodation, or commercial offerings such as photos and games services once inside a Merlin attraction. There is no difference in the pattern of revenue recognition arising from this change. - Trade partners – Merlin engages with trade partners (such as online travel agents) in selling admission tickets and accommodation to the visiting customer. In instances where this leads to trade partners being considered Merlin’s agent, Merlin records revenue at the amount paid by the visiting customer (‘gross’) and records the amount of underlying commission retained by the agent within cost of sales. - Commercial offerings – Merlin partners with third parties in the operation of commercial offerings within theme park resorts and Midway attractions. The most significant of these are photo and games operations where the Group has analysed which party is considered to control the relevant operation. The nature of the operations concerned, and the judgements made, impact each Operating Group in different ways. The following table summarises the impacts of adopting IFRS 15 on the Group’s consolidated income statement for the 52 weeks ended 29 December 2018 and each of the line items affected. There was no material impact on the Group’s statement of financial position, statement of cash flows or statement of comprehensive income: Amounts without adoption As reported Adjustment of IFRS 15 £m £m £m **2018** Revenue 1,688 (35) 1,653 Cost of sales (298) 35 (263) Gross profit 1,390 – 1,390 _Disaggregation of revenue_ The following categories of revenue (all excluding VAT and similar taxes) have been disaggregated: - Visitor revenue – which represents admissions tickets, retail, food and beverage sales and other commercial offerings such as photos and games experiences inside a Merlin attraction. Ticket revenue is recognised at point of entry. Revenue from annual passes and other tickets that entitle a customer to continued visits over a period of time is deferred and then recognised evenly over the period that the pass is valid. Retail and food and beverage revenue, along with other similar commercial offerings, is recognised at point of sale. - Accommodation revenue – which represents overnight stay and conference room revenue along with food and beverage revenue earned within our hotels and other accommodation offerings. Accommodation revenue is recognised at the time when a customer stays at Merlin accommodation. - Other revenue – which represents sponsorship, function, management and service contract revenue along with other sundry items. Sponsorship revenue is recognised over the relevant contract term. Function revenue is recognised at the time of the event. Management and service contract revenue is recognised in line with the performance obligations in the specific contract. Information regarding the Group’s results including this disaggregation of revenue by nature as required by IFRS 15 is included in note 2.1. ----- ## SECTION 2 RESULTS FOR THE YEAR 52 weeks ended 29 December 2018 (2017: 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017)",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

Deferred tax is provided on certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and taxation purposes respectively. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period. After considering forecast future profits, deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those assets can be utilised.

The difference between the reported ETR of 19.2% and the UK standard tax rate of 19.0% is largely attributable to the Group’s geographic mix of profits and reflects higher rates in certain jurisdictions, particularly the USA. In addition, the reported rate is increased by non-deductible expenses which primarily arise as a result of depreciation on capital expenditure from continued investment in our attractions. These factors are offset by the Group’s internal financing arrangements, which have been put in place to support development and ongoing funding needs in overseas territories. The Group’s ETR has fallen from 22.9% to 19.0% (based on underlying results). This is primarily driven by the ongoing impact of a package of measures enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (USA tax reform) in the USA on 22 December 2017. In particular, the reduction in the US federal tax rate, effective in the 2018 period, has driven a significant reduction in the effect of tax rates in foreign jurisdictions (2018: 5.2%; 2017: 8.2%).

Where components of an item of PPE have different useful lives, they are accounted for separately. The initial cost of PPE includes all costs incurred in bringing the asset into use and includes external costs for the acquisition, construction and commissioning of the asset, internal project costs (primarily staff expenses) and capitalised borrowing costs. Assets acquired through business combinations At the time of a business combination PPE is separately recognised and valued. Given the specialised nature of the PPE acquired, fair values are calculated on a depreciated replacement cost basis. The key estimates are the replacement cost, where industry specific indices are used to restate original historic cost; and depreciation, where the total and remaining economic useful lives are considered, together with the residual value of each asset. The total estimated lives applied are consistent with those set out below. Residual values are based on industry specific indices. New sites Capital expenditure on new attractions includes all the costs of bringing the items of PPE within that attraction into use ready for the opening of the attraction. Pre-opening costs are only capitalised to the extent they are required to bring PPE into its working condition. Other pre-opening costs are expensed as incurred. On inception of a lease for a new site, where required, the estimated cost of decommissioning any additions is included within PPE and depreciated over the lease term. A corresponding provision is set up as disclosed in note 3.5. Existing sites Subsequent expenditure on items of PPE in our existing estate can be broadly split into two categories: - Capital expenditure which adds new items of PPE to an attraction or which extends the operational life, or enhances existing items, of PPE is accounted for as an addition to PPE. Examples of such expenditure include new rides or displays and enhancements to rides or displays, which increase the appeal of our attractions to visitors. - Expenditure which is incurred to maintain the items of PPE in a safe and useable state and to maintain the useful life of items of PPE is charged to the income statement as incurred. Examples of such expenditure include regular servicing and maintenance of buildings, rides and displays and ongoing repairs to items of PPE. Depreciation Land is not depreciated. Assets under construction are not depreciated until they come into use, when they are transferred to buildings or plant and equipment as appropriate. Depreciation is then charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of PPE. Asset lives for plant and equipment vary depending on the nature of the asset, from short life assets such as IT assets, up to long term infrastructure assets.

Significant factors impacting the Group’s future ETR include the USA tax reform, the ability to continue current financing arrangements and changes to local or international tax laws. With regard to the latter, the European Commission’s preliminary finding relating to the UK’s Controlled Foreign Company rules is further detailed in note 5.4. The Finance Act 2016, which provided for reductions in the main rate of UK corporation tax from 20% to 19% effective from 1 April 2017 and to 17% effective from 1 April 2020, was substantively enacted on 19 September 2016. Otherwise, the Group’s future ETR will primarily be affected by the geographic mix of profits.

The Group uses EBITDA less an allocation of central costs, in line with other recharges which occur in the business, as a proxy for the operating cash flows of its attractions as they are not significantly impacted by movements in working capital. Growth in EBITDA EBITDA is forecast by an analysis of both projected revenues and costs. Visitor numbers and revenue projections are based on market analysis, including the total available market, historic trends, competition and site development activity, both in terms of capital expenditure on rides and attractions as well as marketing activity. Projections of operating costs are based on historical data, adjusted for variations in visitor numbers and planned expansion of site activities as well as general market conditions. Timing and quantum of future capital and maintenance expenditure Projections are based on the attractions’ long term development plans, taking into account the capital investment necessary to maintain and sustain the performance of the attractions’ assets. Long term growth rate A growth rate of 2.5% (2017: 2.5%) was determined based on management’s long term expectations, taking account of historical averages and future expected trends in both market development and market share growth. Discount rates to reflect the risks involved Based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital of a ‘market participant’ within the main geographical regions where the Group operates, these are drawn from market data and businesses in similar sectors, and adjusted for asset specific risks.

Sensitivity analysis has therefore been performed on the calculated recoverable amounts considering incremental changes in the key assumptions. Particular focus is given to material amounts where headroom is more limited. As in prior years, this solely relates to goodwill attributed to the Resort Theme Parks Operating Group (RTP) where the headroom is £93 million (2017: £32 million). The Midway Attractions and LEGOLAND Parks Operating Groups, as well as individual brands, show considerable headroom and are not sensitive to even significant changes in any of the key assumptions. In undertaking sensitivity analysis for RTP, consideration has been given to movements in forecast EBITDA, increases in discount rates and reductions in long term growth rates. At the year end the Directors consider that the forecasts used reflect the current best estimate of future trading in RTP. It is noted, however, that the calculations are inherently sensitive to the level of growth within RTP, which may be affected by factors such as weather patterns and the wider economic trading environment. While in the short term slower growth would be highly unlikely to affect valuations by a substantial amount, longer term shortfalls that affect the outlook for the fourth year of the plan (which drives the terminal value) would have a more significant impact. If EBITDA for RTP as a whole was forecast to be 9% (2017: 3%) lower than currently anticipated for 2023 (2017: than anticipated for 2022), headroom would be absorbed in full. Discount rates have been derived from market data. As these rates are intended to be long term in nature they are expected to be reasonably stable in the short term, however market discount rates could increase in future. If the discount rate used across RTP had been higher by a factor of 8% to 10.6% (2017: 3% to 10.5%), headroom would have been absorbed in full. The long term growth rate, which is applied to the cash flows of the final year in the business plan, was determined based on management’s long term expectations, taking account of historical averages and future expected trends in both market development and market share growth.

The Group has a policy of actively managing its interest rate risk exposure using a combination of fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps. At 29 December 2018 the Group had €700 million and $400 million of fixed rate debt (2017: €700 million). Interest rate swaps are used to maintain a balance between fixed and floating rate debt. In aggregate 77% (2017: 79%) of the year end interest-bearing loans and borrowings is at a fixed rate for a weighted average period of 4.6 years (2017: 3.4 years). To achieve the desired balance of fixed and floating interest rates across currencies, the Group uses both floating to fixed interest rate swaps (which are part of cash flow hedging relationships) and fixed to floating interest rate swaps (which are part of fair value hedging relationships). Interest rate swaps are recognised at fair value which is determined by reference to market rates. The fair value is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to exit the swap, taking into account current interest rates, credit risks and bid/ask spreads. Following initial recognition, changes in fair value are recognised immediately in profit or loss, except where the Group adopts hedge accounting. When hedge accounting, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items. It makes an assessment, at inception and on an ongoing basis, as to whether the hedging instruments are expected to be ‘highly effective’ in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the respective hedged items during the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity. Any ineffective portion of changes in fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Cumulative gains and losses would remain in equity until either the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, or until the hedged transaction occurs, at which point they will be reclassified to profit or loss. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the fair value adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised to profit and loss from that date. At 29 December 2018 the Group had €40 million (2017: €40 million) of fair value interest rates swaps with a value of less than £1 million (2017: less than £1 million), and $120 million _(2017: $nil) of fair value interest rates swaps with a value of £2 million (2017: £nil). A 100 basis points fall in the interest rates with a similar duration as the swaps_ would lead to an increase in value of £8 million (2017: £1 million) and a 100 basis points rise in the interest rates with a similar duration as the swaps would lead to a decrease in value of £7 million (2017: £1 million). All interest rate swaps held by the Group are hedge accounted. Sensitivity analysis Based on the net debt position as at 29 December 2018, taking into account interest rate swaps, each 100 basis points fall or rise in market interest rates would result in an increase or decrease in net interest paid of £2 million (2017: less than £1 million).

The Group’s potential currency exposures comprise transaction and translation exposures. The Group ensures that its net exposure to foreign currency balances is kept to a minimal level by using foreign currency swaps to exchange balances back into Sterling or by buying and selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts is the present value of future cash flows and is determined by reference to market rates.

Finance lease payments Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Operating lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

The leases are accounted for as finance or operating leases depending on the specific circumstances of each lease and the nature of the attraction. For certain of the sites an individual lease agreement is split for accounting purposes as a combination of finance and operating leases, reflecting the varied nature of assets at the attraction. Each of these sale and leaseback agreements runs for a period of 35 years from inception and allows for annual rent increases based on the inflationary index in the United Kingdom and fixed increases in Continental Europe. The Group has the option, but is not contractually required, to extend each of the lease agreements individually for two further terms of 35 years, subject to an adjustment to market rates at that time. LEGOLAND Japan was opened during 2017. The park was developed under the Group’s ‘operated and leased’ model whereby the Group’s local operating company leases the site and park infrastructure from a development partner. The development partners are related parties, being KIRKBI Invest A/S and LLJ Investco K.K, a subsidiary of KIRKBI A/S; with KIRKBI A/S being a shareholder of the Group and a related party (note 5.3). The lease is for a period of 50 years and is accounted for partly as a finance lease and partly as an operating lease depending on the nature of the underlying assets concerned. Land and longer life assets, for example core elements of the park’s infrastructure, are accounted for as operating leases. Finance lease assets are those elements that will be substantially or entirely consumed over the lease term. This accounting judgement was underpinned by a review of the cost of construction by asset type together with estimates of the lives of the assets concerned. The Group also enters into operating leases for sites within the Midway Attractions Operating Group and central areas. These are typically of a duration between 10 and 60 years, with rent increases determined based on local market practice. In addition to a fixed rental element, rents within the Midway Attractions Operating Group can also contain a performance related element, typically based on turnover at the site concerned. Options to renew leases exist at these sites in line with local market practice in the territories concerned. The key contractual terms in relation to each lease are considered when calculating the rental charge over the lease term. The potential impact on rent charges of future performance or increases based on inflationary indices are each excluded from these calculations.

IFRS 16 replaces existing leases guidance, including IAS 17 ‘Leases’, IFRIC 4 ‘Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease’, SIC-15 ‘Operating leases – incentives’ and SIC-27 ‘Evaluating the substance of transactions involving the legal form of a lease’. Under IFRS 16 the Group, as the lessee, will recognise an asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset, and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. The Group will elect to take recognition exemptions for short term leases and leases of low-value items. Leases that fall within the Group’s defined parameters for these exemptions will be excluded from the IFRS 16 lease accounting requirements and be expensed on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. ----- ##### N O T E S T O T H E A C C O U N T S ## SECTION 5 ##### C O N T I N U E D ## OTHER NOTES 52 weeks ended 29 December 2018 (2017: 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017) IFRS 16 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognises a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. There are recognition exemptions for short term leases and leases of low value items. The Group has completed an initial assessment of the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements and is in the process of refining this assessment. The actual impact of applying IFRS 16 on the financial statements in the period of initial application will depend on the composition of the Group’s lease portfolio at that date, any significant events or significant changes in circumstances that affect whether it is reasonably certain to exercise options and the extent to which the Group chooses to use recognition exemptions. The Group has considered its entire lease portfolio and substantially it all relates to land, buildings and infrastructure assets. As such, the most significant impact identified is that the Group will recognise new assets and liabilities for these leases. As at 30 December 2017, the Group’s future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases amounted to £1,897 million on an undiscounted basis (see note 4.4). The Group’s future minimum lease payments under finance leases amounted to £435 million on an undiscounted basis. In addition, the nature of expenses will now change as IFRS 16 replaces the straight-line operating lease expense with a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets and interest expense on lease liabilities. The Group’s rental expenses linked to turnover, which totalled £18 million during 2017, will continue to be recorded as a rent charge within operating expenses. The effect of this will be an increase in reported EBITDA. Due to the Group’s most significant leases being in their earlier stages, the ‘front loading’ impact of the finance costs will result in an initial reduction in reported earnings albeit this would be expected to even out over the lease term. The Group’s leverage threshold loan covenants described in note 4.2 are under ‘frozen-GAAP’ and as such the adoption of IFRS 16 is not expected to impact the ability to comply with them.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

187,Offerings 2020.md,604,5.5 NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS (CONTINUED),604.2,,604.2.1,,"The Group has considered its entire lease portfolio which substantially relates to land, buildings and infrastructure assets, as follows: - For leases previously classified as operating leases, the Group will recognise a new asset in the form of a right-of-use (ROU) asset, together with an associated lease liability. The income statement will then reflect a depreciation charge for the ROU asset and an interest expense on the lease liability. This will replace the previous accounting for operating leases that were expensed within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. - Existing finance leases have also been reviewed against the new standard. As a result a number of leases entered into under historic sale and leaseback transactions have been re-assessed due to differences in the accounting treatment between IAS 17 and IFRS 16 of unguaranteed residual values. This has required re-assessment of the values of leased assets at inception and their treatment under IFRS 16 in subsequent periods. Regarding classification, these assets were accounted for as PPE under IAS 17 but are treated as ROU assets under IFRS 16. Judgements and estimates IFRS 16 requires certain judgements and estimates to be made. The most significant of these relate to the following: - The discount rate used in the calculation of the lease liability, which involves estimation. Discount rates are calculated on a lease by lease basis. For the property leases that make up substantially all of the Group’s lease portfolio this results in two approaches. For a small volume of high value leases, the rate implicit in the lease can be calculated and is therefore adopted. Otherwise, for the majority of leases the rate used is based on estimates of incremental borrowing costs. These will depend on the territory of the relevant lease and hence the currency used; the date of lease inception; and the lease term. As a result, reflecting the breadth of the Group’s lease portfolio; the transition approach adopted which has required estimation of historic discount rates; and estimations as to lease lives, there are a large number of discount rates within a wide range. - IFRS 16 defines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease together with the options to extend or terminate a lease, if the lessee were reasonably certain to exercise that option. Where a lease includes the option for the Group to extend the lease term, the Group makes a judgement as to whether it is reasonably certain that the option will be taken. This will take into account the length of time remaining before the option is exercisable; current trading; future trading forecasts as to the ongoing profitability of the attraction; and the level and type of planned future capital investment. This judgement will require review at each reporting period. A small number of large leases held by the Group came into effect as part of a sale and leaseback transaction that occurred in 2007. These leases have an initial lease period of 35 years, with an option to extend for two further periods of 35 years, subject to an adjustment to market rates at that time. As the Group is currently less than 12 years into this period its assessment is that at this point, it is not reasonably certain that these leases will be renewed, taking into account the factors noted above. This judgement will be reassessed at each reporting period. A reassessment of the remaining life of the lease could result in a recalculation of the lease liability and a material adjustment to the associated balances. Impact assessment As at 29 December 2018, the Group’s future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases amounted to £1,852 million (2017: £1,897 million) on an undiscounted basis (see note 4.4). Of these commitments an insignificant value relates to short term and low value leases which will continue to be recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense within the income statement. For leases within the scope of IFRS 16 the nature of expenses will change from a straight-line operating lease expense to a depreciation charge and an interest expense. Under existing accounting standards, during 2018 £107 million was recognised as an expense in respect of operating leases. Where the Group’s rental expense is linked to turnover or other performance criteria, or relates to short term and low value leases, these elements will continue to be recorded as rent within operating expenses. Based on 2018 results the impact on EBITDA of adopting IFRS 16 would therefore have been an increase of approximately £85 million. Due to the Group’s most significant leases being in their earlier stages, the ‘front loading’ impact of the finance costs results in an initial reduction in reported earnings. There would therefore have been a decrease in reported profit before tax of approximately £15 million. As at 30 December 2018, the Group expects to recognise ROU assets of approximately £1,020 million, including ROU assets in respect of existing finance leases and asset retirement provisions on leased properties, both previously classified under property, plant and equipment. The Group expects to recognise total lease liabilities of approximately £1,200 million, including existing finance lease liabilities of £200 million. The impact of adopting IFRS 16 on net debt would therefore be approximately £1,000 million. A net accruals and prepayments adjustment will reduce liabilities by approximately £30 million, primarily resulting from the derecognition of balances in relation to IAS 17 lease accounting where leases were expensed to the income statement on a straight-line basis. An increase in deferred tax assets of approximately £30 million is also anticipated. Based on information currently available the adjustments will in aggregate result in a decrease in net assets of approximately £100 million. The numbers above are approximate as there has been a need to re-assess the accounting treatment for leases which contained elements of both operating leases and finance leases. This has involved reviewing the historic values of leased assets at inception and their treatment under IFRS 16 in subsequent periods on an asset by asset basis. We will refine these approximate numbers as we embed the processes for accounting under IFRS 16 into the business. The Group’s leverage threshold loan covenants are under ‘frozen-GAAP’ and as such the adoption of IFRS 16 is not expected to impact the ability to comply with them. Transition The Group plans to apply IFRS 16 initially on 30 December 2018, using the fully retrospective approach. Therefore, the cumulative effect of adopting IFRS 16 will be recognised, in line with IAS 8 ‘Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors’, by restating the 52 week period ending 29 December 2018 and making an opening equity adjustment as at 31 December 2017.

Tax is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to items recognised directly in equity, when it is recognised directly in equity, or when it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income, when it is recognised through the statement of comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods. Deferred tax is provided on certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and taxation purposes respectively. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.

The fair value is measured at grant date and charged as the employees become unconditionally entitled to the rights.

The fair value of the share plans is recognised as an expense over the expected vesting period net of deferred tax with a corresponding entry to retained earnings. The fair value of the share plans is determined at the date of grant. Non-market based vesting conditions (i.e. earnings per share and return on capital employed targets) are taken into account in estimating the number of awards likely to vest. The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each accounting date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual awards issued. No adjustment is made after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or are not exercised.

The accounting policy for each type of financial instrument is included within the relevant note. Financial assets are initially measured at fair value, unless otherwise noted, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss. A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or the Company transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, plus, in the case of other financial liabilities, directly attributable transaction costs. Other financial liabilities, primarily the Company’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings, are measured at amortised cost. Financial liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss and are held on the statement of financial position at fair value. A financial liability is derecognised when the Company’s obligations are discharged, expire or are cancelled. Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance costs. An equity instrument is any contract that has a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.

The Resort Theme Parks (RTP) Operating Group is capital intensive and unlike the other Operating Groups has not generated headroom via growth from new site openings. As RTP has been impaired in the past and has a small amount of headroom there is a risk that its goodwill will not be supportable by its continuing operations. The estimated recoverable amount is subjective due to the inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting future cash flows and determining the most appropriate rate to discount them. In particular, the recovery rate of the UK theme parks, especially Alton Towers, following the accident on ‘The Smiler’ ride in 2015, is a materially sensitive assumption supporting the RTP goodwill valuation. ----- # INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S ### (CONTINUED) # REPORT",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

Materiality for the parent Company financial statements was set at £4,500,000 (2016: £4,500,000) by reference to component materiality. This is lower than the materiality we would otherwise have determined by reference to total assets, and represents 0.1% of the parent Company’s total assets (2016: 0.1%). We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements affecting profit exceeding £700,000 (2016: _£700,000) or otherwise exceeding £2,000,000 (2016: £2,000,000), in_ addition to other audit misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. The scope of our work included the audit of 82% (2016: 79%) of the total profits and losses that made up Group profit before tax, 75% (2016: 74%) of total Group revenue and 75% (2016: 70%) of total Group property, plant and equipment. This included the audit, for Group reporting purposes, of the financial information of certain components. It also included procedures on finance costs and assets established on consolidation; the total of these balances were audited at Group level. Audits for Group reporting purposes, including those performed by the Group audit team, were performed at components in the following countries: Australia, China (including Hong Kong), Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK and USA. The components for which we performed work other than audits for Group reporting purposes were not individually significant but were included in the scope of our Group reporting work and provided further coverage over the Group’s results of 7% (2016: 8%) of total profits or losses that made up Group profit before tax. We select these components on a rotational basis, setting a financial threshold on each of the Group profit before tax, Group revenue and Group property, plant and equipment and using our assessment of risk to select a sample of sites from those that meet at least one of these thresholds. The remaining 11% (2016: 13%) of total profits and losses that made up Group profit before tax, 14% (2016: 14%) of total Group revenue and 16% (2016: 16%) of total Group property, plant and equipment were represented by a large number of smaller reporting components. None of these components individually represent more than 1.2% (2016: 1.8%) of any of the total profits or losses that made up Group profit before tax, total Group revenue or total Group property, plant and equipment.

In the judgement of the Directors this presentation shows the underlying performance of the Group more accurately. There were no exceptional items in 2017 or 2016. #### 2.3 FINANCE INCOME AND COSTS Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares. The following reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations: Provisions are recognised when the Group has legal or constructive obligations as a result of past events and it is probable that expenditure will be required to settle those obligations. They are measured at the Directors’ best estimates, after taking account of information available and different possible outcomes. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less attributable fees. These fees are then amortised through the income statement on an effective interest rate basis over the expected life of the loan (or over the contractual term where there is no clear indication that a shorter life is appropriate). If the Group’s estimate of the expected life based on repayment subsequently changes, the resulting adjustment to the effective interest rate calculation is recognised as a gain or loss on re-measurement and presented separately in the income statement, in accordance with IAS 39. The fair value of the share plans is recognised as an expense over the expected vesting period with a corresponding entry to retained earnings, net of deferred tax. The fair value of the share plans is determined at the date of grant. Non-market based vesting conditions (i.e. earnings per share and return on capital employed targets) are taken into account in estimating the number of awards likely to vest, which is reviewed at each accounting date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual awards issued. No adjustment is made after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or are not exercised. The Group operates cash-settled versions of the employee incentive plans for employees in certain territories. The issues and resulting charges of these plans are not material to the financial statements. The Group holds investments in two forms. Minority equity investments are accounted for as ‘available for sale’ financial assets at fair value. They are not consolidated. As no observable market data is available for these minority equity holdings, fair value is determined by reference to discounted future cash flows, with movements recorded in other comprehensive income. No fair value movements have been recorded and there is no material sensitivity to the assumptions used. Previously, investments in loan notes were accounted for as financial assets at historic cost with interest accrued on an effective interest rate basis. This calculation required estimation of the expected period over which the investment will be held together with the value of the investment at the end of that period. Interest was recognised within finance income (see note 2.3). During 2017, these notes were modified such that they were derecognised and a minority equity investment recognised in their place. Associates and joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control or significant influence, established by contractual agreement. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the total recognised income and expenses on an equity accounted basis, from the date that joint control or influence commences until the date that it ceases.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

The tax charge comprises both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods. Deferred tax is provided on certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and taxation purposes respectively. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period. After considering forecast future profits, deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those assets can be utilised. This assessment is made after considering a number of factors, including the Group’s future trading expectations. A current tax provision is recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation. Tax provisions are based on management’s estimate of the amount of tax payable and the likelihood of settlement in relation to matters which have yet to be concluded. These include matters arising from ongoing audits, as well as other uncertain positions. A combination of in-house tax experts, previous experience and professional firms is used when assessing tax risks. Current provisions represent a number of different matters arising across the various jurisdictions in which the Group operates. It is currently unclear when these matters will be settled, but certain matters have been open for several years and may not be resolved in the coming year. Property, plant and equipment (PPE) are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Where components of an item of PPE have different useful lives, they are accounted for separately. The initial cost of PPE includes all costs incurred in bringing the asset into use and includes external costs for the acquisition, construction and commissioning of the asset, internal project costs (primarily staff expenses) and capitalised borrowing costs. Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of an acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired less any contingent liabilities assumed. Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. In respect of joint ventures, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the joint venture. Where they arise on acquisition, brands have been valued based on discounted future cash flows using the relief from royalty method, including amounts into perpetuity. Currently all such brands held are assessed as having indefinite useful economic lives. This assessment is based upon the strong historical performance of the brands over a number of economic cycles, the ability to roll out our brands, and the Directors’ intentions regarding the future use of brands. The Directors feel this is a suitable policy for a brands business which invests in and maintains the brands, and foresee no technological developments or competitor actions which would put a finite life on the brands. The brands are tested annually for impairment. Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred. Other intangible assets comprise software licences, sponsorship rights and other contract based intangible assets. They are amortised on a straight-line basis from the date they are available for use. They are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The estimated useful lives of other intangible assets are as follows: The carrying amounts of the Group’s goodwill, intangible assets and PPE are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists or if the asset has an indefinite life, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. The process of impairment testing is to estimate the recoverable amount of the assets concerned, and recognise an impairment loss whenever the carrying amount of those assets exceeds the recoverable amount. The level at which the assets concerned are reviewed varies as follows: Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance leases. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Where land and buildings are held under finance leases the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

The difference between the reported ETR of 22.9% and the UK standard tax rate of 19.3% is largely attributable to the Group’s geographic mix of profits and reflects higher rates in certain jurisdictions, particularly the USA, in relation to the current and prior year. In addition, the reported rate is increased by non-deductible expenses which primarily arise as a result of depreciation on capital expenditure from continued investment in our attractions. These factors are offset by the Group’s internal financing arrangements, which have been put in place to support development and ongoing funding needs in overseas territories, and the impact of the package of measures enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (USA tax reform) in the USA on 22 December 2017. The Group’s ETR has fallen from 23.8% to 22.9%. This is driven by the USA tax reform. The net £7 million (2.4%) reduction in current year ETR comprises: (i) the effect of changes in tax rates (£25 million) as deferred tax liabilities have been revalued due to the federal tax rate reducing from 35% to 21% effective 1 January 2018; offset by (ii) an increase in unrecognised temporary differences (£9 million) resulting from new restrictions on interest deductibility; and (iii) other tax charges and deductions (£9 million) originating from revisions to the USA taxation of foreign investments. Significant factors impacting on the Group’s future ETR include the USA tax reform, the ability to continue current financing arrangements and changes to local or international tax laws. With regard to the latter, the European Commission’s preliminary findings relating to the UK’s Controlled Foreign Company rules are further detailed in note 5.4.

To assess value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate. The Group uses a multiple of EBITDA to estimate fair value which is based on the Group’s average market capitalisation as a multiple of the Group’s underlying EBITDA. Where recoverable amount was based upon value in use, testing was performed by reference to the forward looking consolidated guidance communicated externally in October 2017, as well as subsequent scenario planning. This guidance was based on the Group’s internally approved five year business plan, being the current year and four future years, adjusted to reflect the potential for a continuation in the near term of the unforeseeable and uncontrollable events experienced in 2017, such as global terrorism continuing to impact our largest locations and extreme weather during peak trading periods. Whilst it is possible that similar events may occur in the future, these events are such that their nature, timing and extent cannot be precisely forecast, nor can management reliably estimate which site or Operating Group they may affect. In preparing the impairment calculations for the Resort Theme Parks Operating Group (RTP), where headroom is most limited, management have therefore reviewed the growth expectations for each of the parks, forming their best estimate based on a balanced assessment of what risks might crystallise for each site in the short to medium term; key to this was the pace of recovery of RTP in the UK, the potential for disruptive terrorist activities and historical weather patterns in Southern Europe. Reference was also made to current trading information, such as sales of annual passes and pre-booked accommodation. On the basis of these forecasts no impairment has been indicated. Common assumptions have been adopted for the purpose of testing goodwill across the business and for testing brand values where their risk profiles are similar.

The Group uses EBITDA less an allocation of central costs, in line with other recharges which occur in the business, as a proxy for the operating cash flows of its attractions as they are not significantly impacted by movements in working capital. Growth in EBITDA EBITDA is forecast by an analysis of both projected revenues and costs. Visitor numbers and revenue projections are based on market analysis, including the total available market, historic trends, competition and site development activity, both in terms of capital expenditure on rides and attractions as well as marketing activity. Operating costs projections are based on historical data, adjusted for variations in visitor numbers and planned expansion of site activities as well as general market conditions. Timing and quantum of future capital and Projections are based on the attractions’ long term development plans, taking into account the capital investment necessary to maintain maintenance expenditure and sustain the performance of the attractions’ assets.

The Midway Attractions and LEGOLAND Parks Operating Groups, as well as individual brands, show considerable headroom and are not sensitive to even significant changes in any of the key assumptions. In undertaking sensitivity analysis for RTP, consideration has been given to movements in forecast EBITDA, increases in discount rates and reductions in long term growth rates. At the year end the Directors consider that the forecasts used reflect the current best estimate of future trading in RTP. It is noted, however, that the calculations are inherently sensitive to the pace of the recovery at Alton Towers, weather patterns and the wider economic trading environment. While in the short term a slower recovery would be highly unlikely to affect valuations by a substantial amount, longer term shortfalls that affect the outlook for the fourth year of the plan (which drives the terminal value) would have a more significant impact. If EBITDA for RTP as a whole was forecast to be 3% (2016: 3%) lower than currently anticipated for 2022 (2016: that anticipated for 2021), headroom would be absorbed in full. Furthermore, the Directors considered a scenario with the continued manifestation of the risks described in the October 2017 strategic update, being headwinds from global terrorism, extreme weather and a slower pace of recovery at Alton Towers. Management’s view is that were the negative impacts suffered in 2017 to continue, aligned with its core discipline around prudent capital allocation and consistent with other attractions in the estate with a slower rate of growth, capital investment would be further tempered to reflect the reduction in incremental returns which could be generated. In this scenario the headroom would be reduced from £32 million to £11 million. While it is not impossible for either shortfall to occur, the Directors do not consider it to be probable based on the strength of the product development, diversity across the businesses in RTP and our proven track record in scaling our cost base and capital plan to respond to changing demand. Discount rates have been derived from market data. As these rates are intended to be long term in nature, they are expected to be reasonably stable in the short term, however market discount rates could increase in the future. If the discount rate used across RTP had been higher by a factor of 3% to 10.5% (2016: 3% to 11.3%), headroom would have been absorbed in full. The Directors have formed their best estimate of the discount rate and do not consider that such a move in the rate is appropriate, but it is not impossible that a different view of discount rates could be required in the future. The long term growth rate, which is applied to the cash flows of the final year in the business plan, was determined based on management’s long term expectations, taking account of historical averages and future expected trends in both market development and market share growth. The Directors do not consider it probable that this rate will prove to be inappropriate in the future, but note that if circumstances caused the rate to lower to 2.1% (2016: _2.1%), headroom would be absorbed in full._ #### 3.4 WORKING CAPITAL Based on the net debt position as at 30 December 2017, taking into account interest rate swaps, each 100 basis points fall or rise in market interest rates would result in an increase or decrease in net interest paid of less than £1 million (2016: £1 million).

The Group has a policy of actively managing its interest rate risk exposure using a combination of fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps. At 30 December 2017 the Group had €700 million of fixed rate debt (2016: €500 million). Taken together with the floating rate bank facilities and interest rate swaps (the accounting for which is set out below), in aggregate 79% (2016: 74%) of the year end interest-bearing loans and borrowings is at a fixed rate for a weighted average period of 3.4 years (2016: 4.2 years). Interest rate swaps are recognised at fair value which is determined by reference to market rates. The fair value is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to exit the swap, taking into account current interest rates, credit risks and bid/ask spreads. Following initial recognition, changes in fair value are recognised immediately in profit or loss, except where the Group adopts hedge accounting. When hedge accounting, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items. It makes an assessment, at inception and on an ongoing basis, as to whether the hedging instruments are expected to be ‘highly effective’ in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the respective hedged items during the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity. Any ineffective portion of changes in fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Cumulative gains and losses remain in equity until either the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, or until the hedged transaction occurs, at which point they will be reclassified to profit or loss. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the fair value adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised to profit and loss from that date. At 30 December 2017 the Group had €40 million of fair value interest rates swaps with a value of less than £1 million; a 100 basis points fall or rise in the Euro interest rate with a similar duration as the swap would lead to a change in value of £1 million.

The Group’s potential currency exposures comprise transaction and translation exposures. The Group ensures that its net exposure to foreign currency balances is kept to a minimal level by using foreign currency swaps to exchange balances back into Sterling or by buying and selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts is the present value of future cash flows and is determined by reference to market rates.

The leases are accounted for as finance or operating leases depending on the specific circumstances of each lease and the nature of the attraction. For certain of the sites an individual lease agreement is split for accounting purposes as a combination of finance and operating leases, reflecting the varied nature of assets at the attraction. Each of these sale and leaseback agreements runs for a period of 35 years from inception and allows for annual rent increases based on the inflationary index in the United Kingdom and fixed increases in Continental Europe. The Group has the option, but is not contractually required, to extend each of the lease agreements individually for two further terms of 35 years, subject to an adjustment to market rates at that time. LEGOLAND Japan was opened during the year. The park was developed under the Group’s ‘operated and leased’ model whereby the Group’s local operating company leases the site and park infrastructure from a development partner. The development partners are related parties, being KIRKBI Invest A/S and LLJ Investco K.K, a subsidiary of KIRKBI A/S; with KIRKBI A/S being a shareholder of the Group and a related party (note 5.3). The lease is for a period of 50 years and is accounted for partly as a finance lease and partly as an operating lease depending on the nature of the underlying assets concerned. Land and longer life assets, for example core elements of the park’s infrastructure, are accounted for as operating leases. Finance lease assets are those elements that will be substantially or entirely consumed over the lease term. This accounting judgement is underpinned by a review of the cost of construction by asset type together with estimates of the lives of the assets concerned. The liability when the finance lease was entered into on the opening of the park in April 2017 was £111 million. The Group also enters into operating leases for sites within the Midway Attractions Operating Group and central areas. These are typically of a duration between 10 and 60 years, with rent increases determined based on local market practice. In addition to a fixed rental element, rents within the Midway Attractions Operating Group can also contain a performance related element, typically based on turnover at the site concerned. Options to renew leases exist at these sites in line with local market practice in the territories concerned. The key contractual terms in relation to each lease are considered when calculating the rental charge over the lease term. The potential impact on rent charges of future performance or increases based on inflationary indices are each excluded from these calculations.

To enable the Group to meet its objective, the Directors monitor returns on capital through constant review of earnings generated from the Group’s capital investment programme and through regular budgeting and planning processes, manage capital in a manner so as to ensure that sufficient funds for capital investment and working capital are available, and the requirements of the Group’s debt covenants are met. The Group does not routinely make additional issues of capital, other than for the purpose of raising finance to fund significant acquisitions or developments intended to increase the overall value of the Group. Share plans have been created to allow employees of the Group to participate in the ownership of the Group’s equity instruments, in order to ensure employees are focused on growing the value of the Group to achieve the aims of all the shareholders.

That benefit is discounted to determine its present value and offset by the fair value of any scheme assets. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. All actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the period they occur directly in equity through other comprehensive income. The principal scheme that the Group operates is a closed scheme for certain former UK employees of the Tussauds Group, which was acquired in 2007. The scheme entitles retired employees to receive an annual payment based on a percentage of final salary for each year of service that the employee provided. The pension schemes have not directly invested in any of the Group’s own financial instruments or in properties or other assets used by the Group. The most recent full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2015. As a result, the Group agreed to pay annual deficit reduction contributions of £455,500, increasing at 3% per annum until 2021, together with an additional one-off payment of £2,260,000 which was paid in 2017.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (Adopted IFRS) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Company continues to prepare its parent Company financial statements in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101). This section sets out the Group’s accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole. Where an accounting policy is specific to one note, the policy is described in the note to which it relates. The accounting policies have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements and have been applied consistently by all subsidiaries and joint ventures. The Group prepares its annual consolidated financial statements on a 52 or 53 week basis. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 (2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016). The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments and certain investments which are measured at their fair value. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling. All values are stated in £ million (£m) except where otherwise indicated. # SECTION I ### (CONTINUED) # BASIS OF PREPARATION 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 (2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016) #### 1.1 BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED) # SECTION 2 ###  (CONTINUED) # RESULTS FOR THE YEAR 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 (2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016) #### 2.1 PROFIT BEFORE TAX (CONTINUED) # SECTION 2 ###  (CONTINUED) # RESULTS FOR THE YEAR 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 (2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016) #### 2.4 TAXATION # SECTION 2 ###  (CONTINUED) # RESULTS FOR THE YEAR 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 (2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016) #### 2.4 TAXATION (CONTINUED) # SECTION 3 OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 (2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016) #### 3.1 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT # SECTION 3 OPERATING ASSETS ### (CONTINUED) # AND LIABILITIES 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 (2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016) #### 3.1 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (CONTINUED) Depreciation is calculated in line with the policy stated previously. During the year the Group reviews useful economic lives and tests PPE for impairment in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy, as referred to in note 3.3. As a result no material adjustments were made in either 2016 or 2017. The Group leases buildings and plant and equipment under finance lease agreements secured on those assets. Additions of leased assets in the period of £111 million are in respect of the LEGOLAND Japan finance lease entered into on the opening of the park in April 2017 (note 4.4). At 30 December 2017 the net carrying amount of leased buildings was £103 million (2016: £16 million) and the net carrying amount of leased plant and equipment was £38 million (2016: £29 million). Further details in respect of leases and lease obligations are provided in note 4.4. # SECTION 3 OPERATING ASSETS ### (CONTINUED) # AND LIABILITIES 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 (2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016) #### 3.2 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED) # SECTION 3 OPERATING ASSETS ### (CONTINUED) # AND LIABILITIES 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 (2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016) #### 3.3 IMPAIRMENT TESTING (CONTINUED) # SECTION 3 OPERATING ASSETS ### (CONTINUED) # AND LIABILITIES 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 (2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016) #### 3.5 PROVISIONS # SECTION 4 CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING ### (CONTINUED) 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 (2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016) #### 4.2 INTEREST-BEARING LOANS AND BORROWINGS (CONTINUED) During the year an additional €200 million of the Group’s March 2022 2.75% coupon notes were issued at 103.5% of their nominal value to yield 2.01% (£178 million). The proceeds were partly used to repay €50 million (£43 million) of the floating rate term debt due to mature in March 2020. The Group’s facilities at the year end are: - Bank facilities comprising £250 million and $540 million floating rate term debt to mature in March 2020. The relevant floating interest rates are LIBOR and the USD benchmark rate, which were 0.51% (2016: 0.37%) and 1.61% (2016: 0.99%) respectively at 30 December 2017. The margin on the bank facilities is dependent on the Group’s adjusted leverage ratio and at 30 December 2017 was 2.0% (2016: 2.0%). - A £300 million multi-currency revolving credit facility of which £nil had been drawn down at 30 December 2017 (2016: £nil). The margin on this facility is also dependent on the Group’s adjusted leverage ratio and at 30 December 2017 was at a margin of 1.75% (2016: 1.75%) over the same floating interest rates when drawn. - €700 million (2016: €500 million) notes with a coupon rate of 2.75% to mature in March 2022. The Group has estimated that a refinancing of the bank facilities and multi-currency revolving credit facility is likely within the next 18 months, which is earlier than that previously assumed for accounting purposes. As a result the Group has accelerated the amortisation of financing costs in respect of these facilities and the resulting adjustment has been recognised as a loss on re-measurement and presented in the income statement as a charge of £4 million (see note 2.3). The fees related to the fixed rate notes are being amortised to the maturity of the notes as the notes are currently expected to be held to their full term. The borrowings (including the revolving credit facility) and the €700 million notes are unsecured but guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The Group is required to comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants in the bank facilities, including a requirement to maintain certain ratios of EBITDA to both net finance costs and net debt. It is also required to comply with certain non-financial covenants in the €700 million notes. All covenant requirements were satisfied throughout the year. #### 4.3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT # SECTION 4 CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING ### (CONTINUED) 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 (2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016) #### 4.3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED) # SECTION 4 CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING ### (CONTINUED) 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 (2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016) #### 4.4 LEASE OBLIGATIONS # SECTION 4 CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING ### (CONTINUED) 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 (2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016) #### 4.5 EQUITY AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT # SECTION 4 CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING ### (CONTINUED) 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 (2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016) #### 4.6 SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED) # SECTION 5 OTHER NOTES 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 (2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016) #### 5.1 INVESTMENTS # SECTION 5 ### (CONTINUED) # OTHER NOTES 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 (2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016) #### 5.2 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONTINUED) # SECTION 5 ### (CONTINUED) # OTHER NOTES 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 (2016: 53 weeks ended 31 December 2016) #### 5.4 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES The European Commission (EC) published its preliminary decision in November 2017, finding that certain elements of the UK’s Controlled Foreign Company rules amount to unlawful State Aid. The impact of a negative decision could result in a significant increase in the Group’s future effective tax rate. A final decision from the EC is expected in late 2018 but is subject to possible appeal. #### 5.5 NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS The following standards and interpretations, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) or the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee, have been adopted by the Group with no significant impact on its consolidated financial statements: - IAS 7 ‘Statement of cash flows’ – disclosure initiative. - IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’ – recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses.

187,Offerings 2020.md,612,IFRS 9,612.1,Classification and measurement,612.1.1,,"IFRS 9 contains a new classification and measurement approach for financial assets that reflects the business model in which assets are managed and their cash flow characteristics. Under IFRS 9 the number of classification categories has reduced, resulting in all financial assets being measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss. - The Group does not believe that the new classification requirements will have a material impact on its accounting for trade and other receivables. - At 30 December 2017, the Group held equity investments classified as available-for-sale of £59 million. The election available under IFRS 9 will be taken, allowing the minority equity investments to continue to be held at fair value with changes going through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). All fair value gains and losses will be reported through OCI, no impairment losses will be recognised in profit or loss and any gains or losses realised on disposal of these investments will no longer be reclassified to profit or loss. IFRS 9 largely retains the existing requirements for classification of financial liabilities under IAS 39.

187,Offerings 2020.md,612,IFRS 9,612.2,Impairment,612.2.1,,"IFRS 9 replaces the ‘incurred loss’ model in IAS 39 with a forward looking ‘expected credit loss’ (ECL) model. This will apply to all financial assets measured at amortised cost or FVOCI, except equity investments, and will be measured in respect of default events that will occur in 12 months from the reporting date or over the lifetime of the financial asset, depending on certain criteria. A review of each category of financial assets has been performed to assess the level of credit risk and the appropriate ECL to use. The Group has assessed that this only applies to its accounting for trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents, as detailed below: - The Group has limited credit risk in respect of trade and other receivables with its customers as the majority pay in advance or at the time of their visit. The estimated ECLs were calculated using both actual credit loss experience and forward looking projections and do not anticipate material changes to the impairment of trade and other receivables. - Cash and cash equivalents are held with banks and financial institutions. The estimated ECLs were calculated based on the 12 month expected loss basis and reflect the short term nature of the exposures. The Group considers that its cash and cash equivalents have a low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties. Based on this, the Group has estimated that the ECL is not material for cash and cash equivalents. At each reporting date the expected credit losses will be reviewed to reflect changes in credit risk and adjustments made accordingly. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,604

The new standard introduces a more principles based approach with the intention of aligning the accounting for hedging instruments more closely with the Group’s risk management strategies and to apply a more qualitative and forward looking approach to assessing hedge effectiveness. IFRS 9 also introduces new requirements on rebalancing hedge relationships and prohibiting voluntary discontinuation of hedge accounting. The Group anticipates that all existing hedge relationships that are currently designated as effective hedging relationships will continue to qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9 and are aligned to the Group’s risk management strategy and objective. IFRS 9 includes additional disclosure requirements, particularly around hedge accounting, credit risk and ECLs.

The Group does not anticipate any material changes to the statement of financial position as a result of its adoption of IFRS 9 and the expected impact on the Group’s equity at the start of the 2018 financial year is not material.

For annual passes, revenue is recognised evenly over the validity period. Under IFRS 15 the timing of revenue recognition by the Group is expected to be unchanged, with a £nil estimated impact on retained earnings and non-controlling interest at the beginning of the 2018 financial year. The majority of Merlin’s revenue comes directly from the visiting customer, either in advance or at the time of the visit, and simply represents the amounts received from the visiting customer (excluding VAT and similar taxes). This is unaffected by IFRS 15. - Trade partners – Merlin engages with trade partners (such as online travel agents), in selling admission tickets and accommodation to the end customer. Under IFRS 15, the Group has reassessed these arrangements under the control model required by the new standard (in contrast to the risk and reward model under IAS 18). In some instances this leads to trade partners being considered agents for Merlin rather than customers themselves. This is expected to result in an increase to the value of revenue with a corresponding change to cost of sales (but no impact on EBITDA). - Commercial offerings – in a small number of contracts, Merlin engages with third parties to assist in the operation of commercial offerings within theme park resorts and Midway attractions. The Group currently determines who acts as the agent or principal on a case-by-case basis. Under IFRS 15, the Group has reassessed these arrangements under the control model required by the new standard (in contrast to the risk and reward model under IAS 18). In some cases, this leads to a different determination of who acts as the agent or principal. This is expected to result in a change to the value of revenue with a corresponding change to cost of sales (but no impact on EBITDA).
