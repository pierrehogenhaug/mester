**Important Notice for Investors in the United Kingdom. The Offering Memorandum has not been**
approved by an authorised person in the United Kingdom and is for distribution only to, and is only
directed at, persons who (i) have professional experience in matters relating to investments (being
investment professionals falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
(Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Financial Promotion Order”)), (ii) are persons
falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations etc.”) of
the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom or (iv) are persons to whom an
invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”)) in connection with the issue or sale of any
securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons

Offering Memorandum has been sent to you in electronic form. You are reminded that documents
transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission
and consequently none of the Initial Purchasers, any person who controls any Initial Purchaser, nor any
of their respective subsidiaries, nor any directors, officers, employees or agents of theirs, or affiliates of
the foregoing entities or persons, accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect of any


-----

difference between the Offering Memorandum distributed to you in electronic form and the hard copy
version available to you from the Initial Purchasers upon your request. Notwithstanding the United
Kingdom’s departure from the European Union, any references in this document to European Union
law should be treated as references to such law as applies in England and Wales from time to time
including as retained, amended, extended, re-enacted or otherwise given effect on or after 11:00 pm on
31 January 2020.

**Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market: Solely for the purposes of each**
manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the debt securities
described in the Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such
debt securities is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive
2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such debt securities to
eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering,
selling or recommending such debt securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the
Manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for
undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such debt securities (by either adopting or
refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors: The debt securities described in the Offering**
Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to and should
not be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European
Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of:
(i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the
meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II;
or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the “Prospectus Regulation”).
Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended,
the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the debt securities described in the
Offering Memorandum or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been
prepared and therefore offering, selling or distributing such debt securities or otherwise making them
available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. The Offering
Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of such debt securities in any member state
of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of such debt securities. The Offering Memorandum is not
a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**UK MiFIR Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market: Solely**
for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in
respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible
counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and
professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for
distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA
Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product
_Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the_
Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels.

**Prohibition of sales to UK retail investors: The securities described in the attached Offering**
Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to and should
not be made available to and should not be offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available to any
retail investor in the United Kingdom. For the purposes of this paragraph, a “retail investor” means a


-----

person who is one (or more) of: (i) a “retail client,” as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation
(EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal)
Act 2018 (as amended, the “EUWA”); (ii) a “customer” within the meaning of the provisions of the
FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution
Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a “professional client,” as defined in point (8) of
Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA (“UK MiFIR”); or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus
Regulation, and the expression an offer includes the communication in any form and by any means of
sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the debt securities to be offered so as to enable an
investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for such debt securities. Consequently, no key information
document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of
the EUWA (as amended, the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the debt
securities described in the Offering Memorandum or otherwise making them available to retail investors
in the United Kingdom has been prepared and, therefore, offering, selling or distributing the debt
securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom may be
unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the UK will
be made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law
by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from a requirement to publish a prospectus
for offers of Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus
Regulation.

amount of its senior secured notes due 2030 (the “Notes”). The proceeds of the Offering (as defined herein) will be used, together with cash on balance sheet: (i) to redeem the Issuer’s €500
million Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”), including paying the redemption premium thereon and accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the redemption (the “Refinancing”
and together with the Offering, the “Transactions”), (ii) maintain cash on balance sheet to repay, redeem, repurchase (including from the open-market) or address maturities of, our other secured
indebtedness, and (iii) to pay the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions.

mature on, 2030; provided that if any Existing Senior Notes (as defined below) remain outstanding on 15 August 2027, the Notes will mature on 15 August 2027.

We will be entitled at our option to redeem all or a portion of the Notes at any time prior to at a redemption price equal to 100 per cent. of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts (as defined herein), if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption, plus the applicable “make whole” premium as set forth in this
preliminary offering memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”). At any time prior to, up to 40 per cent. of the aggregate principal amount of Notes may be redeemed with the net

substantially concurrently). The Notes may be redeemed at any time on or after at the redemption prices set forth in this Offering Memorandum.

Upon the occurrence of certain defined events constituting a change of control, each holder of Notes may require the Issuer to repurchase all or a portion of its Notes at a price equal to per
cent. of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any. However, a change of control will not be deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated
net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event. In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may elect to redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes at
a price equal to per cent. of the principal amount thereof (including accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any). In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for
the Notes, if holders of not less than 90 per cent. in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or
any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right
to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of the Notes. See “Description of Notes—
_Optional Redemption.”_

guarantees, the “Subsidiary Guarantees” and together with the Parent Guarantee, the “Guarantees”).

that also secures the Existing 2026 Notes, the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations on a first priority basis and the Existing Senior Notes on a second priority basis. The validity and
enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and the liability of each Guarantor and security provider will be subject to certain limitations. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations
_and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security.” The security interests in favour of the Notes and the Guarantees may be released under certain circumstances._
The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of the Subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor that do not guarantee the Notes and effectively subordinated to any
obligations that are secured by property and assets that do not constitute Collateral for the Notes to the extent of the value of such property or assets.

**ALLOTMENT MUST BE CONDUCTED BY THE STABILISATION MANAGER (OR**

**IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT SELLING AND JURISDICTIONAL**

**RESTRICTIONS**

**United States**

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws
of any state of the United States, and may not be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant
to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act. For a description of certain other restrictions on resale and transfer, see “Plan of
_Distribution” and “Notice to Investors.”_

In the United States, the offering of the Notes (the “Offering”) is being made only to “qualified
institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act). Prospective purchasers
that are qualified institutional buyers are hereby notified that the Initial Purchasers of the Notes may be
relying on an exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act provided by Rule
144A. Outside the United States, the Offering of the Notes is being made to persons who are not U.S.
persons in offshore transactions (each as defined in Regulation S).

Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), any state securities commission
nor any non-U.S. securities authority has approved or disapproved of these securities or determined that
this Offering Memorandum is accurate or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal
offense.

**European Economic Area**

**_MiFID II Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market_**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment
in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for


-----

distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II
is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

**_PRIIPs Regulation / Prospectus Regulation / Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors_**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II;
or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key
information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling
the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under
the PRIIPs Regulation. This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of
Notes in any Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus
Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes. This Offering
Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**Denmark**

This Offering Memorandum has not been filed with or approved by the Danish Financial Supervisory
Authority (Finanstilsynet), the Danish Business Authority (Erhvervsstyrelsen) or any other regulatory
authority in Denmark. The Notes have not been offered or sold and may not be offered, sold or delivered
directly or indirectly in Denmark by way of a public offering, unless in compliance with the Prospectus
Regulations and the Danish Capital Markets Act (Lov om kapitalmarkeder), the Danish Financial
Business Act (Lov om finansiel virksomhed) and Executive Orders (bekendtgørelser) issued pursuant
thereto as amended from time to time.

**Germany**

The Offering of the Notes is not a public offering in the Federal Republic of Germany. The Notes may
only be offered, sold and acquired in accordance with the provisions of the Prospectus Regulation and
the Securities Prospectus Act of the Federal Republic of Germany (the “Securities Prospectus Act,”
_Wertpapierprospektgesetz, WpPG), as amended, and any other applicable laws applicable in Germany._
The Issuer has not, and does not intend to, file a securities prospectus with the German Federal Financial
Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für _Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) (“BaFin”) or obtain a_
notification to the BaFin from another competent authority of an EEA member state pursuant to Article
25 of the Prospectus Regulation. The Notes are not registered or authorised for distribution under the
Prospectus Regulation or under the Securities Prospectus Act and accordingly may not be, and are not
being, offered or advertised publicly or by public promotion. Therefore, this Offering Memorandum is
strictly for private use and the offer is only being made to recipients to whom the document is personally
addressed and does not constitute an offer or advertisement to the public. The Notes will only be
available to, and this Offering Memorandum and any other offering material in relation to the Notes is
directed only at, persons who are qualified investors (qualifizierte Anleger) within the meaning of
Section 2 No. 3 of the Securities Prospectus Act in connection with Article 2 lit. (e) of the Prospectus
Regulation or who are subject of another exemption in accordance with Article 1 of the Prospectus
Regulation. Any resale of the Notes in Germany may be made only in accordance with the Prospectus
Regulation and the Securities Prospectus Act and other applicable laws.


-----

**Italy**

No action has been or will be taken that could allow an offering of the Notes to the public in the Republic
of Italy (“Italy”) within the meaning of Article 1, paragraph 1(t), of Legislative Decree No. 58 of 24
February 1998, as subsequently integrated and amended from time to time (“Financial Services Act”).
Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold directly or indirectly in Italy, and neither this Offering
Memorandum nor any other offering circular, prospectus, form of application, advertisement, other
offering material or other information relating to the Issuer, the Guarantors, or the Notes may be issued,
distributed or published in Italy, either on the primary or on the secondary market, except:

(i) to qualified investors (investitori qualificati), as defined under Article 100 of the Financial
Services Act, as implemented by Article 35, paragraph 1(d), of Commissione Nazionale per le
Società e la Borsa (“CONSOB”) Regulation No. 20307 of 15 February 2018, as subsequently
integrated and amended from time to time (“Regulation No. 20307”), and by Article 34 ter,
paragraph 1(b), of CONSOB Regulation No. 11971 of 14 May 1999, as subsequently integrated
and amended from time to time (“Regulation No. 11971”); or

(ii) in other circumstances which are exempted from the rules on public offerings pursuant to Article
100 of the Financial Services Act and its implementing CONSOB regulations, including
Regulation No. 11971.

Any offer, sale or delivery of the Notes or distribution of copies of this Offering Memorandum or any
other document relating to the Notes in Italy under (i) or (ii) above must be:

(a) made by _soggetti abilitati (including an investment firm, bank or financial intermediary, as_
defined by Article 1, paragraph 1(r), of the Financial Services Act) permitted to conduct such
activities in Italy in accordance with the Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1933, as
amended (the “Banking Act”), the Financial Services Act, Regulation No. 20307 (in each case,
as amended from time to time) and any other applicable law and regulations;

(b) in compliance with Article 129 of the Banking Act, as amended, and the implementing guidelines
of the Bank of Italy, as amended from time to time, pursuant to which the Bank of Italy may
require data and information on the issue or the offer of securities in Italy; and

(c) in compliance with any other applicable laws and regulations or requirement, as well as with any
regulations or requirements imposed by CONSOB, the Bank of Italy or any other Italian
authority.

Any investor purchasing the Notes is solely responsible for ensuring that any offer or resale of the Notes
by such investor occurs in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

**United Kingdom**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be made
available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the
United Kingdom. For the purposes of this paragraph, a “retail investor” means a person who is one (or
more) of: (i) a “retail client,” as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it
forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a “customer” within the meaning of the
provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance
Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a “professional client,” as defined in
point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue
of the EUWA (“UK MiFIR”); or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined in Article 2 of the UK
Prospectus Regulation, and the expression an offer includes the communication in any form and by any
means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an
investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Notes. Consequently, no key information document
required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA


-----

(as amended, the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the Notes described in
the offering memorandum or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom
has been prepared and, therefore, offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them
available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs
Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the UK will
be made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law
by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from a requirement to publish a prospectus
for offers of Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus
Regulation.

**UK MIFIR Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market: Solely**
for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in the
United Kingdom in respect of the Notes described in the Offering Memorandum has led to the
conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the
Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) Handbook of Conduct of Business Sourcebook, and professional
clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional
clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a
“distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a
distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting
or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

This Offering Memorandum is only being distributed to and is only directed at (i) persons who are
outside the United Kingdom, (ii) persons who have professional experience in matters relating to
investments and are investment professionals as defined within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (the “Order”), (iii) high net worth bodies
corporate and any other person falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Order, or (iv) persons to
whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21
of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended), or “FSMA”), and any other persons to
whom it may otherwise lawfully be made in accordance with the Order or Section 21 of the FSMA (all
such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”).

Accordingly, by accepting delivery of this Offering Memorandum, the recipient warrants and
acknowledges that it is such a relevant person. The Notes are available to, and any invitation, offer or
agreement to subscribe, purchase or otherwise acquire such Notes will be engaged in only with, relevant
persons. Any person who is not a relevant person should not act or rely on this document or any of its
contents. No part of this Offering Memorandum should be published, reproduced, distributed or
otherwise made available in whole or in part to any other person without the prior written consent of
the Issuer. The Notes are not being offered or sold to any person in the United Kingdom, except in
circumstances which will not result in an offer of securities to the public in the United Kingdom within
the meaning of Part VI of the FSMA.

**Canada**

**_Resale Restrictions_**

The distribution of Notes in Canada is being made on a private placement basis exempt from the
requirement that we prepare and file a prospectus with the securities regulatory authorities in each
province where trades of these securities are made. Any resale of the Notes in Canada must be made
under applicable securities laws which may vary depending on the relevant jurisdiction, and which may
require resales to be made under available statutory exemptions or under a discretionary exemption


-----

granted by the applicable Canadian securities regulatory authority. Purchasers are advised to seek legal
advice prior to any resale of the securities.

**Representations of Canadian Purchasers**

Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations and that are not created or
used solely to purchase or hold securities as an accredited investor as described in paragraph (m) of the
definition of “accredited investor”. Any resale of the Notes must be made in accordance with an
exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the prospectus requirements of applicable securities
laws.

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with
remedies for rescission or damages if this Offering Memorandum (including any amendment thereto)
contains a misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the
purchaser within the time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or
territory. The purchaser should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the
purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of these rights or consult with a legal advisor.

Pursuant to section 3A.3 of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (NI 33-105), the Initial
Purchasers are not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding
underwriter conflicts of interest in connection with this offering.

Upon receipt of this Offering Memorandum, each Canadian investor hereby confirms that it has
expressly requested that all documents evidencing or relating in any way to the sale of the Notes
described herein (including for greater certainty any purchase confirmation or any notice) be drawn up

_par les présentes qu’il a expressément exigé que tous les documents faisant foi ou se rapportant de_
_quelque manière que ce soit à la vente des valeurs mobiliéres décrites aux présentes (incluant, pour_

The foregoing factors and others described under “Risk Factors” should not be construed as exhaustive.
Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forwardlooking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We urge you to read this Offering

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

**Presentation of Financial Information**

The Issuer was incorporated on 31 May 2019, for purposes of facilitating the Acquisition and
performing certain activities related thereto. The Issuer has no material assets, other than derivative
assets to hedge certain interest rate exposures arising from debt issued by the Issuer, equity interests in,
and/or intercompany balances with, other subsidiaries or affiliates of the Group. The Issuer has no
revenue generating activities of its own and no business operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related
_to the Notes and Our Structure—The Issuer and certain Guarantors are dependent upon cash flow from_
_their respective subsidiaries to meet their obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.”_

We have included in this Offering Memorandum the consolidated financial statements of JVco, which
is the indirect parent of MAL and the Issuer, as well as the level at which we report our consolidated
financial condition and results of operations on an ongoing basis. No separate financial statements of
MAL or the Issuer have been included in this Offering Memorandum.

The financial results of JVco and MAL are not directly comparable. In particular, certain line items
contained in the consolidated income statement and balance sheet included in the audited consolidated
financial statements of JVco and its subsidiaries as of and for the 53 weeks ended 31 December 2022
are not comparable to the corresponding line items contained in MAL’s financial statements for the
same period, as these are impacted by intra-group back-to-back loan arrangements.

Accordingly, unless otherwise stated, all references to “we,” “us,” “our,” “Group” or the “Merlin” in
respect of historical financial information in this Offering Memorandum are to JVco and its subsidiaries
on a consolidated basis.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. These standards also require management to exercise its judgment in the process
of applying accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or
areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are
disclosed in the financial statements.

The extracted consolidated financial information in this Offering Memorandum is presented in pounds
sterling rounded to the nearest million. Therefore, discrepancies between total figures and the sums of
the amounts listed may occur due to such rounding.

In making an investment decision, investors must rely upon their own examination of our business, the
terms of the offering and the financial information.

**Historical Financial Statements**

Unless otherwise indicated, the financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum is
extracted from the historical consolidated financial information of JVco and its subsidiaries. This
Offering Memorandum presents:

- the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of JVco and its subsidiaries as of
and for the 13 weeks ended 1 April 2023, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS;

- the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of JVco and its subsidiaries as of
and for the 13 weeks ended 26 March 2022, which have been prepared in accordance with
IFRS;

- the audited consolidated financial statements of JVco and its subsidiaries as of and for the 53
weeks ended 31 December 2022, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and
audited by our independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP; and


-----

- the audited consolidated financial statements of JVco and its subsidiaries as of and for the 52
weeks ended 25 December 2021, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and
audited by our independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, and which include comparative
financial information for the 52 weeks ended 26 December 2020.

For the purposes of this Offering Memorandum, we refer to the 52 weeks ended 26 December 2020 as
the “2020 financial year,” the 52 weeks ended 25 December 2021 as the “2021 financial year” and the
53 weeks ended 31 December 2022 as the “2022 financial year.” We prepare our annual financial
statements on the basis of a 52-week or 53-week financial period. Each of the 2020 financial year and
the 2021 financial year was a 52-week financial period. However, the 2022 financial year was a 53week financial period. Consequently, unless otherwise indicated, our results for the 2022 financial year
include an additional week of trading, which affects the comparability of our results of operations
between periods.

We refer to the 13 weeks ended 26 March 2022 as “Q1 2022” and the 13 weeks ended 1 April 2023 as
“Q1 2023.”

**_Restated Financial Statements_**

_Change in accounting policy relating to software-as-a-service (SaaS) arrangements_

In April 2021, the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) issued an
agenda decision in relation to the accounting treatment for configuration and customisation costs in
cloud computing arrangements. This decision clarified that in order for an intangible asset to be
capitalised in relation to configuration and customisation costs in a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”)
arrangement, it is necessary for there to be control of the underlying software asset or for there to be a
separate intangible asset which meets the definition in IAS 38 ‘Intangible assets’.

Since 2019, we have undertaken numerous technology-based projects that utilise SaaS arrangements.
We updated our accounting policy in the financial statements to align with the clarified guidance within
the IFRIC agenda decision. As a result, we have expensed all costs previously capitalised associated
with both the configuration and customisation of these SaaS arrangements. Accordingly, we restated
our consolidated statements of financial position for the 2020 financial year in accordance with IAS 8
‘Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors’.

The nature and impact of these amendments are explained in note 1.1 of the audited consolidated
financial statements for the 2021 financial year.

_Correction of errors_

We restated our audited consolidated financial statements for the 2020 financial year to reflect the
correction of certain errors that were identified during 2021. The amendments relate to the currency
used for valuation of certain brands at acquisition of MEL by MAL and adjustments due to identification
of certain deferred tax assets. The nature and impact of these amendments are explained in note 1.1 of
the audited consolidated financial statements for the 2021 financial year. These restatements have not
impacted previously reported underlying revenue or underlying EBITDA. This Offering Memorandum
reflects the restated amounts for the 2020 financial year.

**Other Operating, Financial and Pro Forma Financial Information**

In addition, we have included certain operating and financial information in this Offering Memorandum
as of and for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 financial years, Q1 2022 and Q1 2023 and the 53 weeks ended 1
April 2023, which has been prepared solely for the purpose of this Offering Memorandum, is for
illustrative purposes only, has not been audited or reviewed and is not necessarily indicative of our
results of operations for any future period or our financial condition at any future date.


-----

In this Offering Memorandum, we have also presented certain unaudited financial information for the
53 weeks ended 1 April, 2023, which is calculated by taking the results of operations of JVco for the
13 weeks ended 1 April, 2023, adding it to the results of operations for the 13 weeks ended 1 April,
2023, and subtracting the results of operations for the 13 weeks ended 26 March, 2022. The financial
information for the 53 weeks ended April 1, 2023 is not necessarily indicative of the results that may
be expected for the 52 weeks ending December 30, 2023, and should not be used as the basis for or
prediction of an annualized calculation. Such financial information has not been audited, is not required
by or presented in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and has
been prepared for illustrative purposes only. We believe that the financial information for the 53 weeks
ended 1 April 2023 is a useful indicator of our ability to develop our business and operating cash flow
and to serve our indebtedness. We present this information as it is the basis for certain ratios and as
adjusted financial information included in this Offering Memorandum that we believe is useful as
supplemental measures for investors in assessing the impact of the Refinancing and our ability to incur
and service our debt, including the Notes.

This Offering Memorandum includes unaudited _pro forma financial information, presented on an as_
adjusted basis, to illustrate the effect the Offering might have had on certain of our financial results for
the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2023 and as of 1 April 2023, as applicable. The unaudited _pro forma_
financial information is for informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or to be
indicative of the consolidated results of operations or financial position we would have reported had the
Offering been completed as of (i) 27 March 2022 for purposes of the calculation of EBITDA, operating
free cash flow and cash interest expense and (ii) 1 April 2023 for the purposes of the calculation of cash
and cash equivalents and net indebtedness (excluding leases). The unaudited _pro forma financial_
information should not be taken as indicative of our future consolidated results of operations or financial
position. Our historical results may not be indicative of our future results following completion of the
Offering. The unaudited pro forma financial information has not been prepared in accordance with any
generally accepted accounting standards. The unaudited pro forma financial information should be read
in conjunction with the information contained in “Use of Proceeds,” “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the historical financial statements of_
Merlin included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Non-IFRS Financial Information**

Certain financial measures and ratios related thereto in this Offering Memorandum, including EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (pre-IFRS 16), Segment EBITDA, operating free cash flow,
operating free cash flow conversion, Existing Estate capital expenditure, New Business Development
capital expenditure, revenue per capita and admissions revenue per capita (the “Non-IFRS Metrics”),
are not specifically defined under IFRS. These measures are presented in this Offering Memorandum
because they are measures our management uses to assess operating performance, and we believe that
they and similar measures are widely used in our industry as a means of evaluating a company’s
operating performance and financing structure, and because we believe they present helpful
comparisons of financial performance between periods by excluding the distorting effect of certain nonrecurring items. These measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other
companies and are not measurements under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting principles.

Our Non-IFRS Metrics have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in
isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results or any performance measures under IFRS as set
forth in our financial statements. Some of these limitations are:

- they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital commitments or
contractual commitments;

- they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;


-----

- they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or
principal payments on our debt;

- they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;

- they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our
consolidated income statement;

- they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider
not to be indicative of our ongoing operations;

- assets are depreciated or amortised over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be
replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such
replacements; and

- other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting
their usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, Non-IFRS Metrics should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute
for performance measures calculated in accordance with IFRS. You should compensate for these
limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS results and using these Non-IFRS Metrics only as
supplements to evaluate our performance. Please see “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated
_Financial and Other Data,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and_
_Results of Operations” and our historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes_
included elsewhere.

For a description of how our Non-IFRS Metrics are calculated from our consolidated profit/(loss) for
the year and a reconciliation of our Non-IFRS Metrics to our consolidated profit/(loss) for the year,
please see “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data.”

**_Existing Estate capital expenditure and New Business Development capital expenditure_**

Existing Estate capital expenditure, as used in this Offering Memorandum, represents capital
expenditure on our Existing Estate, which typically includes (i) adding new rides or displays and
enhancements to Attractions, (ii) replacing old features with new, more up to date ones and (iii) general
maintenance and refurbishment of existing Attractions (including ensuring health and safety standards
are met or exceeded)

New Business Development capital expenditure, as used in this Offering Memorandum, represents
capital expenditure on the development of new or upcoming Midway Attractions, LEGOLAND Parks,
Resort Theme Parks, accommodation at existing sites and “second gates.”

**_EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (pre-IFRS 16), Segment EBITDA and Segment_**
**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

EBITDA, as used in this Offering Memorandum, represents profit before finance income and costs,
taxation, depreciation, amortisation and impairment and is calculated after taking account of profit after
tax of joint ventures.

Adjusted EBITDA, as used in this Offering Memorandum, represents profit before finance income and
costs, taxation, depreciation, amortisation and impairment, share-based payments, exceptional items
and is after taking account of attributable profit after tax of joint controlled entities.

Adjusted EBITDA (pre-IFRS 16), as used in this Offering Memorandum, represents Adjusted EBITDA
_less adjustments made to exclude the impact of the application of IFRS 16 to Adjusted EBITDA._


-----

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (pre-IFRS 16) presented in this Offering
Memorandum do not reflect any weighted foreign exchange rate adjustments.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (pre-IFRS 16) may not be directly comparable with other
similarly titled measures or profit measures used by other companies.

Segment EBITDA, as used in this Offering Memorandum for the 2020 financial year, the 2021 financial
year and the 2022 finanical year, represents segment profit before exceptional items, finance income
and costs, taxation, depreciation, amortisation and impairment, and is after taking account of profit after
tax of joint ventures. Segment Adjusted EBITDA, as used in this Offering Memorandum for the Q1
2022 and Q1 2023 periods, represents segment profit before exceptional items, share-based payments,
finance income and costs, taxation, depreciation, amortisation and impairment, and is after taking
account of profit after tax of joint ventures. Certain costs are not allocated to individual operating groups
and are therefore not included within Segment EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Our segments
are the Midway Attractions, LEGOLAND Parks and Resort Theme Parks (together, the “Attractions”).

**_Operating Free Cash Flow, Unlevered free cash flow and Operating free cash flow Conversion_**

Operating free cash flow, as used in this Offering Memorandum, represents EBITDA less Existing
Estate capital expenditure. Operating free cash flow conversion, as used in this Offering Memorandum,
represents EBITDA less Existing Estate capital expenditure as a percentage of EBITDA.

Unlevered free cash flow, as used in this Offering Memorandum, represents operating free cash flow
less working capital and other movements less adjustments made to exclude the impact of the
application of IFRS 16 to EBITDA.

Operating free cash flow and operating free cash flow conversion are unaudited and are presented to
enhance a prospective investor’s understanding of our cash generation and provide prospective
investors with a useful supplemental measure for comparing our liquidity in respect of our operations
from period to period without the distortions of exceptional growth capital expenditure and other nonoperating items. Our management uses operating free cash flow as a key performance indicator of our
business and as an indicator of our ability to make strategic investments, repay our debt and meet other
payment obligations.

**_Revenue Per Capita and Admissions Revenue Per Capita_**

Revenue per capita, as used in this Offering Memorandum, is calculated by dividing total visitor revenue
by the number of visitors, excluding visitors to Attractions operated under management contracts
(which includes LEGOLAND Malaysia and LEGOLAND Dubai and THIS IS HOLLAND) and as part
of joint ventures (which include, for example, LEGOLAND Dubai Hotel). Visitor revenue includes
both revenue generated from admissions fees, including spend on fast track passes, and commercial
spend, including spend on food and beverages, retail purchases and souvenir photography. Revenue
generated from our hotel operations, private functions and sponsorships, as well as revenue generated
at Attractions operated under management contracts, including LEGOLAND Malaysia, LEGOLAND
Dubai, THIS IS HOLLAND, and under joint ventures, is not included in visitor revenue or revenue per
capita.

Revenue per capita data is unaudited and is presented to provide prospective investors with a
supplemental measure to evaluate our financial performance, enhancing comparison of results from
period to period and by operating group or Attraction by highlighting the visitor revenues achieved per
visitor, as opposed to aggregate visitor revenues which depend largely upon visitor numbers. Our
management uses revenue per capita as an indicator of profitability and yield and uses revenue per
capita to evaluate the performance of operating groups and Attractions from period to period.


-----

**Rounding**

Certain figures in this document, including financial information, have been subject to rounding
adjustments. Accordingly, in certain instances, (i) the sum or percentage change of such numbers may
not conform exactly to the total figure given and (ii) the sum of the numbers in a column or row in
certain tables may not conform exactly to the total figure given for that column or row.

**Overview**

We are a global leader in branded, location-based family entertainment. As of 1 April 2023, we operated
141 Attractions, 24 hotels and 6 holiday villages in 24 countries across four continents, and in the 53
weeks ended 31 December 2022, we welcomed approximately 56 million visitors to our Attractions.
We were the second largest theme park operator globally by number of visitors in 2019, according to
TEA/AECOM. We also own eight of Europe’s largest 20 theme parks by number of visitors as of 2021.
We believe we are a market leader in the United Kingdom, Northern Germany and Italy, based on total
visitor numbers in 2021 to Europe’s top 20 theme parks, with an already significant and growing
presence in the United States and the Asia Pacific region. We believe we own and/or operate a unique
portfolio of chainable iconic assets and brands, possessing strong heritage within their original markets,
as well as being globally scalable and supported by our extensive technical and creative expertise.

Our vision is to establish ourselves as the global leader in location-based entertainment. To this end, we
consider our main purpose to deliver memorable experiences to all our visitors, while maintaining a
strategy aimed at creating a high growth, high return, family entertainment business, naturally balanced
against the pressures of the macroeconomic environment in which we operate. We possess a unique
portfolio of family entertainment brands and iconic assets, which are highly diversified across
geography, attraction type, brand and customer demographic and well balanced between indoor and
outdoor Attractions and international and domestic visitation (with international and domestic visitation
measured relative to the relevant Attraction). We believe our footprint across 24 countries provides us
with a favourable platform to benefit from global growth in spending on travel and tourism, which
according to the WTTC, is forecast to increase by a CAGR of 5.1 per cent. per annum between 2023
and 2033 (from $9.5 trillion to $15.5 trillion), by allowing us to attract both international tourists and
domestic visitors, and providing us with a buffer in the event of macroeconomic and currency risks.
Our operating groups offer our visitors diverse entertainment options, including both indoor Attractions
within city centres as well as outdoor theme parks offering multi day visits. In the 53 weeks ended 1
April 2023, 45 per cent. of our revenue was derived from our LEGOLAND Parks and 22 per cent. of
our revenue was derived from our Resort Theme Parks operations, which are primarily organised around
outdoor activities, and 33 per cent. of our revenue was derived from our Midway Attractions operating
group, which is primarily organised around indoor activities, providing a natural hedge against weather
disruptions.

We have established a diverse portfolio of nationally and internationally recognised premium brands
focused on delivering memorable experiences to millions of visitors around the world. We generated
revenue of £2,084 million, Adjusted EBITDA of £717 million, Adjusted EBITDA (pre-IFRS 16) of
£601 million and profit before tax of £126 million in the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2023.

(1) Includes seven Second Gate Midway attractions. “Second-gate” attractions are visitor attractions at an existing resort with a separate

entrance and for which additional admission fees are charged. As of 1 April 2023, we maintain the following Second Gate Attractions:
SEA LIFE Attractions in proximity to LEGOLAND California, LEGOLAND Japan, LEGOLAND Malaysia and Gardaland Resort,
Dungeons in proximity to Warwick Castle and Alton Towers, and one Peppa Pig Theme Park in proximity to LEGOLAND Florida. The
financial results for our Second Gate attractions are reported within the associated operating group.

(2) Includes LEGOLAND Malaysia and LEGOLAND Dubai, which we operate under management contracts and LEGOLAND Japan,

which we operate under our “leased and operated” model.

(3) Visitor numbers include visitors to Attractions operated under management contracts (which, during the period presented, included

LEGOLAND Malaysia, LEGOLAND Dubai and THIS IS HOLLAND) and visitors to Attractions operated as joint ventures.

(4) Revenue per segment excludes the impact of other items in the amount of £(1) million, which cannot be directly attributed to the

reportable operating groups.

(5) Segment EBITDA for the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2023 excludes the impact of other expense items in the amount of £70 million,

including Merlin Magic Making, head office costs and various other costs, which cannot be directly attributed to the reportable operating
groups.

Our three Operating Groups are supported by internal teams including our in-house innovation and
product delivery group, Merlin Magic Making (“MMM”), which includes teams across Europe, North


-----

America and the Asia Pacific region. MMM is responsible for driving innovation across our group.
These teams capture a combination of skills, including research, creative, production and project
management. We also maintain specific resources within our Operating Groups which are dedicated to
researching future opportunities, searching out locations for potential new attractions and negotiating
with local landlords, developers and civic bodies, while also managing a wide range of construction
projects including individual rides and attractions to improve our Existing Estate and leverage organic
growth opportunities.

Moreover, MMM creates compelling propositions and develops new concepts into commercially viable
attractions. Our in-house production capabilities include bespoke content such as wax figures, attraction
theming and LEGO model production, thereby creating efficiencies and reducing costs. MMM is central
to our major projects. In 2022, these projects included MMM’s work to develop LEGOLAND Korea
and the LEGOLAND Korea hotel, the Peppa Pig Theme Park Florida, a Second Gate attraction (which
are visitor attractions at an existing resort with a separate entrance and for which additional admission
fees are charged), adjacent to LEGOLAND Florida Resort, LEGO Discovery Center, Brussels and
Peppa Pig World of Play in Leideschendam, Netherlands, all of which opened in 2022.

As part of the ongoing development of our footprint, we also manage construction projects including
for individual rides and attractions in our Existing Estate, new Midway attractions across the globe and
also engage in the development of full-scale LEGOLAND resorts, the latter through a range of
ownership models which we deploy when pursuing new locations. Capital expenditure for our
LEGOLAND projects which are under a management contract model, are generally not incurred by us
directly, but rather by our local partners. For example, the capital expenditure related to our
LEGOLAND Shenzhen and LEGOLAND Sichuan resorts are incurred by our local partners, while the
capital expenditure related to the LEGOLAND Shanghai resort is incurred by a joint venture in which
we are a minority investor. We also leverage our extensive experience to provide an opportunity for
investors to develop location-based entertainment offerings, and to take on the operation of other
parties’ attractions under management contracts.

We believe that our Attractions continue to broaden our appeal in different markets and geographies,
and reflect the increasing volume and strength of our relationships with third-party intellectual property
holders who seek to leverage their content through location-based entertainment. In 2021, we opened
four LEGOLAND Discovery Centres, which comprised two locations in the USA (San Francisco Bay
Area, and New Jersey), one location in the Netherlands and one in Hong Kong. Moreover, we further
strengthened our USA footprint by opening two SEA LIFE Centres in San Antonio and New Jersey,
along with a Peppa Pig World of Play attraction in Chicago. Over the same period, we also opened a
Madame Tussauds attraction in Dubai (UAE). In 2022, we completed the acquisition of the COEX
Aquarium in Seoul, South Korea, and have taken over the operations of the Cadbury World Attraction
in the UK. Over the same period, we also opened one additional indoor Peppa Pig World of Play
attraction in Leidschendam, one standalone Peppa Pig theme park close to LEGOLAND Florida Resort,
a LEGO Discovery Centre in Brussels (Belgium) and have taken over the management contract of
Amsterdam’s THIS IS HOLLAND flying theatre experience.

Our strategy and performance is underpinned by our commitment to operational excellence and is
driven by an integrated approach to quality management, capital investment, marketing and pricing,
together with a focus on health and safety. We believe that our rebound from COVID-19, highlighted
by strong financial returns in 2022, is also the result of our efficient and strategic deployment of capital
expenditure across the Existing Estate and new Attractions.

We have demonstrated the strength of our diversified business model through our historical financial
track record. The drivers of this performance are:

- investment in our Existing Estate to grow demand, improve customer satisfaction, and where
applicable, to increase capacity. Increasingly, these investments are made in partnership with
leading intellectual property owners to provide immersive, themed experiences for our visitors


-----

(such as “Jumanji — The Adventure” which opened at Gardaland in 2022 and “World of
_Jumanji” which recently opened at Chessington World of Adventures, both part of our multi-_
territory exclusivity agreement with Sony Pictures Entertainment);

- developing new LEGOLAND Parks, including the opening of LEGOLAND New York in 2021
(which included a 250-room hotel), LEGOLAND Korea in 2022 (which included a 154-room
hotel), the targeted opening of LEGOLAND Sichuan resort, LEGOLAND Shanghai resort and
LEGOLAND Shenzhen resort in China, each of which are expected to be during or after 2025,
and potentially other new LEGOLAND Parks in the rest of the world, subject to targeted return
on investment criteria;

- open new Midway Attractions as part of our chainable global brands to drive our organic
revenue growth, with a focus on developing “cluster” locations (where multiple Attractions are
situated in one city or region to capitalise on cross-selling, including through our multi
attraction pass opportunities) and new sites outside of Europe, including in emerging markets.
For example, in 2022, we opened a Peppa Pig World of Play Attraction in Leidschendam (the
Netherlands), a LEGO Discovery Centre in Brussels (Belgium) and have taken over the
management contract for Amsterdam’s THIS IS HOLLAND flying theatre experience, thereby
expanding our local clusters of attractions. We are also expecting to open a LEGO Discovery
Center in Springfield, Washington D.C. in 2023;

- transforming our Theme Parks into destination resorts by deploying a broad range of themed
accommodation and new Attractions, with the aim to improve our customer satisfaction and
drive multi day visitation. For example, in 2021 we opened a LEGOLAND Water Park at our
Gardaland Resort and in 2022 we launched our first standalone Peppa Pig theme park, close to
our LEGOLAND Florida premises. In addition, we are expecting to open the UK’s first LEGO
themed holiday village at LEGOLAND Windsor Resort in 2024, featuring 150 lodges and one
on-site restaurant, complemented by a family entertainment hub;

- acquisitions and new-format opportunities to enhance our portfolio and enable us to grow into
new geographies. For example, in 2022 we completed the acquisition of the COEX Aquarium
in Seoul, South Korea, and have taken over the operations of the Cadbury World Attraction in
the UK. In addition, we also routinely develop new formats of attractions. Currently, our focus
is on Peppa Pig branded attractions aimed at pre-school children. To date, we have opened five
pilot indoor Peppa Pig World of Play attractions (including the one in Leidschendam in 2022),
and one standalone Peppa Pig theme park close to LEGOLAND Florida Resort. We are
planning to open a second Peppa Pig theme park in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in 2024.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

**_Unique Portfolio of Strong Brands and Iconic Assets_**

We own and/or operate a unique global portfolio of brands and iconic assets which we believe are
widely recognised by consumers from a wide range of demographic groups, enabling us to differentiate
our attractions from unbranded operators. Our portfolio of assets and brands is highly diversified across
geography, attraction type, brand and customer demographic and well balanced between indoor and
outdoor attractions and international and domestic visitation. Our well diversified portfolio makes us
well-positioned to meet both short-break and intra-day customer demands. We also partner with thirdparty intellectual property owners to create new brands which complement the portfolio and broaden
our appeal across all key target demographics.

Our Midway Attractions portfolio includes chainable brands such as SEA LIFE, Madame Tussauds and
lastminute.com London Eye, while our Resort Theme Parks attractions such as Gardaland Resort and
Alton Towers Resort, are standalone national brands in their respective markets. In addition, our
LEGOLAND Parks benefit from a mutually synergistic relationship with the LEGO Group, one of the
world’s leading toys’ brands associated with fun and learning through play, that recently celebrated its


-----

90[th] anniversary. The LEGO Group operates in over 100 countries with a global footprint of over 900
stores, based on publicly available information. Our portfolio is focused on delivering high quality
family entertainment, with the LEGOLAND Parks and LEGO/LEGOLAND Discovery Centres in
particular placing an emphasis on “playful learning.” We believe the strength and breadth of our iconic
brand portfolio enable us to offer compelling entertainment propositions through a wide variety of
activities and visitor experiences across a broad range of geographies. This allows us to attract a wide
range of target demographic groups, ranging from families with young children, teenagers, young adults
to older adults. We also believe that the size and diversity of our portfolio provides us with a degree of
resilience against short-term trading shocks which may impact a particular geography, brand or
demographic.

_Midway Attractions_

Our Midway Attractions benefit from high quality, chainable brands with broad international appeal
and recognition, which are distributed across geographies, markets and target demographics, creating a
diversified portfolio. As of 1 April 2023, we operate 25 Midway Attractions in the United Kingdom, 31
Midway Attractions in Continental Europe, 34 Midway Attractions in the Americas and 35 Midway
Attractions in the Asia Pacific region. Our 125 Midway Attractions (including Second Gate Attractions)
were distributed across four continents and included:

- Madame Tussauds, the world’s premier wax figures exhibition for over 200 years, where
visitors are encouraged to interact with historical and celebrity figures in both more mature and
emerging markets, comprising 22 Attractions in 12 countries;

- The Eye brand and observation Attractions with iconic, and internationally recognised
landmarks such as the lastminute.com London Eye and the Sydney Tower Eye;

- SEA LIFE, the world’s largest aquarium brand, comprising 47 Attractions in 19 countries, with
a strong name recognition and a track record of providing high quality and informative family
entertainment for over 40 years and campaigning actively on a variety of conservation issues
prioritised around breeding, rescue and protection of the marine environment;

- The Dungeons, comprising ten attractions in four countries with a strong reputation amongst
the teen and young adult market for a unique mix of dark, historical horror and irreverent
humour, delivered through set piece shows performed by live actors, rides and themed sets;

- LEGO/LEGOLAND Discovery Centres, an extension of the LEGOLAND brand to the Midway
Attractions format, offering the same values of interactivity and family fun in a smaller, more
accessible format, comprising 28 Attractions in ten countries, including the LEGO Discovery
Centre opened in Brussels in 2022; and

- Five Peppa Pig World of Play Attractions, comprising a range of attractions aimed at pre-school
children and based on the Peppa Pig brand, featuring family inclusive activities in an immersive
play environment and one Peppa Pig theme park, which features multiple rides, interactive
attractions, themes play-scapes and shows, all based on the Peppa Pig brand.

In addition, we routinely enhance our Midway Attractions portfolio by adding new Attractions. For
example, in 2022, we opened a Peppa Pig World of Play Attraction in Leidschendam (the Netherlands),
a LEGO Discovery Centre in Brussels (Belgium) and have taken over the management contract of
Amsterdam’s THIS IS HOLLAND flying theatre experience, thereby expanding our local clusters of
attractions. Lastly, we are expecting to open a LEGO Discovery Center in Springfield, Washington DC
in 2023. In 2022 we also completed the acquisition of the COEX Aquarium in Seoul, South Korea,
thereby adding a further significant attraction to the SEA LIFE portfolio, and have taken over the
operations of Cadbury World in the UK, which allowed us to strengthen our relationship with the UK’s
largest chocolate brand.


-----

Other Midway Attractions include two Treetop Walk experiences in Victoria and New South Wales,
Australia, one WILD LIFE Australian animal adventure Attractions in Sydney, “DreamWorks Tours’
_Shrek’s Adventure!”_ Midway Attraction in London, “Bear Grylls Adventure” Midway Attraction in
Birmingham and two “Little BIG City” Midway Attractions in Berlin and Beijing.

Our scale and portfolio of strong brands has allowed us to leverage a number of strategic synergies. We
have developed “clusters” of Midway Attractions in Amsterdam, Arizona, Bangkok, Beijing, Berlin,
Birmingham, Blackpool, Chicago, Dallas, Hong Kong Istanbul, Kansas City, London, Manchester,
Melbourne, Michigan, New Jersey, Oberhausen, Orlando, San Antonio, Scheveningen, Shanghai,
Shenyang, Sydney and Tokyo, where multiple Attractions are situated in one city or region to capitalise
on strong cross promotional and operational synergies, including multi attraction tickets to drive crossselling.

_LEGOLAND Resorts and Parks_

The LEGO brand is globally recognised and is associated with fun and learning through play. We hold
the global, exclusive license to own and operate LEGOLAND Parks until at least 2075. We own and/or
operate ten LEGOLAND Parks in eight countries. The parks are located in Denmark, Germany,
Malaysia, the United Kingdom, Dubai, California, Florida, New York, South Korea and Japan, all of
which build on the strength of the LEGO brand and are themed and interactive parks, which are
designed to appeal to families (particularly with children aged two to twelve years) looking for a fun
and engaging day out.

We have significantly expanded our LEGOLAND offering in recent years with the opening of
LEGOLAND New York in 2021 and LEGOLAND Korea in 2022. We operate the parks in Malaysia
and Dubai under management contracts. LEGOLAND Japan is “leased and operated,” meaning a thirdparty partner (a subsidiary of KIRKBI) funded the acquisition of the park site, the development of the
infrastructure and the basic construction while we funded and built the rides, provided the necessary
theming and built the on-site SEA LIFE Centre second gate and the on-site accommodation. We lease
the site on a long-term basis and operate the park.

In addition, we are also developing three LEGOLAND Parks in China in cooperation with local
partners. Each of LEGOLAND Sichuan resort, LEGOLAND Shanghai resort and LEGOLAND
Shenzhen resort is expected to open during or after 2025. All three will be operated under a management
contract model.

All of our open LEGOLAND Parks have themed on site hotels ranging from 61 to 263 rooms. During
the 2022 financial year, we opened a 250-room hotel at LEGOLAND Dubai, in partnership with the
park’s owners, and a 154-room hotel at LEGOLAND Korea. In addition, during the 2021 financial year
we opened a 250-room hotel at LEGOLAND New York and in the 2020 financial year we opened a
150 room LEGOLAND Florida Pirate Island hotel. Adding on site, themed accommodation has
historically improved guest satisfaction, increased the catchment area for our parks, increased the level
of pre booked revenue and improved cross-selling opportunities. We routinely consider potential plans
for adding additional accommodation at our LEGOLAND parks in future years. For example, we are
developing and plan to open in May 2024 a LEGOLAND Woodland Village, the UK’s first LEGO
themed holiday village, at LEGOLAND Windsor Resort. LEGOLAND Woodland Village will feature
150 lodges, an on-site restaurant, and a family entertainment hub. We believe these hotels and villages
provide an integral contribution to the overall customer experience and help drive increases in multi
day ticket sales.

We also have four Second Gate attractions close to our LEGOLAND Parks, including SEA Life
attractions alongside each of LEGOLAND California, Japan and Malaysia and a Peppa Pig Theme Park
close to LEGOLAND Florida.


-----

_Resort Theme Parks_

Each of our six Resort Theme Parks is a standalone national brand in their respective markets, aimed at
families, teenagers and young adults, with themed accommodation at all locations. For example,
THORPE PARK Resort focuses especially on the teen and young adult markets whereas Chessington
World of Adventures Resort is orientated more towards families. Each of our Resort Theme Parks,
certain of which are among the leading theme parks in the UK, Italy and Northern Germany, enjoys
high brand and customer awareness in its local market. We also have three Second Gate attractions near
our Resort Theme Parks, including Dungeons Warwick Castle, Dungeons Alton Towers and SEA LIFE
Gardaland.

We believe that each of our Resort Theme Parks offers a compelling, coherent proposition and strong
theming, with few or no local competitors that can offer the same quality or scale of visitor experience.
We aim to implement effective marketing and promotions to ensure that each brand is the strongest in
its relevant market. Our Resort Theme Parks are recognised as destination resorts, attracting short break
visits from national and, in certain cases, international visitors, supported by short break marketing
campaigns. Each of our Resort Theme Parks has one or more hotels or holiday villages.

Each of our Resort Theme Parks is strongly positioned in its national/regional market, often representing
the pre-eminent visitor attraction in its respective region and benefiting from being situated in a
prominent location with good transport links to areas of substantial populations. In particular, we
believe we have a market leading position in the United Kingdom, as we own the top four UK theme
parks (by number of visitors in 2021) according to the TEA/AECOM Report for 2021: LEGOLAND
Windsor (part of our LEGOLAND Parks operating group), Alton Towers Resort, THORPE PARK
Resort and Chessington World of Adventures Resort (all part of our Resort Theme Parks). We also
believe we hold leading market positions in Italy and Northern Germany, in each case by number of
visitors to Europe’s top 20 theme parks in 2021.

The scale of our Resort Theme Parks and available undeveloped land at certain locations has also
provided opportunities for Second Gate attractions. For example, there is a SEA LIFE centre located
close to Gardaland Resort and a Dungeons Warwick Castle on the Warwick Castle site.

**_Intellectual Property Partnerships_**

Given our global reach and multi-format expertise, we believe we are well placed to benefit from the
growing opportunities to partner with leading owners of intellectual property content, which enables us
to deliver memorable experiences to our visitors and offer our partners opportunities to increase
engagement with their customers. We maintain a core global, multi-product and exclusive relationship
with the LEGO Group. In particular, we hold the global, exclusive rights to the LEGOLAND brand
under the licensing and co-operation agreement with KIRKBI, our largest shareholder. We have a
synergistic relationship with the LEGO Group and KIRKBI A/S, which as of 31 December 2022, is a
75 per cent. shareholder of the LEGO Group with a 100 per cent. ownership of the LEGO and
LEGOLAND trademarks and a 47.49 per cent. shareholder of JVco.

We maintain multiple other intellectual property agreements, ranging from local relationships for
specific attractions, to global, multi-product relationships. These include our multi-territory exclusivity
arrangement to develop a range of attractions based on the Peppa Pig brand, an established global brand
aimed at pre-school children. In addition, we established multiple other intellectual property
partnerships, allowing us to use brands such as Ghostbusters, the Gruffalo, Shrek, Bear Grylls, Kung
Fu Panda, Ferrari and CBeebies, the latter through our partnership with BBC Worldwide. We also
continue to develop new global intellectual property partnerships. For example, in 2022 we opened a
“JUMANJI — The Adventure” ride and, in 2023, a “JUMANJI: The Labyrinth” ride in our Gardaland
Theme Resort, as part of our multi-territory exclusivity agreement with Sony Pictures Entertainment, to
develop and operate attractions, rides, lands, retail outlets and themed hotel rooms based on the studio’s
“Jumanji” film franchise. In 2023, we have also opened a “World of Jumanji” themed land at our


-----

Chessington World of Adventures Theme Park Resort, along with Jumanji-themed rooms at the local
resort hotel, and a Jumanji themed rollercoaster.

The below chart shows our key intellectual property partnerships and attractions arrangements:

We intend to continue developing further global, regional and local relationships with additional
intellectual property and content owners over the coming years, by building on the success of our
existing relationships.

**_Long Term Attractive Market Trends_**

We believe that we operate in an attractive market benefiting from underlying growth characteristics
and favourable dynamics, such as long-term increases in leisure spending, including in emerging
economies. Notwithstanding the recent impact of the COVID 19 pandemic, we believe the global leisure
market possesses a number of attractive features that facilitate growth over the long-term. These include
increasing leisure time in both developed and emerging economies, the value placed on time spent
together with friends and family and growing tourism to gateway cities.

This is underpinned by our long-term belief in domestic as well as international tourism, where we
experienced a strong post-COVID recovery during 2022. We continue to see long-term growth
opportunities from tourism more widely, which benefits our resorts and drives visitation to our gateway
city locations, where we operate our Midway attraction clusters.

According to the WTTC, travel and tourism’s contribution to the global economy is forecast to increase
by a CAGR of 5.1 per cent. per annum between 2023 and 2033, which reflects faster growth than that
of the global economy. A key indicator measuring the size of the tourism industry is the number of
international tourist arrivals. According to the UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), in 2019,
tourism growth continued to outpace the global economy, with approximately 1.5 billion international
tourist arrivals, which is an increase of approximately 4 per cent. over the previous year.

We also expect to experience continuing growth in domestic short break holidays (typically composed
of one-to three-day stays). According to the ONS, short breaks taken abroad by UK residents have
grown at a CAGR of 5.5 per cent. per annum from 2009-2019 period, increasing from 6 million short
break holidays taken in 2009 to 10.3 million in 2019. We are increasingly well-positioned to meet this
demand through our combined offering of themed, on-site accommodation and Second Gate attractions
that extend the duration of our visitors’ stay. Accommodation offerings also enable greater cross-selling
opportunities, drive improved levels of guest satisfaction, and lead to increases in pre-bookings, revenue
visibility and positive working capital. Our domestically focused resort positioning also provides a
partial hedge against the impact of macro-economic or geopolitical volatility on international tourism
(including because of COVID-19, as well as the current cost-of-living crisis and inflation) due to the
relatively lower cost of domestic short-break holidays. According to the WTTC, global domestic
tourism increased to a 85 per cent. share in 2021, compared to 72 per cent. in 2019. We believe that our
business has historically demonstrated resilience during periods of economic slowdown and
geopolitical volatility. We believe that consumer spending on family visitor Attractions tends to be


-----

more resistant to cutbacks than many other forms of discretionary spending during periods of economic
downturn because visiting our Attractions may represent a less expensive holiday or leisure alternative
compared to overseas travel holidays for domestic customers in the countries in which we operate.
Additionally, the Attractions may represent a less expensive holiday or leisure alternative compared to
overseas travel holidays for domestic customers in the countries in which we operate.

In addition, we believe that the short break market is growing in many of the countries and regions in
which we operate and, in particular, in key destination cities, such as London, Berlin, Sydney and
Shanghai. According to the Office for National Statistics, in the UK, short breaks taken by UK residents
to visit abroad have grown at an average rate of 5.5 per cent. per annum from 2009-19 period, while the
growth rate of longer holidays (14-27 nights) over the same period was -0.1 per cent. per annum.

We maintain a long-term belief in international tourism. We also seek to benefit from opportunities
arising from tourism more widely, which benefits our Resort Theme Parks and drives visitors to our
gateway city locations (where we operate our Midway Attraction clusters). We estimate that in the 2022
financial year, 77 per cent. of visitors to our Attractions were domestic visitors (as compared with 72
per cent. in the 2019 financial year) and 23 per cent. were international tourists (as compared with 28
per cent. in the 2019 financial year), based on a survey of a sample of our visitors. This survey highlights
a higher weighting of domestic visitors, than we expect for a typical year in the future, as a result of
lower levels in international tourism recorded in recent periods compared to typical pre-pandemic
levels.

While the COVID-19 pandemic had a particularly serious effect on the travel and tourism industry, in
2022, international tourist arrivals totalled 917 million and grew by 102 per cent. compared to 2021,
according to the UNWTO, representing strong recovery. We have Attractions in eight of the top ten
cities ranked as top city destinations for 2022.

Moreover, theme park attendance continues to grow globally. According to the TEA/AECOM Theme
Index and Museum Index: The Global Attractions Attendance Report (2021), attendance at the top 25
global theme parks has grown by 70 per cent., from approximately 83 million visitors in 2020 to
approximately 141 million visitors in 2021. Such strong recovery in 2021 was largely influenced by the
easing up of COVID-related travel restrictions, the success of COVID-19 vaccine administration, and
general consumer confidence levels. According to the 2012-2019 TEA/AECOM Reports, Theme park
attendance on an average grew by 3 per cent. per annum from 2012 to 2019 across all major markets.

**_Strong Market Positions with High Guest Satisfaction Underpinning High Revenue per Capita_**

According to the TEA/AECOM Report for 2019, we were the second largest theme park operator
globally by number of visitors in 2019. We also own eight of Europe’s largest 20 theme parks by number
of visitors as of 2021. Each of our operating groups commands a strong market share within its market
and benefits from competitive advantages. The strength of our brand and our experience in the industry
is supported by a consistent track record of high guest satisfaction and growing revenues per capita. We
believe that our ongoing product investment and innovation, and strong focus on creating memorable
experiences for our guests, have resulted in continued strong levels of guest satisfaction. In 2022 and
2021, we delivered an overall guest satisfaction score across our group of 94 per cent. and a “Net
_Promoter” score above 50 per cent., which measures the propensity for our guests to recommend our_
Attractions. Moreover, our “top box” measure (i.e., the highest level of customer satisfaction that we
record in our customer surveys, indicating when guests are “very satisfied”) and our value for money
rating have also increased in 2022 compared to 2021.


-----

Our guest satisfaction has consistently ranked above our 90 per cent. benchmark since 2008, as shown
by the graph below:

We believe that high guest satisfaction is driven, in part by our ability to deliver shorter queues (with
lower waiting times for rides) and an overall pleasant experience for our visitors. In addition to driving
visitation, we believe that high guest satisfaction scores also contribute to our revenue growth and is
therefore important for our long-term success. In particular, our revenue per capita increased from £22.3
in 2019 to £30.1 in 2022, respectively, underpinning an increasing willingness by visitors who have a
positive experience at our Attractions to spend more (including on our other services and activities).

This increase is also supported by robust customer demand, particularly at our domestically-focused
attractions in the UK, the US and Continental Europe, by our active management of peak day capacity
and by our revenue management initiatives, which allow us to pass increased costs to visitors. Our
revenue management initiatives are also complemented by a dynamic approach to capacity
management, which we tailor to ensure optimal staffing levels and associated costs across our
attractions.

We believe that the strong market position and breadth of the operations of our Resort Theme Parks,
LEGOLAND Parks and Midway Attractions are also supported by our historic investment in each
category. In particular, our existing portfolio of strong brands and use of the LEGO brand offer a
compelling proposition that distinguishes our business. In each of our three operating groups, we benefit
from in house technical and creative capacity, well located sites in attractive markets, permits and
branding relationships.

We also retain a number of competitive advantages in the Midway Attractions operating group. These
advantages include strong brand recognition in connection with existing brands such as Madame
Tussauds, SEA LIFE, the Eye and the LEGO and LEGOLAND brands used by our
LEGO/LEGOLAND Discovery Centres, our own in house Merlin Magic Making team which includes
wax sculptors, our SEA LIFE marine biologists and our ability to operate our Midway Attractions as
part of “clusters,” where multiple Attractions are situated in one city or region to capitalise on crossselling, including through our multi attraction pass opportunities. A popular package amongst customers
is the sale of annual and monthly passes, which are purchased online or at our parks for a one off price
that enables customers to visit all Attractions within a particular country for one year for no additional
admission fee.

In addition, our scale also allows us to capitalise on operating cost efficiencies, including marketing
costs, central management, site development expertise and application of visitor management
experiences across our portfolio.

We also expect to see continuing growth in domestic short break holidays, primarily due to their lower
cost. We believe we are increasingly well-positioned to meet this demand through our offering of
themed, on-site accommodation and Second Gate attractions that extend the duration of our visitors’
stay. Accommodation offerings also enable greater cross-selling opportunities, drive improved levels
of guest satisfaction, and lead to increases in pre-bookings, revenue visibility and positive working

capital. In addition, we believe that domestically-focused resort positioning also provides a partial
hedge against the impact of macro-economic or geopolitical volatility on international tourism.

**_Efficient and Synergistic Operating Model_**

We continue to leverage the scale and synergies within our Group to achieve enhanced revenue
generation as well as operational, marketing and buying power. At the same time, we continue to focus
on operational excellence, delivering memorable experiences for our guests, simplifying our operations
and maximising the synergies afforded by our scale.

We believe that our operating model has developed as our scale has grown, allowing us to operate more
efficiency and flexibly, while maintaining our focus on providing a high-quality experience for our
visitors. In particular, we have re-engineered how we react to changes in guest volumes, applying
dynamic pricing and promotional strategies with a focus on yield management. Our operations are
aimed at managing visitor numbers through periods of high and low attendance volume, extending the
length of stay, encouraging repeat visits, and enhancing overall revenue by also improving our
customers’ online “digital journey.” In addition, we believe that our ability to maintain tight control
over attraction capacities during peak season and lowering peak day volumes delivers a tangible
improvement in the guest experience, increases rides per guest, reduces queuing, and improves average
guest spends.

In key cities including London, Sydney and Tokyo, we developed “clusters” by deploying multiple
Midway Attractions in one urban area or region, with the aim to capitalise on strong cross promotional
and operational synergies, including multi attraction pass opportunities, to drive cross-selling. For
example, in 2022, we opened a Peppa Pig World of Play Attraction in Leidschendam (the Netherlands),
a LEGO Discovery Centre in Brussels (Belgium) and have taken over the management contract of
Amsterdam’s THIS IS HOLLAND flying theatre experience, thereby expanding our local clusters. Our
clustering drive is supplemented by our scale and portfolio diversification of strong brands, which also
allows us to leverage a number of strategic synergies and operate more efficiency and flexibly, while
maintaining our focus on providing a high-quality experience for our visitors.

In addition, we continue to transform our theme parks into destination resorts, thereby extending visitor
market reach and enhancing revenues by unlocking multiple sales channels (including
accommodations), driven by overall visit durations being extended to longer than a single day. We also
invest in ongoing opportunities to drive visitation at our theme parks by opening Second Gate
attractions. For example, we operate a SEA LIFE centre close to Gardaland Resort and a Dungeons
Warwick Castle on the premises of the Warwick Castle site while in 2022 we opened Peppa Pig Theme
Park in Florida, next to LEGOLAND Florida. In addition, we are also planning to open the UK’s first
LEGO themed holiday village at LEGOLAND Windsor Resort in 2024.

Our scale also allows us to benefit from procurement cost efficiencies within clusters, countries, or
regions, while in certain territories our Merlin Annual Pass and Merlin Pass Monthly Memberships
enable our customers to visit all attractions within a particular country for an upfront or monthly fee. In
addition, we maintain Attraction-specific annual passes, allowing visitors to visit a particular attraction
for one year and monthly membership schemes at our North American LEGOLAND Parks. Merlin
Annual Passes can be purchased for a one-off price and enable our customers to visit all Attractions
within a particular country for one year for no additional admission fee, subject to occasional
restrictions, including certain ‘restricted days’. We use the Merlin Annual Pass and the Merlin Pass
Monthly Membership to drive visitor loyalty and brand awareness, to provide us with revenue visibility,
to secure cash flows in advance and to increase levels of secondary spending (including commercial
spending) at the Attractions. We also intend to invest in developing a reliable technological
infrastructure, to support our growth.

We also adopted national promotions at Group level, comprising promotional discounts, or national
marketing campaigns in conjunction with local partners. We also partner with specialist outsourcing


-----

providers in areas such as food and beverage offerings. We believe that higher volumes for an individual
Attraction can be achieved through the use of entry promotions and admission fee discounts. and we
can use such promotions and discounts to distribute visitor attendance across an Attraction’s opening
hours or opening period.

We have also been transforming our support functions through shared service centre initiatives such as
our recent “finance transformation project”. To date, over two-thirds of the value of our revenues are
generated from Attractions whose accounting is managed through our shared service centre.

**_Wide-ranging In-house Development Capabilities_**

We offer an end-to-end value proposition, ranging from research and development to innovation, which
we leverage to run our world class Attractions. In particular, our three operating groups are supported
by teams including our in-house innovation and product delivery group, MMM, which includes teams
across Europe, North America and the Asia Pacific region. Together, such teams capture a unique
combination of skills, including research, creative, production and project management, delivering an
end-to-end value proposition from conceptualisation, development and day-to-day running of
attractions.

We maintain specific resources within our operating groups that are dedicated to researching future
opportunities, searching out locations for potential new attractions and negotiating with local landlords,
developers and civic bodies. Our LEGOLAND Parks, in addition to the LEGO Discovery Center,
Brussels, which opened in 2022 and the LEGO Discovery Center in Springfield, Washington D.C.,
which is expected to open in 2023, represent prime examples of these efforts. In addition, our MMM
team is our in-house specialist team in charge of activities which include the creation of compelling
propositions and development of new concepts into commercially viable attractions. MMM also
supports our other team in pursuing acquisition and investment opportunities, while cooperating in
creative design, production, and project management tasks. Our in-house production capabilities
include bespoke content such as wax figures, attraction theming and LEGO model production, thereby
creating efficiencies and reducing costs. For example, the castle rooms at our Warwick Castle Resort
contain a variety of exhibits and artefacts, including bespoke wax figures depicting aspects of the
castle’s history that have been produced by our MMM team. Our MMM team’s inputs were also
instrumental in finalizing major projects including the “Jumanji” themed rides and accommodations at
our Gardaland and Chessington World of Adventure Theme Park Resorts and our first Peppa Pig Theme
Park as a Second Gate attraction in close proximity to our LEGOLAND Florida site and the “LEGO
_Ferrari Build and Race” at our LEGOLAND California Resort, as well as for new Midway Attractions_
we recently deployed and our Peppa Pig World of Play sites. We also maintain teams focusing on
developing and monitoring our health, safety and security programmes, with the aim to deliver industry
leading health, safety and security standards, and work closely with our recruiting and training teams,
to ensure our workforce has the right skills to be the best at what they do and fulfil their potential in
their career with us.

Through our in-house capabilities, we are able to develop and run attractions of varying scale, also
managing the related construction processes. In 2022, we completed the construction and opened
LEGOLAND Korea, which is fully owned and operated by us and, as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, we are developing three LEGOLAND Parks in China in cooperation with local partners.

We also believe that our extensive experience in the leisure and entertainment industry represents an
opportunity for investors to develop joint entertainment offerings. For example, we are developing three
LEGOLAND Parks in China in cooperation with local partners (LEGOLAND Sichuan resort,
LEGOLAND Shanghai resort and LEGOLAND Shenzhen resort).


-----

**_Well-Diversified Portfolio_**

Through our broad portfolio of Attractions, our overall business is diversified across geography,
attraction type, brand and customer demographic. This diversification helps us deliver strong financial
results across a variety of different market conditions and to minimise the impact of external factors,
such as regional economic performance, extreme weather and other external factors. We estimate that
in the 2022 financial year, 77 per cent. of visitors to our Attractions were domestic visitors and 23 per
cent. were international tourists, based on a survey of a sample of our visitors.

As of 1 April 2023, we operate in 24 countries globally, including 15 countries in Europe and North
America and nine countries in the Asia Pacific region, drawing both domestic and international visitors
in each location. In the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2023, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe
(excluding the United Kingdom), North America and the Asia Pacific region accounted for 29 per cent.,
23 per cent., 35 per cent. and 13 per cent. of our revenue, respectively.

Our Attractions range in format from city centre to destination resorts and coastal Attractions, capturing
both the urban and resort-based tourist market and appealing to visitors ranging from families with
young children to teenagers and adults. In addition, on site, themed accommodation has historically
improved guest satisfaction and contributed to our revenue growth. In the 53 weeks ended 31 December
2022, we generated 15 per cent. of our revenue from our accommodation offering (mainly through
overnight stays), 81 per cent. from our visitors (through admissions tickets, retail, food and beverage
sales and other commercial offerings at our Attractions) and 4 per cent. from other sources (mainly
including sponsorships and development contract revenues).

Our Attractions are also partially insulated against extreme weather or seasonal changes through a
mixture of formats, with 45 per cent. of our revenue having been derived from our LEGOLAND Parks
and 22 per cent. of our revenue having been derived from our Resort Theme Parks operations, both of
which are primarily organised around outdoor activities, and 33 per cent. of our revenue having been
derived from our Midway Attractions operating group, which is primarily organised around indoor
activities, in the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2023. In the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2023, 67 per cent. of our
revenue came from outdoor sites, and 33 per cent. from indoor sites. Most of our Attractions are
scheduled to remain open year-round, other than our European Theme Parks, LEGOLAND New York
and LEGOLAND Korea, which tend to be closed during the winter. In the 53 weeks ended 31 December
2022, 58 per cent. of our revenue came from sites that are open all year round.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had experienced a trend towards increased pre-booked revenues,
leading to reduced volatility in Attraction revenues. This trend continued in the 2022 financial year, as
the global economy recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic. In the 53 weeks ended 31 December
2022, 79 per cent. of total admissions revenue were generated prior to visitation from pre bookings or
annual passes, also resulting in a positive financial contribution to working capital. An increase in pre
bookings adds visibility to cash flows and provides resilience against external factors, such as the impact
of weather.

**_Consistent Financial Track Record with Flexible Cost Base_**

We have a strong financial track record as we recover from the impact of COVID-19, with reported
revenue recovering to £2,006 million in the 2022 financial year, reflecting a growth of 219.1 per cent.
between 2020 and 2022. We have also demonstrated an ability to rapidly recover and improve EBITDA
following periods of macroeconomic volatility, geo-political uncertainty and challenging trading
conditions within our operating groups (including, most recently, as a result of COVID-19). For
example, Adjusted EBITDA grew significantly between 2020 and 2022 from a loss of £102 million to
£692 million.

Our gross margins have been stable, supported by elevated revenue per capita, certain cost saving
initiatives and the outsourcing of certain food & beverage operations. In 2020, building on work that


-----

was already underway, we deployed structural cost saving measures to refine the operating model across
all Attractions, with the aim to create a lower fixed cost and more flexible cost base. Such measures
have partially offset ongoing inflationary headwinds. Staff expenses are the largest portion of costs and
we manage these dynamically by optimising our variable workforce, based on flexible agreements,
multi and cross skilling and rostering tools.

Our marketing spend was significantly reduced in 2020 and 2021 reflecting lower trading levels, but
started to return to more typical levels in 2022.

In addition, while energy contracts we renewed in the second half of 2022 and Q1 2023 have resulted
in significant price increases, utilities costs do not represent a significant portion of our cost base, and
amounted to 3 per cent. of revenues for the 2022 financial year.

**_Prudent Capital Allocation and Flexible Capital Expenditure Spend Resulting in Strong and_**
**_Recurring Cash Flow Generation_**

Our track record of delivering attractive returns from efficient investment is a result of a disciplined
internal focus on investment criteria, return thresholds and hurdles; in house expertise in capital
expenditure efficiency, project delivery, yield and variable cost management; and experience in
maximising the returns from marketing spend.

As part of our capital allocation strategy, we aim to maintain prudent investment practices throughout
our Existing Estate, by leveraging our strong brand portfolio. In addition, we are transforming our
Resort Theme Parks into short break destinations, by strengthening our short break proposition while
diversifying our product offering. We are also expanding our accommodation offering and Second Gate
Attractions footprint, to extend visitation time and increase revenue growth by unlocking cross-selling
opportunities. This has resulted in increases in accommodation revenue and pre-bookings, while
increasing our revenue and cash flow visibility and reduce volatility levels. We also believe that our
diverse offering of themed, on-site accommodation at our Resort Theme Parks further contributes to
the increase in revenues per capita, by enabling greater cross-selling opportunities. Further, our own inhouse Merlin Magic Making team delivers innovative new product ideas including ride concept and
design and wax figure manufacture, and therefore yields synergies and cost savings over third parties
that would otherwise be engaged to develop our Attractions. We also maximise our marketing spend
through targeted campaigns focused on educating prospective customers about new Attractions and
rides. Throughout this process, we take advantage of our market leverage and our scale to maximize
operational, marketing, product and cost synergies. In particular, we implement cost efficiencies such
as shared marketing costs, central management, site development expertise and application of visitor
management experiences across the portfolio. In addition to the benefits we derive from our core
competencies, we maintain our estate through regular planned maintenance capital expenditure, which
means that incremental capital expenditure can be targeted at driving incremental revenue opportunities.

In deploying our capital and planning our investments, we leverage strategic synergies across our three
operating groups, for example by developing “clusters” of Attractions in key locations, and through the
opening of on-site Second Gate attractions. A typical LEGOLAND Park generally requires lower
capital expenditure than a Resort Theme Park, because it is geared towards families with young children
and does not require expensive, large format roller coasters. Our Resort Theme Parks tend to be
nationally pre-eminent in their respective markets and therefore lack the significant competitive
intensity of the theme park operators in the United States. As a result, we do not need to compete solely
on the basis of the latest and largest coasters but can open significant new coasters on an opportunistic
basis. In addition, although not directly comparable to other theme park operators, a typical Midway
Attraction does not require substantial ongoing capital expenditure due to the lack of large scale
coasters, or rides, and the low overall degree of capital employed in each site. Capital expenditure
programmes for the Midway Attractions operating group vary between Attractions, depending on the
size and anticipated growth of the Attraction. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Capital Expenditure.” We believe we maintain an efficient_


-----

working capital profile, supported by a high proportion of admissions revenue (79 per cent. in 2022)
being generated prior to visitations from pre-bookings or annual passes.

Capital expenditure across our portfolio of Attractions is primarily funded out of our operating free cash
flow. Our total reported capital expenditure for the 2022 financial year was £195 million, of which £55
million was used for New Business Development, including new Attractions and new accommodations,
which included LEGOLAND Korea, and £140 million was used for our Existing Estate. We maintain
prudent investment practices throughout our Existing Estate, by leveraging our strong brand portfolio.
Our Existing Estate capital expenditure, which covers adding new rides and attractions, replace outdated
features and general maintenance activities, was 12 per cent., 6 per cent. and 7 per cent. of revenue in
the 2020, 2021 and 2022 financial years, respectively. Our successful and flexible capital expenditure
programme has translated into consistently positive cash conversion with operating free cash flow
conversion of 81 per cent. and 79 per cent. in the 2021 and 2022 financial years, respectively.

**_Highly Experienced and Diverse Management Team Backed by Equity Owners with In-depth_**
**_Knowledge of the Company_**

Our senior management team is highly experienced within both the attractions industry and our
businesses, with decades of combined sector experience, supplemented with relevant experience from
outside the attractions industry. See “Management.” Our Chief Executive Officer, Scott M. O’Neil was
appointed in November 2022. Scott has over 25 years of experience in leading and managing global
sports and entertainment brands. Our Chief Financial Officer, Alistair Windybank was appointed in
November 2020. He joined the Group in 2008 and has previously held various senior finance roles
within the Group including Head of Corporate Finance, Group Investor Relations Director, Senior
Finance Director Capital Projects and Deputy Chief Financial Officer. Our senior management team
drives the development and execution of our strategy to deliver growth both organically and through
acquisitions.

Our senior management team is supported by local management teams, which run our operating groups
and Attractions. Each Resort Theme Park, LEGOLAND Park and regional or functional division of the
Midway Attractions operating group has a divisional director, who is supported by a management team
and who reports directly to the relevant operating group managing director. This decentralised
management structure empowers site management to make commercial and operational decisions
locally, enabling real time reaction to local market conditions. Our senior management team is also
supported by the Merlin Magic Making team, which is our unique, creative and project management
resource. Merlin Magic Making also provides creative design and production. Our strong local
management teams are often a result of our culture of training and development, with central and local
programmes to develop skills at all levels of the organisation. The commitment of our employees is
best demonstrated by the results of the 2022 annual staff survey. More than 18,000 employees
completed the survey, a response rate of 84 per cent. Our employee engagement is one of our key
performance indicators measuring whether our teams think we are a “great place to perform,” “a great
_place for customers” and a “great place to work.” In 2022, our engagement was 68 per cent. favourable,_
an encouraging increase of 5 per cent. compared to 2021.

We also enjoy strong shareholder support and commitment, by highly experienced through-cycle
investors contributing substantial governance and oversight. Since 2019, we have been controlled by a
consortium of three principal long-term investors with the capability to support our growth ambitions.
These investors are KIRKBI, Blackstone and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP
Investments). Blackstone had previously been our majority shareholder since a management backed
buy out investment in 2005. At the same time, we acquired rights to LEGOLAND Parks from KIRKBI
A/S, who signed the licensing and co-operation agreement with us, and KIRKBI became one of our
shareholders. See “Business—History—Our Relationship with the KIRKBI Group.” Blackstone and
KIRKBI continued to jointly control Merlin for eight years from 2005 to 2013, during which period we
successfully grew, with a revenue CAGR of 12.5 per cent. from 2008 to 2013, to become the second
largest theme park operator globally by number of visitors in 2019. Blackstone has longstanding


-----

experience investing in the visitor attractions industry as well as the broader hospitality, travel and
leisure sectors. Blackstone’s previous investments include Merlin Entertainments, SeaWorld, Six Flags,
Universal Orlando, Center Parcs, Hilton Hotels and The Cosmopolitan Hotel.

**Our Strategy**

**_Existing Estate Growth Driven by Access to Powerful Intellectual Property_**

We believe in the growth of our Existing Estate, to strengthen our global position and improve our offer
to all our visitors. We continue to invest in our existing Attractions to grow demand, increase capacity
and to refresh and improve the visitor experience, which we believe is a key driver for increased visitor
numbers and revenue growth. We also aim to fully unlock the benefits of combining our brand
experience with the strength of our Attractions portfolio, and are driven by a constant focus to refresh
and retool our portfolio to maintain and expand our attractiveness. While we strive to improve our
product appeal, maintain our high levels of customer satisfaction and drive organic growth, we also
have developed prudent investment practices. Investments are planned well in advance, where possible,
according to the forecasted potential returns and the capital requirements of the respective Attraction,
operating groups and location. Existing Estate capital expenditure is divided between adding new rides
or displays and enhancements to our Attractions, replacing old features with newer, more compelling
ones and general maintenance, including ensuring health and safety standards are met or exceeded. Our
capital expenditure practices are designed to develop the product portfolio over time so as to increase
visitor numbers and visitors’ length of stay and to support value added increases in admissions fee prices
and commercial spend, thereby delivering growth in revenue and profitability.

We are increasingly able to develop these investments in partnership with leading intellectual property
owners to provide an immersive, themed experience for our visitors. For example, in 2022 we opened
a “JUMANJI — The Adventure” ride and, in 2023, a “JUMANJI: The Labyrinth” ride in our Gardaland
Theme Resort, as part of our multi-territory exclusivity agreement with Sony Pictures Entertainment, to
develop and operate attractions, rides, lands, retail outlets and themed hotel rooms based on the studio’s
“Jumanji” film franchise. In 2023, we have also opened a “World of Jumanji” themed land at our
Chessington Theme Park Resort, along with Jumanji-themed rooms at the local resort hotel, and plan
to open a Jumanji themed rollercoaster in 2023. In addition, in May 2022 we opened “LEGO Ferrari
_Build and Race” at our LEGOLAND California Resort. Featuring a life-size LEGO Ferrari F40 model,_
this interactive attraction aims offer visitors a full “in the driver’s seat” experience, by allowing to build,
test and race LEGO Ferrari models.

In addition to major rides and developments, we also make smaller investments at most Attractions to
support a continually refreshed marketing message and sustained level of visitor satisfaction such as the
Warner Bros. Icons of Horror attraction at Madame Tussauds New York or Rainforest Adventure at
SEA LIFE London Aquarium. We intend to continue maintaining the existing standards of general
maintenance and commitments to ensure health and safety standards and making strategic, value
accretive investments in our Existing Estate and in respect of New Business Development to maintain
and strengthen our leading positions in the industry in which we operate.

In addition, we aim to keep a committed workforce by remaining a great place to work, with high levels
of employee engagement. We believe our employee satisfaction is also driven by our rigid health, safety
and security programmes (based on our “Protecting the Magic” vision), our commitment towards the
environment and animal welfare and our strong focus on developing our front-line team (including
through career acceleration opportunities).

**_Evolution of Theme Parks to Destination Resorts_**

We aim to enhance our operational excellence, by unlocking value across our pricing, data and retail
strategies. We continue to transform our Theme Parks into destination resorts, extending visitor market
reach and enhancing revenues from a number of sales channels. These include primary admissions


-----

(including multi-day tickets and second gate admission fees), and commercial spend such as the sale of
food and beverages, retail merchandise, and souvenirs such as photos.

In addition, the themed accommodation offerings in our hotels and holiday villages continue to be very
successful. We believe these provide an integral contribution to the overall visitor experience, helping
to drive pre-bookings, increase multi-day ticket sales and improve guest satisfaction.

We are developing and plan to open in May 2024 a LEGOLAND Woodland Village, the UK’s first
LEGO themed holiday village, at LEGOLAND Windsor Resort. LEGOLAND Woodland Village will
feature 150 lodges, an on-site restaurant, and a family entertainment hub.

We also intend to benefit from ongoing opportunities to add new visitor attractions at our theme parks,
for which additional admission fees are charged. These attractions, such as waterparks, are referred to
as Second Gate attractions.

As of 1 April 2023, we offered a total of 5,342 rooms across our Theme Parks, including themed on-site
accommodation at all LEGOLAND Parks. In addition, our Heide Park, Warwick Castle and Alton
Towers resorts, along with our LEGOLAND Deutschland, LEGOLAND Billund, and LEGOLAND
Florida parks each include a holiday village, ranging from 65 to 367 rooms. We believe these hotels
and holiday villages provide an integral contribution to the overall customer experience, help drive
pre-booking, increase multi-day ticket sales and improve guest satisfaction. We believe that this
destination positioning has already extended visitor market reach to over five hours drive time and has
enhanced revenues from both primary admissions, including multi-day tickets and second gate
admission fees, and commercial spend. The latter is typically comprised of the sale of food and
beverages, merchandise and souvenirs as a result of longer average lengths of stay.

**_Clustering of Midway Attractions_**

Our growth strategy includes the opening of our chainable Midway attractions in new locations and
countries including key gateway cities, often creating ‘clusters’, where multiple attractions are
developed in one location. We have developed “clusters” of Midway Attractions in Amsterdam,
Arizona, Bangkok, Berlin, Birmingham, Blackpool, Dallas, Istanbul, Kansas City, London,
Manchester, Melbourne, Michigan, New Jersey, Oberhausen, Orlando, San Antonio, Shanghai, Sydney
and Tokyo, where multiple Attractions are situated in one city or region to capitalise on strong cross
promotional and operational synergies, including multi-attraction tickets to drive cross selling. For
example, in 2022, we opened a Peppa Pig World of Play Attraction in Leidschendam (the Netherlands),
a LEGO Discovery Centre in Brussels (Belgium) and have taken over the management contract of
Amsterdam’s THIS IS HOLLAND flying theatre experience, thereby expanding our local cluster of
attractions.

**_LEGOLAND Park Developments_**

We aim to fully unleash the potential of our LEGOLAND Parks footprint, leveraging on our proven
track record of developing and operating LEGOLAND Parks globally. We opened new LEGOLAND
Parks in Florida in 2011, in Malaysia in 2012, in Dubai in 2016, in Nagoya, Japan in 2017, in New York
in 2021 and in South Korea in 2022. LEGOLAND Malaysia and LEGOLAND Dubai are operated
under management contracts. In addition, we are also developing three LEGOLAND Parks in China in
cooperation with local partners. Each of LEGOLAND Sichuan resort, LEGOLAND Shanghai resort
and LEGOLAND Shenzhen resort is expected to open during or after 2025. All three will be operated
under a management contract model.

We have three operating and investment models with respect to the development of LEGOLAND Parks.

Firstly, in more proven locations, we follow an “owned and operated” model. Under this approach, we
make the necessary capital investment to secure the land and develop the infrastructure ourselves. We


-----

have used this model in our European and North American LEGOLAND Parks as well as for
LEGOLAND Korea (which has been developed under this model with support from local authorities).

Secondly, we work with a local partner, marrying their capabilities and expertise with our strengths and
experience to both parties’ mutual benefit. Typically, the funding for the capital investment is provided
by a third party and we operate the park under a management contract. We do not own the park but
instead operate it pursuant to a development and management contract with our partners. We operate
LEGOLAND Malaysia under this model. The Malaysian government provided the funds to develop
LEGOLAND Malaysia. We own a 20 per cent. interest in the company that owns LEGOLAND
Malaysia. LEGOLAND Dubai is operated under a similar management contract model, whereby LL
Dubai Theme Park LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of DXB Entertainments, owns the assets and we
operate the park. We do not have an equity interest in LEGOLAND Dubai but hold a 40 per cent.,
equity interest in LL Dubai Hotel LLC, the company that developed the hotel at LEGOLAND Dubai
(opened in 2022) and owns the hotel’s premises. See “Business—Material Contracts.”

Third, we can operate parks under a “leased and operated” model. Under this approach, the acquisition
of the park site, the development of the infrastructure and the basic construction is funded by a third
party partner. We fund and build the rides and the necessary theming, lease the site on a long-term basis,
and operate the LEGOLAND Park. LEGOLAND Japan, for example, was developed using this
approach with a subsidiary of KIRKBI as the lessor.

**_Acquisitions and New Format Opportunities_**

We continue to consider acquisitions of, or investments in, visitor attractions, sites and brands that could
strategically enhance our portfolio and enable us to grow into new geographies, and reallocate our
capital expenditure accordingly. Over the course of our operating history, we have demonstrated a track
record of identifying, implementing and integrating both large and small acquisitions and delivering
significant value uplift through improving acquired operations, while maintaining a standard level of
excellence across our estate. We believe that there remain further attractive acquisition opportunities
that would meet our investment criteria in the future.

In 2022 we completed the acquisition of the COEX Aquarium in Seoul, South Korea, adding a further
significant attraction to the SEA LIFE portfolio, and consistent with our wider strategy to build clusters
of Midway indoor attractions in key gateway cities.

In 2022, we also acquired the operations and brand licence of Cadbury World (a popular attraction in
the UK) pursuant to an exclusive partnership with Mondelēz International, thereby deepening our
relationship with a leading UK chocolate brand. As part of the agreement, we will be responsible for
the day-to-day running of the Cadbury World site, its employees, and all operational decisions, as well
as holding brand usage rights for Cadbury World in the UK. The Cadbury World attraction has been
added to our Midway Attractions portfolio.

We also develop new formats of attraction, where currently our focus is on Peppa Pig branded
attractions aimed at pre-school children. We have opened five pilot indoor Peppa Pig World of Play
attractions, and one standalone Peppa Pig theme park that opened next to LEGOLAND Florida Resort
in early 2022. We plan to open our second Peppa Pig theme park in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in 2024.

**Recent Developments**

**_Recent Trading_**

Our trading in April 2023 delivered continued year-on-year improvement, and we estimate that our total
revenue in the period from 2 April 2023 to 6 May 2023, was approximately 9% per cent. above the
equivalent period in 2022.

The preliminary results and estimates presented above have not been audited, are derived from internal
management accounts, are the responsibility of management and are subject to our financial closing
procedures. These procedures have not been completed. While we believe these preliminary results and
estimates to be reasonable, our actual results could vary from these estimates and these differences
could be material. As such, you should not place undue reliance on this information. This information
may not be indicative of any future period. See “Forward-Looking Statements,” “Risk Factors” and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this
Offering Memorandum for a more complete discussion of certain of the factors that could affect our
future performance and results of operations.

**_Potential Financing Transactions_**

We continually evaluate different financing alternatives and may decide to enter into new credit
facilities, access the debt capital markets (including by tapping the Notes offered hereby) or incur other
indebtedness or enter into liability management transactions from time to time, including following the
pricing of this Offering and prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue Date (the
“Potential Financing Transactions”). The cash proceeds of any Potential Financing Transactions may
be used to refinance indebtedness or for general corporate purposes. The issuance of indebtedness under
any such Potential Financing Transactions would be incurred in compliance with the applicable
covenants under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Existing 2026 Indenture, the Existing Senior
Notes Indenture and the Indenture. Any Potential Financing Transaction will be made at our election or
the election of our relevant subsidiaries, and, if such debt is in the form of securities, such debt would
be offered and sold pursuant to, and on the terms described in, a separate offering memorandum or
liability management document. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Structure—
_We may incur additional indebtedness prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue Date_
_of the Notes, which indebtedness could increase our leverage and may have terms that are more or less_
_favourable than the terms of the Notes and our other existing indebtedness.”_

**The Issuer**

The Issuer is a private limited liability company (société à responsabilité limitée) incorporated under
the laws of Luxembourg and registered with the Luxembourg Trade and Companies Register with
registration number B234977. The address of its registered office is 2 4 rue Eugène Ruppert, L 2453
Luxembourg. The Issuer has no material assets, other than derivative assets to hedge certain interest
rate exposures arising from debt issued by the Issuer, equity interests in, and/or intercompany balances
with, other subsidiaries or affiliates of the Group. The Issuer has no revenue generating activities of its

**SUMMARY CORPORATE AND FINANCING STRUCTURE**

_The following diagram gives a simplified summary of our corporate structure and principal_
_indebtedness, on a pro forma basis giving effect to the Offering. Please see “The Offering” and “Use_
_of Proceeds.” The diagram does not include all entities within our group, or all of the debt obligations_
_thereof. For additional information, see “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalisation.” For a summary of_
_the debt obligations referred to in this chart, see “Capitalisation,” “Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements” and “Description of Notes.”_

________________________________________

(1) The Consortium indirectly controls (through wholly owned intermediate holding companies) MAL, with Blackstone indirectly holding

approximately 31.99 per cent., CPP Investments indirectly holding approximately 15.50 per cent. and KIRKBI indirectly owning 47.59
per cent. of share capital in JVco. In addition, approximately 5 per cent. is indirectly held by The Wellcome Trust.

(2) JVco, Topco and Midco were incorporated as holding companies for the purpose of the Acquisition and the Senior Notes Issuer was

incorporated for purposes of issuing the Existing Senior Notes in connection with the financing of the Acquisition. None of these
companies have independent business operations, or have any significant assets (except, in the case of the Senior Notes Issuer and Midco
their interests in certain intercompany loans), other than the equity interest each of these companies holds in its subsidiaries. The
restrictive covenants in the Indenture will only apply to MAL and its subsidiaries. In 2021, we introduced our Management Incentive
Plans, which allowed eligible employees to invest in the Group on customary terms and conditions. Pursuant to the Management Share
Incentive Plans, we issued preference shares and ordinary shares in our subsidiary Topco to senior management in exchange for
consideration. See “Management—Management Share Incentive Plans.”

(3) The Issuer is offering €650.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its % senior secured notes due 2030. On or about the Issue

Date, the proceeds of the Offering will be used, together with cash on balance sheet: (i) to redeem the Issuer’s €500 million Senior
Secured Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”), including paying the redemption premium thereon and accrued and unpaid interest to the
date of the redemption (the “Refinancing” and together with the Offering, the “Transactions”), (ii) maintain cash on balance sheet to
repay, redeem, repurchase (including from the open-market) or address maturities of, our other secured indebtedness, and (iii) to pay the
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions. See “Use of Proceeds.”

(4) The Notes will be general obligations of the Issuer and will, upon issuance, (i) rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s

existing and future obligations that are not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the Issuer’s guarantee of the Existing
2026 Notes and its obligations under the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations, (ii) rank senior in right of payment to all
existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the Issuer’s
obligations under its guarantee of the Existing Senior Notes, (iii) be effectively subordinated to all future obligations of the Issuer that
are secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such
obligations, (iv) be structurally subordinated to all obligations of MAL’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes (other than the
Issuer), (v) be guaranteed on a senior basis by MAL and the Subsidiary Guarantors, subject to limitations under applicable law, and (vi)
be secured as set forth under “Description of Notes—Security.”

obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor (including such Subsidiary Guarantor’s obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement,
certain hedging obligations and obligations under the Existing 2026 Notes), (ii) rank senior in right of payment with all existing and
future obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor that are expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Subsidiary Guarantor’s
Guarantee, including such Subsidiary Guarantor’s obligations under its guarantee of the Existing Senior Notes (iii) be effectively
subordinated to all existing and future secured obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor that are secured by property and assets that do

_Security.” The security interests in favour of the Notes and the Guarantees may be released under certain circumstances._

(7) In connection with the financing for the Acquisition, the Issuer and the U.S. Co Borrower entered into the Senior Facilities Agreement.

In addition to certain term loan facilities, the Senior Facilities provide for borrowings of up to £400 million (equivalent) under the
Revolving Facility. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Revolving Facility was undrawn by way of cash loans while £30
million has been utilized by way of certain ancillary facilities, including letters of credit. See “Capitalisation” and “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement.”_

(8) On 9 May 2018, MEL issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 5[3]/4% Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Existing 2026 Notes”)

pursuant to the Existing 2026 Indenture. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing 2026 Notes.” Security interests

(*) In 2021, we restated our consolidated income statement and our consolidated statement of financial position for the 2020 financial year
to give effect to (i) a change in accounting policy relating to software-as-a-service (SaaS) arrangements and (ii) the correction of certain

(1) EBITDA is defined as profit before finance income and costs, taxation, depreciation, amortisation and impairment and is after taking

account of attributable profit after tax of jointly controlled entities. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as profit before finance income and
costs, taxation, depreciation, amortisation and impairment, share-based payments under the Management Share Incentive Plans and
exceptional items and is after taking account of attributable profit after tax of joint controlled entities. Adjusted EBITDA (pre-IFRS 16),
as used in this Offering Memorandum, represents Adjusted EBITDA less adjustments made to exclude the impact of the application of
IFRS 16 to Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (pre-IFRS 16) do not reflect any weighted foreign
exchange rate adjustments.

These adjustments are based upon various assumptions, forecasts and management estimates and are in part based upon historical
information. This information does not represent the results we would have achieved had each of the adjustments occurred and been
fully implemented on the first day of the relevant financial period. These numbers have not been, and cannot be, audited, reviewed or
verified by an independent accounting firm. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not be comparable
to our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this Offering Memorandum and should not be
relied upon when making an investment decision. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (pre-IFRS 16) are included in
this Offering Memorandum because we believe they are helpful to investors as measures of our operating performance and ability to
service our debt. These measures are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation
or as an alternative to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in
accordance with IFRS. Other companies, including those in our industry, may calculate similarly titled financial measures differently
from us, and so the presentation of such financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
See “Presentation of Financial Information.” Funds depicted by certain of these measures may not be available for management’s
discretionary use due to covenant restrictions, debt service payments or other commitments.

(a) In 2021, we restated our consolidated income statement for the 2020 financial year to give effect to (i) a change in
accounting policy relating to software-as-a-service (SaaS) arrangements and (ii) the correction of certain errors that
were identified during 2021. For further information, see “Presentation of Financial Information—Historical Financial
_Statements—Restated Financial Statements.”_

(b) Exceptional items in the 2020 financial year represent: (a) one-time costs in the amount of £20 million incurred in
connection with productivity and efficiency activities, mainly driven by changes made to our organizational structures
in attractions and support functions (primarily as a consequence to the COVID-19 pandemic), by the completion of
long-term productivity initiatives commenced in prior periods, and by the change in accounting policy relating to the
capitalisation of certain software assets (which has driven an increase in exceptional operating expenses relating to
productivity and efficiency activities in the amount of £5 million in the 2020 financial year), and (b) one-time costs of
£2 million primarily representing professional and advisor fees incurred with the Acquisition. Exceptional items in the
2021 financial year represent: (a) one-time operational costs in the amount of £1 million incurred in the 2021 financial
year in relation to productivity and efficiency related activities commenced in the 2020 financial year, (b) in increase
by £3 million in exceptional operating expenses relating to productivity and efficiency activities, driven by the change
in accounting policy relating to the capitalisation of certain software assets, and (c) the one-time release of £1 million
of provisions, due to the finalisation of costs relating to transactions recorded in prior periods. No exceptional items
were recorded in the 2022 financial year. For further information, see “Presentation of Financial Information—
_Historical Financial Statements—Restated Financial Statements.”_

(c) Share-based payments represent share-based non-cash compensation expenses incurred as a result of the Group’s
Management Share Incentive Plans implemented in 2021. See “Management—Management Share Incentive Plans.”

(a) Lease accounting adjustment represents adjustments made to exclude the impact of the application of IFRS 16 from
EBITDA.

(b) Represents decrease/increase in working capital plus changes in provisions and other non-current liabilities.

(7) Pro forma cash and cash equivalents represent cash and cash equivalents of JVco and its subsidiaries as of 1 April 2023, as adjusted to

give effect to the Transactions, as if the Transactions occurred on 1 April 2023. JVco and its subsidiaries had cash and cash equivalents
of £189 million as of 1 April 2023. Giving effect to the Transactions, JVco and its consolidated subsidiaries would have had cash and
cash equivalents of £302 million as of 1 April 2023. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.”

(8) Pro forma net senior secured indebtedness (excluding leases) represents total senior secured indebtedness of JVco and its subsidiaries,

as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, as if the Transactions occurred on 1 April 2023, less pro forma cash and cash equivalents
of JVco and its subsidiaries. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.” Pro forma net senior secured indebtedness (excluding leases)
does not reflect any weighted foreign exchange rate adjustments.

(9) Pro forma net indebtedness (excluding leases) represents total indebtedness (excluding leases) of JVco and its subsidiaries, as adjusted

to give effect to the Transactions, as if the Transactions occurred on 1 April 2023, less pro forma cash and cash equivalents of JVco and
its subsidiaries. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalisation.” Pro forma net indebtedness (excluding leases) does not reflect any weighted
foreign exchange rate adjustments.

(10) Pro forma cash interest expense (excluding leases) represents estimated cash interest expense (excluding leases) of JVco and its

subsidiaries, for the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2023, as adjusted to give effect to the Transactions, as if these occurred on 27 March 2022.
See “Use _of Proceeds” and “Capitalisation.” For purposes of calculating pro forma cash interest expense, interest on the Notes, the_
Existing Senior Notes, the Existing 2026 Notes, the Revolving Facility, the EUR Term Loan B and the USD Term Loan B have been


-----

converted to pounds sterling at an exchange rate of $1.2309 to £1.00 or €1.1368 to £1.00, as applicable, which were the exchange rates
at the close of trading on 1 April 2023. Pro forma cash interest expense (excluding leases) also includes interest income on cash and
existing interest rate hedging in place, has been presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what our cash
interest expense (excluding leases) would have actually been had the Transactions occurred on the date assumed, nor does it purport to
project our cash interest expenses (excluding leases) for any period or our financial condition on any future date. For illustrative purposes
and assuming the same basis of calculation, our pro forma cash interest expense would be reduced by in the event the £132 million
of proceeds of the Offering put on our balance sheet to repay, redeem, repurchase (including from the open-market) or address maturities
of, our other secured indebtedness, was used to repay amounts outstanding under our EUR Term Loan B (further adjusted to include the
offsetting impact of lower cash interest income).

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves risks. Before investing in the Notes, you should consider carefully_
_the following risk factors and all information contained in this Offering Memorandum. Additional risks_
_and uncertainties of which we are not aware or that we believe are immaterial may also adversely affect_
_our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or prospects. If any of these events_
_occur, our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or prospects could be materially_
_and adversely affected, we may not be able to pay interest or principal on the Notes when due and you_
_could lose all or part of your investment._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and_
_uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking_
_statements as a result of various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this_
_Offering Memorandum._

**Risks Related to Our Market and Our Business**

**_Economic conditions beyond our control could have an adverse effect on our results of operations._**

Our business is influenced by general economic trends. We maintain a highly diversified portfolio of
attractions across geography, attraction type, brand and customer demographic and well as between
indoor and outdoor Attractions, which appeals to both international and domestic visitors. While we
believe that this degree of diversification allows a resilient performance, discretionary consumer
spending, which is the principal economic driver for visitor attendance at our Attractions, is affected by
global economic conditions. In addition, our performance is subject to change as consumer preferences
and behaviour evolve in the current macro-economic environment. Visitor volumes at the Attractions,
and the amount that visitors spend at the Attractions when they visit, may decrease if relative disposable
income decreases, unemployment increases or the spending habits of potential visitors change to reflect
any increased uncertainty or apprehension regarding economic conditions. While we believe that we
benefit from short-breaks and day trips, as consumers swap longer and more expensive holidays
overseas for domestic leisure pursuits, a significant deterioration or sustained decline in economic
conditions could reduce spending at our Attractions or prolong a period of no spending, and if the
current economic conditions continue or worsen in any of the markets in which we operate, even
markets with a higher degree of domestic visitation, there can be no assurance that this will not have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The global economy experienced one of its sharpest downturns in history as a result of the outbreak of
the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the related lockdowns and restrictions on activity. Although some
economies experienced a strong rebound in 2021 as restrictions eased, there is a material risk of a global
recession coupled with high inflation. While we benefit from a structurally positive working capital
cycle, with upfront payment for services and an ability to switch off capital investment to preserve cash
for operations, our business also gives rise to market risk exposure related to changes in inflation, global
commodity prices, energy prices and other indirect factors such as our supply chain. We experienced
an impact below the level of overall energy prices in 2022 due to a combination of forward contracts
and government support packages. While we maintain procurement processes allowing us to build a
hedged forward position for our energy requirements, our contracts renewing in 2022 and 2023 have
resulted in significant price increases while government support packages have largely been removed,
which may drive a significant increase in our energy costs compared to our long-term historic average.

To counter inflation, central banks have started increasing interest rates and they may continue to
increase interest rates. Policy tightening in the UK and markets across the world has already begun in
order to counteract rising inflation. If our costs continue to be impacted by significant inflationary
pressures or interest rate increases, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price
increases. The impact of the military conflict in Ukraine has contributed to this and could cause
sustained inflationary pressures and general economic uncertainty and it is not possible to predict its


-----

duration or future effect on the world economy, the UK economy, the financial markets, our supply
chains, our costs or consumer confidence in general. In addition, an extended period of increased
commodity prices could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If
we are not able to effectively mitigate such risks, it could have a negative impact on our results of
operations.

Global economic conditions may also be impacted by continued adverse developments in the banking
and financial services industry. In March 2023, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank were closed
by regulators in the United States following liquidity concerns. In Europe, Credit Suisse came close to
a collapse in March 2023, which led to UBS agreeing to acquire its business, following the intervention
of Swiss regulatory authorities. The pressure on U.S. regional banks has continued, leading to the
announcement by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on May 1, 2023, that First Republic Bank,
a California based regional bank, would be taken over by JPMorgan Chase. While we have no material
exposure to these institutions, there is no guarantee that other financial institutions will not experience
similar liquidity issues in the near future, or that actions taken by government authorities to mitigate
these risks will be sufficient to ensure access to our cash deposits held at financial institutions and
sources of liquidity. In addition, there can be no assurance that there will not be additional bank failures
or issues in the broader financial system, which may have an impact on the broader capital markets and,
in turn, our ability to access those markets.

Moreover, if any parties with whom we conduct business are unable to access funds pursuant to lending
arrangements with a closed financial institution, such parties’ ability to pay their obligations to us or to
enter into new commercial arrangements requiring additional payments to us could be adversely
affected. As a result, a failure of one or more financial institutions with which we do business could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_We may be adversely affected by terrorist activities, political direct action, activism, natural disasters_**
**_and significant power outages._**

Actual, attempted and threatened terrorist, sabotage and other criminal activities (such as trespass and
other direct action by politically motivated groups) as well as natural disasters and significant power
outages may adversely affect visitor volumes and spending at Attractions, delay or cause the
abandonment of the development or expansion of Attractions or cause the voluntary, temporary or
permanent cessation of operations of one or a number of the Attractions, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have Attractions in
cities and in countries that have experienced terrorist attacks and public shooting incidents in recent
years, such as London, New York, Manchester, Istanbul, Orlando, Munich, Berlin, Bangkok and Paris.
The perceived threat of terrorist activity could in itself cause a downturn in visitor numbers and
spending at our Attractions, particularly at Attractions located in city centres.

In the event of any terrorist or other disruptive activity successfully targeting or otherwise impacting,
or a natural disaster or significant power outage impacting, an Attraction, there can be no assurance that
we would seek to or receive approval to rebuild, restore or otherwise repair any damage to the
Attraction, or that visitor volumes could be restored to levels experienced prior to the occurrence of
such event. While we have insurance cover designed to mitigate the financial impact of direct terrorist
or other disruptive activities or natural disasters or power outages on our operations, such insurance
cover is subject to exclusions, exceptions, deductibles and limits on liability which mean that we may
not be reimbursed in whole or in part for any resulting loss. Terrorist or other disruptive activity could
also impact the transport infrastructure that serves our Attractions and in doing so affect the ability of
staff or visitors to travel to our Attractions with consequent impact on visitor volumes.

We operate a number of clusters of Midway Attractions and other Attractions in or near “gateway” city
centres. Any actual, attempted or threatened terrorist or other disruptive activity targeting a location
where we operate a cluster of Midway Attractions could have a disproportionately negative effect on
visitor numbers and our business, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

In addition, we operate a number of aquariums and other animal attractions, including 47 SEA LIFE
Attractions, as of 1 April 2023. Despite our involvement with various conservation charities, certain
animal rights activists are known to campaign against such operations. If we were to become the subject
of any such campaigns, this could impact public opinion about or interfere with our operations and
consequently reduce visitor volumes at the Attractions. Any significant reduction in visitor volumes
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In order to maintain appropriate water temperatures in our tanks, our SEA LIFE Centres have back-up
generators to provide power in the event of short-term power failure. In the event generators fail or
power outages persist for a prolonged period of time, there is a potential risk of loss or damage to stock
and a consequent impact on displays at Attractions, which could be detrimental to customer satisfaction,
result in temporary closure of displays or Attractions and have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are exposed to the risk of serious accidents and other safety incidents._**

Our brand and our reputation are amongst our most important assets. Our ability to attract and retain
customers depends, in part, upon the external perceptions of our business, the quality and safety of our
parks, services and rides and our corporate and management integrity. Our Attractions involve the
inherent risk that serious incidents may occur where guests, staff members or contractors are harmed,
including as a result of: a failure to follow safety management systems when operating rides; inadequate
maintenance and management of buildings, infrastructure and vegetation; substandard build quality,
asset degradation, fire flood, storm or utility failure; harmful actions or crimes committed by other
guests; or contagious disease outbreaks. An accident, an injury or an outbreak at any of our parks or at
parks operated by competitors, particularly an accident or injury involving the safety of guests and
employees, that receives media attention, could negatively impact our brand or reputation, cause loss
of consumer confidence in our company, reduce attendance at our parks, and negatively impact our
results of operations. The considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years could
compound the impact of negative publicity. If any such incident occurs during a time of high seasonal
demand, the effect could disproportionately impact our results of operations for the year.

Despite the health and safety measures that we have imposed, incidents involving harm to persons at
certain of the Attractions, including a limited number of incidents involving serious bodily injury and
loss of life, as well as damage to property and assets have occurred. For instance, we had an accident at
our Alton Towers Resort in 2015, in which two carriages on one of our rides collided and 16 passengers
were injured. In 2022 we also had an accident at our LEGOLAND Germany resort, in which two
rollercoaster trains collided and 34 passengers were injured. See “Business—Health, Safety and
_Security—The LEGOLAND Germany Accident.” Although we have implemented changes to reduce the_
likelihood of such events happening again, there can be no assurance that other similar events will not
occur in the future. In addition, we are exposed to the risk of other safety incidents at our Theme Parks,
including social disturbances and health concerns such as instances of food borne illnesses at our
restaurants, water borne illnesses on our water rides and air borne illnesses at any of the Attractions.
Instances or reports, whether verified or not, of food safety issues, such as food borne illnesses
(including allergic reactions by customers), food tampering, food contamination or mislabelling may
significantly damage our reputation and expose us to litigation claims. Any accident or other safety
incident involving loss of life or harm to any persons or damage to property or assets (or the public
perception of risk thereof) could expose us to financial risk, including personal injury and other liability
claims and criminal proceedings. Internal investigations or investigations by insurers or other interested
parties following an accident or other incident involving a ride or Attraction could cause the affected
ride or Attraction to be closed for a period of time or indefinitely which could negatively impact our
brands, reputation and visitor volumes. In addition, rides (including high profile rides) at our Theme
Parks could be subject to stoppages as a result of mechanical or technical faults. The occurrence of any
such accident, other safety incident or material stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. The Medical Treatment Case (“MTC”) rate
captures the rate of guest injuries requiring external medical treatment relative to 10,000 guest


-----

visitations. Our MTC rate on a rolling basis in the 2022 financial year was 0.01, having remained
constant at 0.02 in the 2020 and 2021 financial years.

In addition, accidents or other safety incidents at Attractions we operate or at our competitors’
attractions (for example, historic incidents involving marine animals at one of our competitors, the
fatality of a visitor at the Drayton Manor theme park in 2017 and the collapse of the Berlin aquadrome
in 2022) may generate adverse media coverage of us or the visitor attractions industry generally, result
in regulatory changes that affect our industry and may adversely affect the general attitudes of potential
visitors towards us and our brands. For example, the accident at Drayton Manor resulted in a temporary
shutdown of similar rides in our parks while we reviewed our safety policies and procedures. Any such
event could adversely affect visitor volumes at the Attractions which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may be adversely affected by unfavourable weather conditions._**

In the 2022 financial year, 46 per cent. of our revenue was derived from our LEGOLAND Parks and
22 per cent. of our revenue was derived from our Resort Theme Parks operations, which are primarily
organised around outdoor activities. Accordingly, visitor volumes at the LEGOLAND Parks and Resort
Theme Parks can be significantly negatively affected by excessive rain or heat, other inclement weather
and forecasts of inclement weather. Moreover, since our Resort Theme Parks are located entirely in
Western Europe, we are exposed to the risk that any single inclement weather pattern that affects the
whole region could have a significant adverse effect on the Resort Theme Parks operating group.

In the 2022 financial year, 32 per cent. of our revenue was derived from our Midway Attractions
operating group, which is primarily organised around indoor activities. Accordingly, visitor volumes at
the Midway Attractions can be negatively affected by unusually hot weather and forecasts of unusually
hot weather, particularly during the summer months when our customers would rather, for example,
partake in outdoor activities.

Furthermore, due to the seasonal nature of our business, inclement weather during July and August, the
peak months of our opening period, and other peak periods across the globe (for example, the Easter
and October half term school holiday periods in the United Kingdom), can have a greater negative
impact on visitor volumes at the LEGOLAND Parks and Resort Theme Parks than inclement weather
at other times. In addition, because weekend days are typically peak days for visitor volumes at the
Attractions, unusually hot weather on weekends can have a greater negative impact on visitor volumes
at Midway Attractions than on weekdays and inclement weather on weekends can have a greater
negative impact on visitor volumes at the LEGOLAND Parks and Resort Theme Parks than on
weekdays. Our recently opened LEGOLAND New York and LEGOLAND Korea operate seasonally,
closing over parts of the winter period.

Due to the varying nature and locations of the Attractions, weather conditions resulting in reduced
visitor numbers at the outdoor Attractions may not always result in a corresponding increase in the
number of visitors at the indoor Attractions, and vice versa.

A significant reduction in visitor volumes at the Attractions due to unfavourable weather conditions
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Increased costs of labour, work stoppages and other labour problems, and the seasonal nature of our_**
**_workforce may negatively impact our results of operations._**

Labour is a primary component of our operating costs with staff costs (including share-based payments
under our Management Share Incentive Plans), and excluding exceptional items, representing 27 per
cent. of revenues in the 2022 financial year, compared to 30 per cent. in the 2021 financial year. Like
other businesses in the leisure and hospitality sector, we have seen and continue to see employment cost


-----

pressures, with increases in minimum wage levels and tight labour markets combined with high vacancy
levels.

Further increases in labour costs for any reason, including due to competition, increased minimum
wage, employee benefit costs, medical benefits costs or otherwise could adversely impact our business
results, financial condition and results of operations. Further, a small number of our employees belong
to trade unions. Though the level of our employees’ participation in strikes organised by trade unions
has been, in general, very low, we are exposed to potential future labour issues. A strike or other work
stoppage at our Attractions could have an adverse effect on our business.

Our Attractions are dependent in part on a seasonal workforce. We manage seasonal wages and the
timing of the hiring process to attempt to secure the appropriate workforce for peak and low seasons.
We cannot guarantee that material increases in the cost of securing our seasonal workforce will not
occur in the future. Increased seasonal wages, employment costs or an inadequate workforce could have
an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_If we are required to make unexpected payments to any pension plans applicable to our employees,_**
**_or to cover plan funding shortfalls, our financial condition may be adversely affected._**

We operate a number of defined contribution pension schemes as well as a closed defined benefit
scheme for certain former UK employees of The Tussauds Group, which was acquired in 2007, and a
closed defined benefit scheme for certain employees of Gardaland Resort in Italy. Our cash flows may
be negatively impacted to the extent we are required to make any additional payments to any relevant
defined benefit pension plans in excess of the amounts assumed in our current projections and
assumptions or report higher pension plan expenses under relevant accounting rules.

Moreover, in certain jurisdictions, pension regulators and authorities may be granted extensive powers
that may be exercised in connection with the completion of certain transactions. For example, the UK
Pensions Regulator has powers to impose contributions to a UK defined benefit pension scheme, or to
put in place arrangements for the financial support of the pension scheme, including, but not limited to,
requirements to provide additional security in support of such scheme. The new UK Pension Schemes
Act 2021, which came into force in October 2021, may also significantly impact future corporate
activity of entities with a UK defined benefit pension scheme. The new legislation provides for new
criminal offences targeting “risking accrued scheme benefits” and the “avoidance of employer debt”,
which may be interpreted as to include ordinary corporate activity in certain circumstances. Moreover,
the new legislation introduces wider powers for the UK Pensions Regulator to intervene in corporate
activity (including acquisitions and internal restructurings), and new requirements to give advance
notification of certain corporate activity and to provide statements to the UK Pensions Regulator, which
may require the input of the pension scheme trustee, with regard to the expected impact of such activity
on the pension scheme. For further information on the net pension surplus position of the schemes
entered into by the Group see note 6.2 to the audited consolidated financial statements for the 2022
financial year, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

Any future changes to, or strengthening of, pension legislation or regulations (particularly the regulatory
funding regime), could increase requirements for cash funding, demanding more financial resources to
meet governmentally mandated pension requirements. Future contributions to our defined benefit
pension plans could therefore reduce the cash otherwise available to operate our business and could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

**_We may be adversely affected by public health concerns._**

The worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 and the consequent containment measures implemented
by governments and public authorities had an enormous social impact and a significant impact on
general economic performance and on consumption and investments. The COVID-19 pandemic
significantly impacted the global economy and strained the entertainment industry due to travel


-----

restrictions and stay-at-home directives in place at various times during 2020 and 2021, resulting in
widespread disruptions and significantly reduced travel around the world. The reduction in travel
resulted in the complete and partial suspensions of our operations in many of the areas where our
Attractions are located, including the closure of an overwhelming majority of our Attractions for
protracted periods of time in 2020 and in 2021. As such, the COVID-19 pandemic had a material impact
on our results for the 2020 and 2021 financial years.

The outbreak of a prolonged pandemic or epidemic disease, similar to COVID-19 as well as
H1N1/swine flu, H5N1/bird flu and Zika virus in the past, or the occurrence of any other public health
concern could negatively impact the public’s willingness to gather in public spaces or travel
domestically or overseas or result in health or other government authorities imposing restrictions on
travel, any of which individually or together could reduce visitor volumes or revenues at the Attractions.
In addition, any such public health concerns may severely restrict the level of economic activity in
affected areas. Any of these events, particularly if they occur during July or August, when our visitor
volumes are typically highest, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_We may not generate the desired returns from our development of LEGOLAND Parks, new resort_**
**_hotels and Midway Attractions._**

A key component of our strategy is developing our LEGOLAND Parks, new resort hotels and Midway
Attractions. In 2021, we opened LEGOLAND New York and eight Midway Attractions, which included
two in New Jersey, USA, as part of our clustering strategy to open multiple attractions in one location.
Also in 2021, we opened a new hotel at LEGOLAND New York as part of our strategy to transform
our Theme Parks into destination resorts. In 2022, we opened LEGOLAND Korea, a Peppa Pig Theme
park in close proximity to our LEGOLAND Florida resort, two Midway Attractions in Continental
Europe and acquired a further two Midway Attractions, notably THIS IS HOLLAND in the Netherlands
and the COEX aquarium in South Korea. Also in 2022, we opened our LEGOLAND Dubai Hotel.

We plan to continue growing our LEGOLAND resorts footprint with three LEGOLAND Parks in
development in China, which we plan to open during or after 2025. Although we have identified sites
for the potential roll-out of Midway Attractions, new hotels and LEGOLAND Parks during upcoming
financial years, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue successfully to identify and
secure suitable roll-out locations for new site openings and accommodation projects each year or
successfully execute such projects.

New Midway Attractions, new resort hotels and other accommodation and additional LEGOLAND
Parks may fail to become operational on the scheduled timetable or fail to open due to setbacks caused
by: planning delays, challenges or refusals; development requests from local authorities over and above
the norm; infrastructure issues; construction delays; financing delays; the delay or our inability, for any
reason, to recruit, manage and control appropriately skilled employees and consultants; the financial
failure of any key suppliers, development partners or finance providers; or otherwise. Furthermore, once
opened, our LEGOLAND parks (including any related resort hotels and other accommodation) and our
Midway Attractions may not attract anticipated volumes of visitors or guests, either in the short or
long-term. In addition, we rely in some instances on independent contractors and sub-contractors for
services relating to the development and construction of our Attractions and the provision of certain
amenities and services to our customers once an Attraction has opened. There can be no assurance that
we will be able to engage appropriate third parties and if engaged, that they will provide the services in
a satisfactory and timely manner.

The occurrence of any of these factors could negatively impact our ability to generate the desired returns
from our development of LEGOLAND Parks, resort hotels and other accommodation and Midway
Attractions.


-----

**_We may not generate the desired returns from the investment in our Existing Estate._**

Our growth strategy is dependent in part upon regular investments in our Existing Estate that are
intended to increase visitor volumes, support price increases and drive revenue growth at our existing
Attractions, as well as maintain the long-term attractiveness of the Attractions. Such investments
include: installing new rides and Attractions; replacing old Attractions with newer Attractions;
upgrading and/or re theming existing Attractions; and the general maintenance of existing Attractions
(including ensuring health and safety standards continue to be met). See “Management’s Discussion
_and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting our Results of_
_Operation—Management of Capital Investments—Existing Estate.” In the past, in some circumstances,_
investments have not yielded the anticipated increase in visitor volumes and revenues and there can be
no assurance that our future planned investments will result in revenue growth at levels we anticipated
(or at all), or that, if revenues do increase, the additional revenues will be sufficient to recover the
amounts we invested and provide a return on such investments.

Any investment that does not result in increased visitor volumes, that otherwise does not recover the
amount we have invested or that does not maintain the long-term attractiveness of the relevant
Attraction, could adversely affect revenues at the relevant Attraction and consequently have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We rely on key personnel and on our ability to attract and retain employees._**

We rely on the contributions of our senior management team and other key personnel for the successful
management and operation of our business. In addition, our future success depends in part on our ability
to continue to recruit, train, motivate and retain employees and on our ability to continue to employ
creative employees and consultants. In addition, our ability to expand into new geographies is dependent
in part on our ability to recruit, manage and retain employees in those locations. The loss of service of
any of our senior management team or other key personnel, or our inability to attract, retain and
appropriately manage new employees or qualified employees and consultants, including in connection
with the Acquisition, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_Our use of the LEGOLAND and LEGO trademarks, content and other intellectual property rights_**
**_are subject to the terms and conditions of the LCA._**

We have the right to use the LEGOLAND and LEGO trademarks in the LEGOLAND Parks and
LEGO/LEGOLAND Discovery Centres on an exclusive worldwide basis until at least 2075, pursuant
to the LCA with KIRKBI A/S, the parent company of KIRKBI, which holds 47.49 per cent. of the
shares in JVco.

The extension of the term of the LCA is subject to the development of a certain number of LEGOLAND
Parks or LEGO/LEGOLAND Discovery Centres, which we may not be able to develop in a timely
manner or at all due to cost pressures given the scale and complexity of the Attractions or other factors,
including those beyond our control. The LCA is subject to termination rights of the parties thereto in
specified circumstances, including rights of KIRKBI A/S to terminate licensing to a park if visitor
satisfaction survey results fall below a specified level, subject to specified cure periods. In addition, we
may lose exclusivity if we fail to expand the number of LEGOLAND venues worldwide in accordance
with the agreement. If the visitor satisfaction survey results fall below the threshold enabling KIRKBI
A/S to terminate licensing under the LCA and such results are not cured in accordance with the LCA,
there can be no assurances that KIRKBI A/S would not terminate or require amendments to the LCA
with terms that may be less favourable to us than the current agreement. In connection with the
Acquisition, the Consortium has agreed on certain changes to the licensing arrangements under the
LCA, which are in process of being implemented as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. See
“Business—Material Contracts—Intellectual Property.”


-----

Any loss of our rights to use the LEGOLAND and LEGO trademarks in relation to all or any of the
LEGOLAND Parks or LEGO/LEGOLAND Discovery Centres could require us to direct significant
levels of capital expenditure to removing the LEGOLAND and LEGO trademarks and LEGO based
statues, rides and other content from the relevant LEGOLAND Parks and/or LEGO/LEGOLAND
Discovery Centres and to introducing new trademarks and theming to, and marketing of, such
Attractions. In addition, the loss of the benefit of association with these trademarks and the operational
disruption could have a significant negative effect on visitor volumes which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The loss of the rights to
use the trademarks could also delay completion of or cause the abandonment of any LEGOLAND Parks
and LEGO/LEGOLAND Discovery Centres under development which could restrict our ability to
pursue our growth strategy. The termination of the LCA could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

We also rely on the use of other intellectual properties in connection with the operation of our business,
including from the BBC Worldwide, DreamWorks, Bear Grylls, Marvel, Lucasfilm, Sony Pictures
Entertainment and, for the Peppa Pig Attractions, Entertainment One (which Hasbro acquired in 2019).

**_We rely on intellectual property partnerships for our business._**

We rely on developing intellectual property partnerships for the growth of our business. As the
ownership of intellectual property becomes increasingly concentrated, to the extent we continue our
strategy to develop global, regional and local intellectual property partnerships, it may be difficult for
us to procure or develop the rights to use such intellectual property. A failure to continue to develop
intellectual property partnerships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Our business is partly dependent on tourism._**

Visitor volumes at the Attractions are partly dependent on the tourism industry, comprising both
domestic tourists and, particularly in the case of the cluster of Attractions located in London, overseas
tourists. The tourism industry is influenced by a number of external factors beyond our control, any of
which may affect the number of tourists visiting the Attractions. Such factors include the general state
of the global economy and the regional economies of the country in which an Attraction is located and
the tourist’s home country, reliance on tour operators, exchange rates (particularly in the United
Kingdom as a result of the impact any fluctuations of pound sterling may have on visitor numbers at
the London cluster of Midway Attractions, including the London Eye) and international and regional
geopolitical landscapes, including any actual, attempted or threatened terrorist activity, as well as visa
requirements for countries where the Attractions are located. See “—Economic conditions beyond our
_control could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.”_

The COVID-19 outbreak had a negative effect on tourism and any further outbreaks of infectious
diseases will likely have an adverse effect on tourism. A significant reduction in the number of tourist
visitors to our Attractions, a prolonged period in which no tourists visit our Attractions or the imposition
of forced closures of our Attractions or quarantine measures could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, if transport links to, and related infrastructure such as car parks at, Attractions for any reason
become inadequate or impacted by terrorism or other detrimental activity, this could have a negative
effect on visitor volumes at the relevant Attractions. There can be no assurance that in the future the
number of tourist visitors to the Attractions will match current levels or that any decline in overseas
tourists will be wholly or partly offset by any “staycation” effect.

**_We are subject to risks resulting from exchange rate fluctuations._**

Although we prepare our financial statements in pounds sterling, we have material operations in several
countries and continue to pursue a global expansion strategy. In the 2022 financial year, we generated


-----

70 per cent. of our revenue in currencies other than pounds sterling, principally in euro and U.S. dollars.
As a result, a strengthening of the pound sterling against the euro or the U.S. dollar may materially
adversely affect our translated results of operations and vice versa. Fluctuations in currency exchange
rates, which have experienced volatility due to, amongst other reasons, the global financial downturn,
the fall in pounds sterling in the second half of 2022, have affected and may continue to affect our
operating results. Where we have clusters of Attractions in cities that attract foreign visitors, foreign
exchange fluctuations may impact inbound tourism. As we grow our overseas operations, particularly
our expansion of LEGOLAND Parks and Midway Attractions into the United States and Asia, this
effect could increase. Fluctuations in exchange rates for these or other reasons could have a material
adverse effect on our reported results of operations.

**_Our business may be adversely affected by competition._**

The Attractions compete directly with (i) other theme parks (both international destination parks and
national/regional destination parks), (ii) other regional amusement parks, (iii) other visitor attractions,
such as museums, galleries, parks and aquariums and (iv) zoos and wildlife attractions. The Attractions
compete indirectly with all other types of recreational and cultural facilities and alternative forms of
entertainment, tourism and recreation activities, including cinemas, shopping malls, new media, in
home entertainment, sporting and gaming events, both recurring events and “one off” events such as
major sporting events, and vacation travel. Within each Attraction’s regional market, the principal
factors affecting competition include the brand positioning of attractions, location, price, customer
friendliness, the uniqueness and perceived quality of the rides, activities, installations, entertainment
and/or attractions, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the Attraction and the quality of our food and other
services. Competition may limit our ability to raise admission and other prices and may require us to
make significant new investments or reduce pricing to avoid losing visitors to competitors and
competing alternatives. There can be no assurance that competition from other free and paid for
attractions or other forms of entertainment will not have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. The continued success of our business also depends, in
part, on our ability to respond to changes in our industry as a result of improvements in technology,
visitor preferences and other developments, and there can be no assurance that our failure to adapt to
these changes in a timely manner will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operation.

**_We may be adversely affected by changes in public and consumer tastes._**

The success of the Attractions depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that can change
in often unpredictable ways and on our ability to ensure that the Attractions meet the changing
preferences of the broad consumer market. Although we carry out extensive research and analysis
before opening new Midway Attractions or opening new rides or Attractions at Theme Parks, we often
invest substantial amounts before we learn the extent to which new Midway Attractions and new rides
or Attractions will earn consumer acceptance. For example, we recently made substantial investments
to roll out new format Attractions based on the Jumanji and Peppa Pig intellectual property. We may
also find it difficult to source appropriate intellectual property to invest in to successfully develop new
Attractions, rides or shows that appeal to visitors. For instance, visitor volumes at the LEGOLAND
Parks and the LEGO/LEGOLAND Discovery Centres could be adversely affected if the value of the
LEGO and/or LEGOLAND brands were to diminish as a result of changes in public and consumer
tastes or for any other reason. If visitor volumes at the LEGOLAND Parks or LEGO/LEGOLAND
Discovery Centres were to decline significantly, if our Attractions remain closed or if any new Midway
Attractions or new rides and entertainment offerings at our Attractions do not achieve sufficient
consumer acceptance, visitor volumes may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

**_The operation and development of the Attractions may be subject to planning permission and other_**
**_consents, laws and regulations._**

The operation, development and redevelopment of rides, other entertainment offerings and other
structures (including hotels) at the Attractions and the roll out and development of new Attractions may
require consent from the relevant local planning authorities as well as from third parties, such as
landlords, development partners, finance providers and regulatory bodies. There can be no assurance
that we can obtain the requisite planning or other consents as and when required in respect of
developments or redevelopments or the roll out and development of new Attractions or that they will
not be withdrawn in relation to existing offerings at any of the Attractions.

The London Eye is situated in the Borough of Lambeth and was granted planning by Lambeth Council
in November 2003 on a conditional 25-year basis. We are in the process of discharging this condition
in order to secure the permanent retention of the London Eye. While we believe that the Council shares
our desire to drive footfall in the London South Bank area where the London Eye is located and that the
London Eye is a crucial part of driving that footfall, if the outcome of the review is adverse, planning
permission for the London Eye will expire in November 2028 and we will be required to remove it.
Given the London Eye’s importance to the London tourism industry, the closure of the London Eye
could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our
relationships with the relevant local planning authorities are significant factors contributing to the
success and development of our business. We engage with local planning authorities with regard to
issues of shared concern that impact the development and redevelopment of our estate and the roll out
and development of new Attractions including sensitivities to site noise, listed structures, road
congestion and other traffic concerns and health and safety matters. If we fail to maintain such
relationships, or if such relationships were adversely affected for any reason, this could negatively
impact our ability to obtain the planning and other consents necessary for the development and
redevelopment of our Existing Estate or expansion into new sites or could result in the withdrawal of
existing consents.

Any refusal or delay in obtaining planning or other consents or the application of any special conditions
to such consents, or a breach of such conditions, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Furthermore, future grants of planning consents are likely to impose
further conditions and/or require the entry into new planning agreements. In addition, proposed
regeneration schemes may adversely impact visitor access to or the operation of individual Attractions,
particularly those in city centres. There can be no assurance that the constraints placed on our operations
by future planning consents or regeneration schemes will not be more onerous than those currently in
place, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Our business is also subject to numerous other laws and licensing and authorisation regimes in the
jurisdictions in which we operate, regulating a number of operating issues, including health and safety
procedures, equipment specifications, employment requirements, environmental laws and regulations
and requirements relating to the handling of animals. These laws and regimes are constantly subject to
change and there can be no assurance that any or all of the regulatory and licensing and authorisation
frameworks in which we operate will not become more restrictive in the future. Our strategy to expand
our operations into new countries, regions and territories increases our risk exposure to political and
regulatory changes. The impact of, and costs associated with, complying with changes in interpretation
of existing, or the adoption of new, legislation, regulations or other laws or licensing and authorisation
regimes in the jurisdictions in which we operate, or in which we have plans to operate, can be difficult
to anticipate or estimate and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

**_Our tax burden could increase due to changes in tax laws, rules or treaties or their application or_**
**_interpretation, adverse decisions of tax authorities or current or future tax audits._**

Our tax burden (including the effective tax rate and/or tax payments) could increase due to changes in
tax laws, rules or treaties or their application or interpretation, adverse decisions of tax authorities or
current or future tax audits. Our tax burden is dependent on certain aspects of tax laws and their
application and interpretation and there cannot be certainty that the relevant tax authorities are in
agreement with the Group’s application and interpretation of these laws. Any changes in tax laws or
their interpretation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

As a result of future tax audits or other review actions of the relevant tax authorities, additional taxes
could be identified, which could lead to an increase in our tax obligations, either as a result of the
relevant tax payment being levied directly on us or as a result of us becoming liable for tax as a
secondary obligor due to a primary obligor’s (such as, for example, an employee’s) failure to pay. Tax
authorities in European countries are routinely challenging corporate transactions, including financings
such as the Offering. Any future audit may require us to pay additional taxes (and any accrued interest
and penalties).

**_The comprehensive tax reform in the United States could further adversely affect our financial_**
**_condition and results of operations._**

The United States enacted comprehensive tax legislation that includes significant changes to the
taxation of business entities. These changes include, amongst others, (i) a permanent reduction to the
corporate income tax rate, (ii) a partial limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense, (iii)
a shift of the U.S. taxation of multinational corporations from a tax on worldwide income to a territorial
system (along with certain rules designed to prevent erosion of the U.S. income tax base) and (iv) a
one-time tax on accumulated offshore earnings held in cash and illiquid assets, with the latter taxed at
a lower rate, which has and could continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Failure to comply with the UK, U.S. and foreign anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and other anti-_**
**_corruption laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate could subject us to penalties_**
**_and other adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business._**

We are subject to certain UK, U.S. and foreign anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and other anticorruption laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the UK Bribery Act
and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Amongst other matters, these laws and regulations prohibit
companies and their employees, agents, consultants, contractors and other partners from authorizing,
promising, offering, providing, soliciting or receiving, directly or indirectly, corrupt or improper
payments or anything else of value to or from recipients in the public or private sector. We have
implemented anti-corruption policies and measures that are designed to educate our employees and
bring potentially improper conduct to our attention in the event an employee or affiliate fails to comply
with our policies, and these measures have successfully detected potentially improper conduct in the
past. However, there can be no assurance that these policies and measures have successfully detected
all such conduct that has occurred, nor can there be any assurance that our policies and other measures
will adequately prevent or detect possible violations under applicable anti-bribery, anti-money
laundering and anti-corruption laws in the future.

Violations of these laws and regulations can result in substantial criminal fines and civil penalties,
imprisonment, the loss of trade privileges, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation,
notifications to authorities, investigations, reputational harm and other consequences, all of which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.


-----

**_We may be subject to privacy or data protection failures._**

We are subject to regulation regarding the use of personal customer and credit card data. We process
sensitive personal customer data, including name, address, bank details and credit card details, as part
of our business and therefore must comply with strict data protection and privacy laws in the
jurisdictions in which we operate. Such laws restrict our ability to collect and use personal information
relating to customers and potential customers, including the use of that information for marketing
purposes. As we are seeing a greater incidence and impact of cyberattacks on organisations across the
globe, we are also at risk from cyber theft, hacking and ransomware. For example, in October 2022 we
experienced a breach of our IT systems. Once the breach was identified, the threat was neutralised and
we did not experience loss of service or sensitive information, and did not suffer a material impact to
our business. We believe this breach constituted an unsuccessful attempt at a potential ransomware
attack. We have since deployed measures aimed at preventing further similar attacks, such as the hiring
of additional cybersecurity personnel and advisory services, the implementation of end point detection
and response systems on our devices, enhanced laptops encryption, a centrally managed firewall and
the implementation of increased mandatory cybersecurity training amongst all employees. We seek to
ensure that procedures are in place to ensure compliance with the relevant data protection regulations
by our employees and any third-party service providers, and also implement security measures to help
prevent these crimes. Notwithstanding such efforts, we are exposed to the risk that customer data could
be wrongfully appropriated, lost, disclosed, stolen or processed in breach of data protection regulation.
If we, or any of the third-party service providers on which we rely, fail to store or transmit customer
information and online payment details in a secure manner, or if any loss of personal customer data
were otherwise to occur, we could face liability under data protection laws or sanctions by card
merchants. This could also result in the loss of the goodwill of our customers and deter new customers
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are dependent on our IT systems, which may fail or be subject to disruption._**

Our operations, including in particular our online booking systems, are dependent in part on our
information technology “IT” systems, and there is a risk that such systems could fail or that third parties
could gain unauthorised access to those systems. There can be no assurance that our IT systems are or
will continue to be able to support a significant increase in online traffic or increased customer numbers.
Although we have in place business continuity procedures and security measures in the event of IT
failures, disruption, or unauthorised access, including backup IT systems for business-critical systems,
generally in different geographic locations from the main system, these are not, and are not intended to
be, a full duplication of our operational systems. Should any of these procedures and measures not
prevent or mitigate a network failure, disruption or event of unauthorised access or should an incident
occur to a system for which there is no duplicate system, there may be a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may be subject to cash misappropriation schemes by our employees or third parties and may have_**
**_to invest in tighter control mechanisms and we may suffer losses as a result of unethical actions of_**
**_our employees or agents._**

While we have a profit protection team that seeks to limit instances of misappropriation and protect and
oversee our operations, our business deals heavily in cash and payment cards. Employees and/or
external persons can be involved in cash misappropriation schemes, ranging from taking cash from
registers at shops or restaurants to more complex theft schemes or schemes involving the appropriation
of customers’ payment card details, including those provided by customers through our websites. We
cannot guarantee that our employees or third parties will not be involved in such schemes and we cannot
completely assess the economic impact of these practices. Further, we may have to invest in tighter
control mechanisms and in the case of payment cards, invest in conforming to Payment Card Industry
standards and take other appropriate steps to protect customers’ card data. Employee theft could have a
material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and loss of
customer card data could have negative financial and public relations consequences.


-----

In addition, we have faced instances in the past, and may again face instances in the future, where our
employees or agents have acted unethically, and where such actions have resulted in losses for us. This
may occur in the form of employees or agents accepting or soliciting kickbacks for placing contracts,
undermining our procurement process, or arranging or attempting to arrange transactions from which
employees improperly profit at our expense. In such cases, we may suffer losses as a result of
overpayment for goods or services, unsatisfactory work products or reputational damage, and we may
be subject to costs, fines or other sanctions as a result of investigating such instances, terminating
employees engaging in such conduct, reassessment of taxes in respect of deductions or VAT for such
goods or services, or other negative consequences. Any such consequences could have a material
adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may be materially adversely affected because of risks associated with leases on certain of our_**
**_properties._**

A significant number of our properties are leased from third-party landlords. We may not be able to
renew our leasehold interests on their expiry or to renew them on terms which are as favourable as
current terms. We lease Alton Towers Resort, Heide Park Resort, THORPE PARK Resort and Warwick
Castle from LXi REIT, which are currently valid until 2077, and we have a right to renew each lease
for a 35-year period on materially similar terms, subject to an adjustment to market rates at that time.

Although the Heide Park Resort lease contains the same contractual rights of renewal as the other leases
under the sale and leaseback arrangements, as a matter of German law, LXi REIT has the right to
terminate the lease after 30 years, notwithstanding the terms of the lease. Madame Tussauds London
leases its site from Fubon MTL Property (Jersey) Ltd. In May 2012, we entered into a sale and leaseback
arrangement with Richie Properties in respect of the LEGOLAND Windsor Hotel. The lease for
LEGOLAND Windsor Hotel was subsequently transferred to Aberdeen Standard Investments. In 2017,
we developed LEGOLAND Japan under our “leased and operated” model. Our local operating
company leases the site and park infrastructure from development partners, including KIRKBI and LLJ
Investco K.K, a subsidiary of KIRKBI. The lease is for a period of 50 years. In addition, we enter into
leases for sites within the Midway Attractions operating group and central areas, which are typically of
a duration between ten and 60 years with options to renew leases in line with local market practice in
the territories concerned. Rent increases are also determined based on local market practice. In addition
to a fixed rental element, rents within the Midway Attractions operating group can also contain a
performance related element, typically based on turnover at the site concerned. If our performance
remains low, future performance declines, inflation and rent charges increase, or the actual costs of
removing assets and restoring our leased sites at the end of the lease term are much higher than
anticipated, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

A number of our property leases and licences may be terminated in the event of breach and certain other
circumstances. For example, part of the London Eye site is operated in the current location pursuant to
a licence granted to us by the Port of London Authority, the remainder of which is held by us pursuant
to various leases. Revocation of this license by the Port of London Authority is possible on three
months’ notice, subject to the right of appeal to the UK Government, in certain exceptional
circumstances, including an un remedied breach of the licence, the insolvency of the licensee or if the
Port of London Authority exercises its statutory powers for navigational or river regime reasons. If the
licence were terminated, we would be unable to continue to operate the London Eye, which could
significantly impact our revenue. The termination of the leases on any of our properties, and in particular
on any of the sale and leaseback properties or the London Eye, could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

**_We or the Consortium may pursue further growth organically or through acquisitions or new joint_**
**_ventures which, if consummated, could increase the level of our indebtedness and contingent_**
**_liabilities and may adversely affect our business if we cannot effectively integrate these new_**
**_operations._**

We or the Consortium have in the past completed and may in the future complete acquisitions of
businesses and joint ventures that we believe will present opportunities to realize synergies and
strengthen our market position. Any such acquisition or joint venture could result in the incurrence of
debt or contingent liabilities and an increase in interest expenses and amortization expenses.
Acquisitions and joint ventures, including the Acquisition, involve numerous other risks, including
difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies
and joint ventures, along with unforeseen liabilities and costs, any of which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are subject to risks from legal and arbitration proceedings._**

From time to time, we are involved in litigation and other tax, labour and legal proceedings, the
outcomes of which may be difficult to predict. We have been involved in legal disputes that involved
substantial claims for damages and other payments in the past, and we may become involved in such
proceedings in the future. In the event of a negative outcome in any material legal proceeding, whether
based on a judgment or a settlement agreement, we could be obliged to make substantial payments.
Even if there is a positive outcome to such proceedings, negative publicity and advisory costs, to the
extent they are not reimbursable by other litigants or insurance, could adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer and our_**
**_insurance costs may increase._**

We seek to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates. Although we
carry property and casualty insurance to cover certain risks, our insurance policies do not cover all types
of losses and liabilities and are subject to limits and excesses. There can be no assurance that our
insurance will be sufficient to cover the full extent of all losses or liabilities for which we are insured
and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew our current insurance policies on favourable
terms, or at all. For example, after the accident at the Alton Towers Resort in June 2015, our insurance
premiums increased. In addition, if we or other visitor attraction operators sustain significant losses or
make significant insurance claims, then our ability to obtain future insurance coverage at commercially
reasonable rates could be materially adversely affected.

**_If we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting or remediate any future_**
**_significant deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may be unable to_**
**_accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, which would have a material adverse effect_**
**_on our financial results._**

Our internal controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS,
including new standards under IFRS that come into effect from time to time. Effective internal controls
over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable reports and prevent fraud. Internal
control systems provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control
system are met. Because of such inherent limitations in control systems, no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have
been detected. For example, we have previously terminated certain individuals’ employment with us
due to acts of fraud, and on a limited number of occasions, we have had concerns with respect to internal
financial controls at certain Attractions. Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial
reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business.


-----

**_Changes to accounting standards may affect our reporting of financial results._**

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS. Any recent
or future changes in these accounting standards may have a significant impact on our reported results
and financial condition. In particular, there are a number of standards, amendments and interpretations
which have been issued by the IASB and IFRS standards are subject to change. Certain IFRS standards
have been recently revised by the IASB.

In 2020, the International Accounting Standards Board issued amendments to the “IFRS 16 Leases”
principle in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to allow lessees not to account for rent concessions
as lease modifications if these are a direct consequence of COVID-19 and certain other conditions were
met. As a lessee, we applied such amendments and, accordingly, where the Group agreed concessions
in the form of a one-off reduction in rent, these have been accounted for as a variable lease payment in
each of the 2020, 2021 and 2022 financial years (leading to a recognition of a charge in our profit/(loss)
of £1 million in 2020, £1 million in 2021 and £1 million in 2022).

Moreover, IAS 37 was amended with effect from 1 January 2022 to clarify that when assessing if a
contract is onerous, the cost of fulfilling it includes all costs related directly to the contract. IAS 16 was
also amended with effect from 1 January 2022 to provide that the cost of an item of property, plant and
equipment recognised in the balance sheet includes the costs of testing the asset prior to it being
available for its intended use. The amendments to standards and interpretations discussed were
implemented in 2022 with no significant impact to the Group.

In addition, in 2021 the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) issued
an agenda decision in relation to the accounting treatment for configuration and customisation costs in
cloud computing arrangements. This decision clarified that in order for an intangible asset to be
capitalised in relation to configuration and customisation costs in a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”)
arrangement, it is necessary for there to be control of the underlying software asset or for there to be a
separate intangible asset which meets the definition in IAS 38 ‘Intangible assets’. We updated our
accounting policy in the financial statements to align with the clarified guidance within the IFRIC
agenda decision. As a result, we have expensed all costs previously capitalised associated with both the
configuration and customisation of these SaaS arrangements. See “Presentation of Financial
_Information—Historical Financial Statements—Restated Financial Statements.”_

Further, our assumptions, estimates and judgments related to complex accounting matters could
significantly affect our financial results. IFRS and related accounting pronouncements, implementation
guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business,
including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, impairment of long-lived assets, leases and related
economic transactions, intangibles, self-insurance, income taxes, property and equipment, litigation and
equity based compensation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and
judgments by us. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions,
estimates or judgments by us could require us to make changes to our accounting systems to implement
these changes that could increase our operating costs, and could significantly change our reported or
expected financial performance.

**_We are subject to automatic exchange of information._**

Under the terms of the FATCA Law and CRS Law (as defined herein), the Issuer is treated as a
Luxembourg Reporting Financial Institution. As such, the Issuer may require all holders of Notes to
provide documentary evidence of their tax residence and all other information deemed necessary to
comply with the above-mentioned regulations.

Should the Issuer become subject to a withholding tax and/or penalties as a result of non-compliance
under the FATCA Law and/or penalties as a result of non-compliance under the CRS Law, the value of
the Notes held by all holders of Notes may be materially affected.


-----

Furthermore, the Issuer may also be required to withhold tax on certain payments to its holders of Notes
which would not be compliant with the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (“FATCA”)
(i.e., the so called foreign passthru payments withholding tax obligation).

**_We are subject to the exchange of information on reportable cross-border arrangements_**

Following the adoption of the Luxembourg law of 25 March 2020, as amended from time to time (the
“DAC 6 Law”) implementing Council Directive (EU) 2018/822 of 25 May 2018 amending Directive
2011/16/EU as regards mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation in relation
to reportable cross-border arrangements (“DAC 6”), certain intermediaries and, in certain cases,
taxpayers have to report certain information on reportable cross-border arrangements to the
Luxembourg tax authorities within a specific timeframe.

A reportable cross-border arrangement is any cross-border arrangement involving one or more of
certain types of taxes, and containing at least one hallmark (i.e., a characteristic or feature that presents
an indication of a potential risk of tax avoidance) as set out in the DAC 6 Law. A cross-border
arrangement will only fall within the scope of the DAC 6 Law if one of the following triggering events
occurs: the arrangement is made available, or is ready for implementation, or the first step of the
implementation of the arrangement is taken; or aid, assistance or advice is provided with respect to
designing, marketing, organising, making available for implementation or managing the
implementation of a reportable cross-border arrangement.

The reported information will be automatically exchanged by the Luxembourg tax authorities with the
competent authorities of all other EU Member States. As the case may be, the Issuer may take any
action that it deems required, necessary, advisable, desirable or convenient to comply with the reporting
obligations imposed on intermediaries and/or taxpayers pursuant to the DAC 6 Law. Failure to provide
the necessary information under DAC 6 may result in the application of fines or penalties in the relevant
EU jurisdiction(s) involved in the cross-border arrangement in question. Under the DAC 6 Law, late
reporting, incomplete or inaccurate reporting, or non-reporting may be subject to a fine of up to
€250,000.

**_We are subject to the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and the European Anti-Tax Avoidance_**
**_Directives._**

It should be noted that fiscal policy and practice is constantly evolving and at present the pace of
evolution has been quickened due to a number of developments. In particular, the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development together with the G20 countries have committed to address
abusive global tax avoidance, referred to as base erosion and profit shifting (“BEPS”) through 15 actions
detailed in reports released on 5 October 2015 and through the Inclusive Framework on a global
consensus solution to reform the international corporate tax system via a two-pillar plan agreed in 2021
(“BEPS 2.0”).

As part of the BEPS project, new rules dealing, inter alia, with the abuse of double tax treaties, the
definition of permanent establishments, controlled foreign companies, a restriction on the deductibility
of excessive interest and hybrid mismatch arrangements, are being introduced into respective domestic
law of BEPS member states via EU directives and a multilateral instrument.

The Council of the European Union has adopted two Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives (being, Council
Directive (EU) 2016/1164 of 12 July 2016 laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that
directly affect the functioning of the internal market (“ATAD I”) and Directive 2017/952/EU of 29 May
2017 amending ATAD I as regards hybrid mismatches with third countries (“ATAD II”) that address
many of the above mentioned issues). The measures included in ATAD I were implemented into
Luxembourg law on 21 December 2018 (the “ATAD I Law”) and almost all of these measures are
applicable since 1 January 2019. On 19 December 2019, the Luxembourg Parliament adopted the
Luxembourg law implementing ATAD II (“ATAD II _Law”). The ATAD II provisions apply as from_


-----

fiscal years starting on or after 1 January 2020 (except for the provision targeting reverse hybrid
mismatches, which will apply as from fiscal years closing in 2022). The ATAD I Law and the ATAD
II Law may have a material impact on how returns to investors are taxed.

On 22 December 2021, the European Commission issued a proposal for a Council Directive laying
down rules to prevent the misuse of shell entities for tax purposes within the EU (“ATAD III”). The
draft ATAD III rules aim to introduce an EU-wide substance test to facilitate the identification of
undertakings that perform no or minimal economic activity, do not have a minimum level of substance
and are misused to obtain tax advantages (so-called “shell companies”). The draft rules also provide for
specific tax consequences for undertakings that have insufficient substance under ATAD III. ATAD III
is expected to be adopted in the coming months. However, there is significant uncertainty as to the
development of the draft ATAD III and its implementation into domestic law. This could result in
additional reporting and disclosure obligations within the Issuer structure and/or affect returns to the
Issuer and the investors.

Furthermore, the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to prevent Base
Erosion and Profit Shifting (“MLI”) was published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (“OECD”) on 24 November 2016. The aim of the MLI is to update international tax rules
and lessen the opportunity for tax avoidance by transposing the results from the BEPS project into more
than 2,000 double tax treaties worldwide. A number of jurisdictions (including Luxembourg) have
signed the MLI. Luxembourg ratified the MLI through the law dated 7 March 2019 and deposited its
instrument of ratification with the OECD on 9 April 2019. As such, the MLI entered into force for
Luxembourg on 1 August 2019. Its application per double tax treaty concluded with Luxembourg will
depend on the ratification by the other contracting state and on the type of tax concerned. Subsequent
changes in tax treaties negotiated by Luxembourg could adversely affect the returns from the Issuer to
its investors.

BEPS 2.0 has two parts, known as Pillar I and Pillar II, which seek to address the tax challenges arising
from the digitalisation of the economy, and would apply to large multi-national enterprises (“MNE”).

Pillar I aims to introduce a mechanism for the reallocation of taxing rights to market jurisdictions (i.e.,
jurisdictions in which goods or services are supplied or consumers are located). The OECD is targeting
2023 for the implementation of Pillar I and the detail of this initiative (and therefore its effect on the
Issuer and on the investors return on investment) is subject to change and currently remains subject to
significant uncertainty.

In December 2021, following a Pillar II agreement signed by more than 135 jurisdictions in October
2021, the OECD published final model rules for a global minimum tax (the “GloBE rules”). The GloBE
rules aim to ensure that large MNE groups pay a minimum level of tax on the income arising in each of
the jurisdictions where they operate, by imposing a top-up tax whenever the effective tax rate,
determined on a jurisdictional basis, is below the minimum rate of 15%. Council Directive (EU)
2022/2523 of 14 December 2022 on ensuring a global minimum level of taxation for multinational
enterprise groups and large-scale domestic groups in the Union builds on the GloBE rules and will apply
to any MNE group which has an annual revenue of €750,000,000 or more, including the revenue of
excluded entities, in its ultimate parent entity’s consolidated financial statements in at least two of the
four fiscal years immediately preceding the tested fiscal year and with either a parent entity or a
subsidiary located in an EU Member State. Certain entities are excluded from its scope, including i.a.
investment entities that are ultimate parent entities and certain entities owned by these excluded entities.
Member States must implement the Directive in their domestic laws by 31 December 2023, with the
income inclusion rule (“IIR”) entering into effect for fiscal years beginning from 31 December 2023,
and the undertaxed profit rule (“UTPR”) entering into effect for fiscal years beginning from 31
December 2024. Effective tax rates could increase within the Issuer’s structure (if in scope) due to
higher amounts of tax being due or possible denial of deductions. Costs of tax compliance may also
increase. This could adversely affect any returns to the investors.

**Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure**

**_To service our indebtedness, we require a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate_**
**_cash will depend on many factors beyond our control._**

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, and to fund planned capital
expenditures depends in part on our ability to generate cash in the future. This depends on the success
of our business strategy and on general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and
other factors, as well as the other factors discussed in these “—Risks Related to the Notes and Our
_Structure,” many of which are beyond our control._

We cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that we will realise
operating improvements on schedule or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount
sufficient to enable us to service and repay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.
Furthermore, applicable law and future contractual arrangements may impose restrictions on our
subsidiaries’ ability to make payments to us, which could impact our ability to pay our obligations as
they mature or to fund its liquidity needs.

If we are unable to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans,
such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital
investments or seeking to raise additional capital. We cannot assure you that any refinancing or debt
restructuring would be possible, or if possible, that it would be on similar terms to those of our debt
instruments existing at that time, that any assets could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of the sales and
the amount of proceeds realised from those sales would be favourable to us or that additional financing
could be obtained on acceptable terms. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely
affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs or to refinance our indebtedness, including potentially our
ability to draw on our then existing credit facilities or enter into new credit facilities. Banks that are
party to our credit facilities may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience
shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from
us and other borrowers within a short period of time.

**_Certain of our Indebtedness is permitted, subject to repayment of our term facilities, to have priority_**
**_with respect to the receipt of proceeds of enforcement of Collateral and certain distressed disposals._**

The Notes will allow certain credit facilities indebtedness (including the Revolving Facility) and certain
hedging obligations to have priority with respect to the receipt of proceeds from the enforcement of the
Collateral and certain distressed disposals in priority to Holders of the Notes pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement. Subject to repayment in full of the
term facilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement (or receipt of consent thereunder), the Senior
Facilities will similarly permit certain designated credit facility indebtedness (including the Revolving
Facility) and certain hedging obligations to have priority with respect to the receipt of proceeds from
the enforcement of the Collateral and certain distressed disposals in priority to any debt not so
designated under the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement. To the extent
incurred, such revolving credit facilities indebtedness and hedging obligations will have different rights
and obligations than the Notes, including with respect to the right to instruct the Security Agent to
enforce the Collateral, to give or refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the
Collateral as they see fit or otherwise provide instructions as part of an instructing group, which rights
and obligations shall be generally consistent with, or otherwise not materially less favourable to the
other secured parties, than those customary for facilities of a similar nature to the revolving facility on
the date that such facility is committed (as conclusively determined by the Group). See “Description of
_Notes.”_

Further, following such designation, the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement will be modified or
an Additional Intercreditor Agreement governing the sharing of proceeds from enforcement of the
Collateral would be expected to require the Security Agent to apply turned over amounts and other
recoveries from enforcement actions toward discharging the obligations in respect of indebtedness that


-----

is permitted to have priority with respect to the receipt of proceeds from the enforcement of the
Collateral and certain distressed disposals in priority to applying any such amounts toward discharging
the Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral, you may not benefit from such
recoveries. Any proceeds remaining from an enforcement sale of the Collateral will, after all obligations
under such liabilities have been discharged, be applied _pro rata in repayment of the Existing 2026_
Notes, and the Notes, and any other indebtedness that shares in the Collateral on a pari passu basis with
the Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and
“Description of Notes—Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor
_Agreements.”_

**_Our substantial debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent us from_**
**_fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes._**

We use debt, among other things, to finance our operations and in connection with our capital
investment strategy. Under the Senior Facilities Agreement, we have a Revolving Facility (which is
currently undrawn by way of cash loans while £30 million has been utilized by way of certain ancillary
facilities, including letters of credit), a EUR Term Loan B and a USD Term Loan B (each of which
were fully cash drawn in the amount of €1,460 million and $382.5 million, respectively, as of the date
of this Offering Memorandum). The Liquidity Covenant under our Revolving Facility is tested on each
financial quarter-end date which falls during the Financial Covenant Waiver Period, the springing
financial covenant under our Revolving Facility will be tested on September 30, 2023 if the Revolving
Facility is drawn above 40 per cent. by way of cash loans (and excluding utilisations by way of letters
of credit or under ancillary facilities) on such date.

As of 1 April 2023, our total indebtedness (excluding leases), on an as adjusted basis to give effect to
the Transactions, amounted to £3,927 million. See “Capitalisation.”

Our substantial debt could have important consequences for our business and operations and for holders
of the Notes, including, but not limited to:

- making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes;

- increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse
economic and industry conditions;

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment
of principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash
flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, developments or other general corporate
purposes;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the
competitive environment and the industry in which we operate;

- increasing our exposure to interest rate increases because some of our indebtedness bears a
floating rate of interest, placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors
that are not as highly leveraged and restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or
exploiting certain business opportunities;

- limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing;
and

- limiting our ability to upstream cash from our non-guarantor subsidiaries to help meet our
obligations under the Notes.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
satisfy our debt obligations, including under the Notes. The terms of the Indenture and the Senior


-----

Facilities Agreement restrict, but do not prohibit, our subsidiaries from incurring additional
indebtedness. All of the debt of our non-guarantor subsidiaries would be structurally senior to the Notes,
including any interest payment on the Notes as a result of any further issuance of Notes. If we incur
new debt in addition to our current debt level, the related risks that we now face, as described above
and elsewhere in these “Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure” could intensify.

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our_**
**_debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our business._**

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the Existing 2026 Indenture, the
Existing Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement contain, and the Indenture will
contain, restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of
significant qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the amount of debt that could
be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Sale and leaseback transactions
as well as lease obligations, including those that were classified as finance leases in Merlin’s financial
statements prior to the implementation of IFRS 16, are not considered debt under the terms of the Senior
Facilities Agreement, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture and the Indenture. Certain financial
definitions included in the Indenture that are used in determining whether certain actions, including the
incurrence of additional indebtedness, are permitted under the Indenture, including the definition of
“GAAP,” have been adjusted from their ordinary meaning and therefore the Indenture may allow for
more indebtedness to be incurred (or otherwise be more favourable to the Issuer) than if the ordinary
meaning of such financial definitions had been used. The terms of the Existing 2026 Indenture, the
Existing Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Indenture permit us to incur
future debt that may have substantially the same covenants as, or covenants that are more restrictive
than, those of the Indenture. Moreover, the debt we may incur in the future could be structurally senior
to the Notes, could mature prior to the Notes or may be secured by collateral that does not secure the
Notes. In addition, the Existing 2026 Indenture, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior
Facilities Agreement and the Indenture will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not
constitute debt under those agreements. The incurrence of additional debt would increase the leverage
related risks described in this Offering Memorandum.

**_We may incur additional indebtedness prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue_**
**_Date of the Notes, which indebtedness could increase our leverage and may have terms that are more_**
**_or less favorable than the terms of the Notes and our other existing indebtedness._**

We or our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt, including in connection with a refinancing
of our existing debt, to fund any future acquisition, repay indebtedness or for any other general corporate
purposes. In connection with our financial strategy, we continually evaluate different financing
alternatives, and we may decide to enter into new credit facilities, access the debt capital markets or
incur other indebtedness from time to time, including following the consummation of this offering and
prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue Date of the Notes. Any such offering or
incurrence of debt will be made at our election or the election of our relevant subsidiaries, and if such
debt is in the form of securities, would be offered and sold pursuant to, and on the terms described in,
a separate offering memorandum. The interest rate with respect to any such additional debt will be set
at the time of the pricing or incurrence of such debt and may be less than or greater than the interest rate
applicable to the Notes and our other existing debt, including, in the case of a refinancing, the debt that
is being refinanced, which would have a corresponding effect on our cash interest expense on a pro
forma basis. In addition, the maturity date of any such additional debt will be set at the time of pricing
or incurrence of such debt and may be earlier or later than the maturity date of the Notes and our other
existing debt. The other terms of such additional debt would be as agreed with the relevant lenders or
holders thereof and could be more or less favorable than the terms of the Notes or our other existing
indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we or our subsidiaries will elect to raise any such
additional debt or that any effort to raise such debt will be successful, and there can be no assurance as
to the timing of such offering or incurrence, the amount or terms of any such additional debt. If we incur


-----

new debt in addition to our current debt, the related risks that we now face, even in a refinancing
transaction, as described above and elsewhere in this ‘“Risk Factors” section could intensify.

**_Certain of our borrowings bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing our_**
**_interest cost and reducing cash flow._**

A part of our indebtedness, including borrowings under the Senior Facilities Agreement, is indexed to
variable rates and exposes us to direct interest rate risks that could lead to a material increase in our
obligations. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, thereby increasing our interest
expenses associated with these obligations even if the amount borrowed remained the same. This would
reduce the cash flow available to finance our operations and future commercial opportunities and could
hinder our ability to service our debt, including our ability to make payments on the Notes. There can
be no assurance that we will, or will be able to, hedge our full exposure or that our hedging transactions
will be effective. The use of derivatives is a highly specialised activity that involves investment
techniques and risks different from those associated with our ordinary business. Depending on market
conditions and movements in interest rates, our use of hedging transactions could enhance or harm our
overall performance compared to our competitors. In addition, we will be subject to the creditworthiness
of the counterparties under our hedging transactions, and we will be exposed to the risk of insolvency
or default on the part of our hedge counterparties. Our business, financial condition and results of
operations could be materially and adversely affected in the event that one or more of these risks
materialise. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Disclosure About Market and Credit Risks—Interest Rate Risk.”_

**_Changes or uncertainty in respect of LIBOR, EURIBOR or other interest rate benchmarks may_**
**_affect our sources of funding._**

Some of our sources of funding are linked to LIBOR, EURIBOR or other interest rate benchmarks. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.”

Various rates or indices which are deemed to be “reference rates,” including the London Interbank
Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”), the Sterling Over Night Index
Average (“SONIA”) and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), have been and are the subject
of recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Proposed reforms by
regulators include changes to the manner in which certain reference rates are determined, their
discontinuance, or the establishment of alternative reference rates. Some reforms are already effective,
including the EU Benchmark Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011) and the cessation of the
publication of the sterling LIBOR benchmark and certain tenors of the U.S. dollar LIBOR benchmark
after December 31, 2021, while others are still to be implemented. In particular, on March 5, 2021, the
UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit
rates for the calculation of the U.S. dollar LIBOR benchmark after June 30, 2023. These reforms and
other pressures may cause the applicable LIBOR, EURIBOR, SONIA, SOFR or other such benchmarks
to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology
or otherwise), and may create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or
participate in certain benchmarks, require amendments to debt documents, result in rates being
determined for a period by applicable fallback provisions which may not operate as intended, or have
other consequences which cannot be predicted. Based on the foregoing, any of these reforms or
pressures or any other changes to a relevant interest rate benchmark, as well as manipulative practices
or the cessation thereof, could affect the level of the published rate, including by causing a sudden or
prolonged increase and/or making it more volatile than it would otherwise be, which could have an
adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates calculated by reference
to interest rate benchmarks.

**_Restrictions imposed by the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Existing 2026 Indenture, the Existing_**
**_Senior Notes Indenture and our other debt agreements limit, and restrictions imposed by the_**
**_Indenture will limit, our ability to take certain actions._**

The Senior Facilities Agreement, the Existing 2026 Indenture, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture and
our other outstanding debt agreements limit, and the Indenture will limit, our flexibility to operate our
business. For example, certain of these agreements restrict our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability
to, amongst other things:

- incur or guarantee additional debt and issue preferred stock;

- make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions;

- make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures or
undertaking capital expenditures;

- prepay or redeem subordinated debt;

- engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

- create unrestricted subsidiaries;

- agree to limitations on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions;

- sell assets, consolidate or merge with or into other companies;

- sell or transfer all or substantially all our assets or those of our subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis;

- issue or sell share capital of certain subsidiaries;

- impair the security interests granted for the benefit of the holders of the Notes;

- undertake certain activities, own certain assets or incur certain liabilities; and

- create or incur or suffer to exist certain liens.

The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Existing
2026 Indenture, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture, the Indenture and certain of our other debt
agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage
in other business activities that may be in our interest. In addition to limiting our flexibility in operating
our business, a breach of the covenants in the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Existing 2026 Indenture,
the Existing Senior Notes Indenture or the Indenture could cause a default under the terms of each of
those agreements, causing all the debt under those agreements to be accelerated. If this were to occur,
we may not have sufficient assets to repay our debt.

**_Our failure to comply with the covenants under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Existing 2026_**
**_Indenture, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture or the Indenture, including as a result of events_**
**_beyond our control, could result in an event of default which could materially and adversely affect_**
**_our financial condition and results of operations._**

The Existing 2026 Indenture and the Existing Senior Notes Indenture require, and the Indenture will
require, us and our restricted subsidiaries to comply with various covenants, and the Senior Facilities
Agreement requires us and our subsidiaries (or certain of our subsidiaries) to comply with various
covenants, including, in the case of the Revolving Facility thereunder, certain financial and/or liquidity
covenants, which require us and our subsidiaries (or certain of our subsidiaries) to maintain specified
financial ratios or available liquidity amounts, satisfy specified financial tests and comply with


-----

operational parameters and certain other undertakings. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants,”
“Description of Certain Financing _Arrangements—Existing 2026 Notes,” “Description of Certain_
_Financing Arrangements—Existing_ _Senior Notes” and “Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement.” Our ability to meet these financial ratios, financial tests_
and/or liquidity thresholds could be affected by deterioration in our operating results, as well as by
events beyond our control, including unfavourable economic conditions, and we cannot assure you that
we will be able to meet these financial ratios and financial tests. Moreover, the Senior Facilities
Agreement includes certain events of default (such as breaches of representations, warranties and
undertakings and if we fail to make payment when due on certain other debt) that are in addition to the
events of default set forth in the Indenture. If an event of default occurs under the Senior Facilities
Agreement, the Existing 2026 Indenture, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture, the Indenture or any of
our other debt instruments and is not cured or waived, the holders of the defaulted debt could terminate
their commitments and declare all outstanding debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other
fees, to be immediately due and payable. Borrowings under our other debt instruments, including the
Notes, that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions also may be accelerated or become
payable on demand as a result of an event of default under the Senior Facilities Agreement or other debt
instruments. In these circumstances, our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to repay in full the
defaulted debt and our other debt, including the Notes then outstanding. If some or all of these
instruments were accelerated, we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, and we may not be
able to repay its obligations under the Notes in such an event.

**_Certain actions in respect of defaults taken under the Indenture by beneficial owners with short_**
**_positions in excess of their interests in the Notes will be disregarded._**

By acceptance of the Notes, each holder of Notes agrees, in connection with certain notices of Default
(as defined under “Description of Notes”), notices of acceleration or instructions to the Trustee to
provide certain notices of Default, notices of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder
_Direction”), to (i) deliver a written representation to the Issuer and the Trustee that such holder and any_
of its affiliates acting in concert with it in connection with its investment in the Notes (other than
screened affiliates) are not (or, in the case such holder is Euroclear, Clearstream or their respective
nominee, that such holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that (together with such
affiliates) are not) Net Short (as defined under “Description of Notes”) and (ii) provide the Issuer with
such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the
accuracy of such holder’s representation within five business days of request therefor. Holders of the
Notes, including holders that have hedged their exposure to the Notes in the ordinary course and not for
speculative purposes, may not be able to make such representations or provide the requested additional
information. These restrictions may impact a holder’s ability to participate in Noteholder Directions.

**_The Issuer and certain Guarantors are dependent upon distributions or cash flow from other Group_**
**_companies to meet their obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees._**

The Issuer is a private limited liability company (société à responsabilité limitée) incorporated under
the laws of Luxembourg for purposes of facilitating the Acquisition and performing certain activities
related thereto. The Issuer has no material assets, other than derivative assets to hedge certain interest
rate exposures arising from debt issued by the Issuer, equity interests in, and/or intercompany balances
with, other subsidiaries or affiliates of the Group. Such derivative assets are recognised in the
consolidated financial statements of JVco, but are off-balance sheet in the Issuer’s financial statements,
in accordance with Luxembourg GAAP. The Issuer has no revenue generating activities of its own and
no business operations. The Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes is dependent directly upon
other payments it receives from other members of the Group in the form of dividends, loans, interest
and payments on intercompany loans or other distributions. Similarly, certain Guarantors are holding
companies and will be wholly dependent upon arrangements with their respective subsidiaries to meet
their respective obligations under the Guarantees.


-----

The ability of certain of the Guarantors’ subsidiaries to make distributions or other payments to the
Guarantors will depend upon their respective cash flows and earnings, as well as applicable law.
Furthermore, the Guarantors’ subsidiaries will also be restricted by the terms of their present and future
indebtedness in their ability to make distributions or advance up stream loans to enable us and the
Guarantors to make payments in respect of the Notes or the Guarantees, as the case may be. In addition,
applicable tax laws may subject such payments to further taxation and may limit the amounts that some
of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests or even
prevent such payments. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the dividend and distribution capacity
will be adequate to fund distributions in amounts and at times sufficient for us to pay our obligations as
they become due under the Notes. For more information about limitations on distributions, see “Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees_
_and Security.”_

**_The Collateral may not all initially secure the Notes and the Guarantees._**

The Security Documents existing as of the date of this Offering Memorandum purport to provide that
certain future indebtedness of the Issuer and its Affiliates which is designated under the Intercreditor
Agreement to be secured by the Collateral (including the Notes) will be secured by the Collateral.
Pursuant to applicable local law, such provisions may not be sufficient to ensure that such future
indebtedness (including the Notes) are in fact secured by the Collateral. Accordingly, the Notes and the
Guarantees may not be secured by all or part of the Collateral until appropriate security confirmations
and/or supplemental security interests are entered into, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, within
30 days of the Issue Date.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all of the debt and liabilities of MAL’s subsidiaries_**
**_that are not Guarantors (other than the Issuer)._**

The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all of the debt and liabilities of MAL’s subsidiaries that
do not guarantee the Notes (other than the Issuer). Generally, claims of creditors of a subsidiary that
does not provide a Guarantee, including trade creditors and claims of preference shareholders (if any)
of such subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such subsidiary over the
claims of creditors of its parent entity. In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding up,
liquidation, reorganisation, administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any of our
subsidiaries that do not provide a Guarantee, holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will
generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets
are made available for distribution to its parent entity. As such, the Notes will be structurally
subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of our
subsidiaries that do not provide a Guarantee. Our subsidiaries may not have sufficient funds to pay (or
receive sufficient funds to pay) all their respective creditors, and you may not receive any payment on
the Notes or receive less, rateably, than the holders of debt of our subsidiaries and other liabilities.
Subject to certain limitations, our subsidiaries will be permitted to incur additional debt and liabilities
in the future under the terms of the Existing 2026 Indenture, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture and
the Indenture. In addition, we will be permitted under the terms of the Indenture to incur additional
secured debt without securing the Notes, and such secured debt will have priority with respect to the
collateral granted.

**_The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has been granted as_**
**_security for the Notes and existing and future secured debt may be secured by certain assets that do_**
**_not secure the Notes._**

The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral described in this Offering
Memorandum. See “Description of Notes—Security.” The Shared Collateral will also secure the Senior
Facilities, certain hedging obligations and the Existing 2026 Notes on a first priority basis and the
Existing Senior Notes on a second priority basis and may secure additional debt ranking pari passu with
the Notes and the Guarantees. The rights of the holders may be diluted by any increase in the debt


-----

secured by the Collateral or a reduction of the Collateral securing the Notes. In addition, to the extent
the claims of the holders of the Notes exceed the value of the Collateral securing the Notes and the
Guarantees, those claims will generally rank equally with the claims of the holders of all other existing
and future senior debt ranking pari passu with the Notes and the Guarantees. As a result, if the value of
the assets pledged as Collateral is less than the value of the claims of the holders of the Notes, those
claims may not be satisfied in full.

In addition, not all of our assets secure the Notes, and the Indenture allows the Parent Guarantor and its
restricted subsidiaries to secure certain types of debt permitted to be incurred under the Indenture (which
may be structurally senior to the Notes and the Guarantees) with the property and assets of the restricted
subsidiaries that will not secure the Notes. The value of such assets and property could be significant.
If an event of default occurs and the obligations under the Notes are accelerated, the Notes and the
Guarantees will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt, and will rank equally with the
holders of other unsecured debt of the Notes and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to any property
or assets that is excluded from the Collateral securing the Notes or such secured debt.

In addition, the Guarantees will be limited to the same extent as set forth under “Certain Insolvency
_Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and_
_Security,” which limitations could be significant. See also “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance_
_laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely_
_affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral.”_

**_Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

The Existing 2026 Notes were entered into prior to the Acquisition. Following the Acquisition, and
pursuant to a consent from noteholders, the Existing 2026 Notes were rolled over and received equal
and ratable security over the collateral securing the Senior Facilities pursuant to the negative pledge
covenant under the Existing 2026 Indenture. While the trustee in respect of the Existing 2026 Notes
entered into the Intercreditor Agreement in order to facilitate collateral sharing, certain features of the
Intercreditor Agreement do not apply to this creditor group.

The obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees thereof are secured on a first ranking basis with
security interests over the Collateral that also secure our obligations under the Senior Facilities
Agreement, the Existing 2026 Notes and certain hedging and operating facility obligations. The
Indenture will also permit Collateral to secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms
thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent
will only enforce the Collateral as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and the Indenture
regulates the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take
enforcement action.

The Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing
group that consists of the holders of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, the
senior lenders, creditors in respect of indebtedness ranking _pari passu with the senior creditors_
(including the Existing 2026 Notes) and creditors in respect of certain hedging obligations (the “Senior
_Secured Credit Participations”) which aggregate more than 66[2]/3% of the total Senior Secured Credit_
Participations at that time (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”) (in each case acting through their
respective creditor representatives). If the Majority Senior Secured Creditors do not instruct the Security
Agent to enforce or instruct the Security Agent to cease enforcing the transaction security, then creditors
holding more than 50% of the total second lien credit participations (or, in certain cases, creditor holding
50% of the total senior parent credit participations, including in relation to the Shared Collateral, the
holders of the Existing Senior Notes) may instruct the Security Agent to enforce.

The Security Agent may also refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions that may in its
discretion require for any cost, loss or liability which it may incur in complying with those instructions
until it has been indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction.


-----

At the date of this Offering Memorandum, the lenders under the Senior Facilities may constitute the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors. In addition, to the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is
secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes, the voting interest of holders of Notes in an instructing
group will be diluted commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we incur.

Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the Notes
will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Collateral or to exercise
any rights or powers arising under the Collateral, except through the Security Agent as provided in the
Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Notes, you will be deemed to have agreed to these
restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and
recourse against the Issuer and the Guarantors in the event of a default.

**_The creditors of the Existing 2026 Notes are not required to turn over any recoveries (other than_**
**_recoveries relating to the Collateral) received by them in respect of pre-existing liabilities relating to_**
**_the Existing 2026 Notes for application in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement_**

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement the pre-existing liabilities of the issuer of the Existing
2026 Notes and the members of the Group that had provided guarantees under the Existing 2026 Notes
prior to the Acquisition as of the date of the Intercreditor Agreement are treated separately from all
other liabilities of such entities and, therefore, (i) such liabilities may not be released or otherwise
compromised pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) although not permitted
to independently instruct the Security Agent, in the event that the creditors of the Existing 2026 Notes
receive any recoveries in respect of such liabilities, unless they arose from the proceeds of enforcement
of the Collateral, such recoveries are not subject to the requirement to turn over for the benefit of all
secured parties to be shared in the order of application prescribed in the Intercreditor Agreement.
Accordingly, the creditors of the Existing 2026 Notes are treated in priority to the holders of the Notes
in respect of such recoveries and by accepting the Notes, you will be deemed to have agreed to these
terms.

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the_**
**_Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor
of the security, as applicable. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with
respect to the claims under the Notes, if we fail or are unable to take the actions necessary to perfect
any of these liens. Any failure to perfect any security interest in the Collateral may result in the invalidity
of the relevant security interest or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favour of the
Notes against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security
interest in the same Collateral. The Trustee and the Security Agent will not be under any obligation or
responsibility to take any steps or action to perfect, or ensure the perfection of, any such liens.

Certain security interests on the Collateral may not be in place on the Issue Date or may not be perfected
on the Issue Date. The Indenture provides us with a 30-day period following the Issue Date to enter into
the security documents relating to the Collateral. We may not be able to perfect any such security
interests. Any issues that we are unable to resolve in connection with the delivery and recordation of
such security interests may negatively impact the value of the Collateral. The liens in the Collateral
securing the Notes and the Guarantees may not be perfected with respect to the obligations under the
Notes and the Guarantees if we are not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens
on or prior to the Issue Date. Perfection of the security interests in the Collateral after the Issue Date
increases the risk that the liens granted by those security interests become avoided or subject to the liens
of intervening creditors or intervening or existing liens.


-----

**_It is not possible to conduct lien searches in jurisdictions in which certain of the Guarantors are_**
**_located._**

It is not possible to conduct comprehensive lien searches in all the jurisdictions in which the Guarantors
are organised. As a result, no assurance can be given that there does not exist one or more liens securing
significant obligations having priority on certain of the Collateral, which liens may prevent or inhibit
the collateral agent from foreclosing on the liens securing the Notes and may impair the value of the
Collateral. For example, we cannot guarantee that information provided to us in response to company
searches with the Registrar of Companies in England for security charges against our subsidiaries
organised in England are accurate and complete because, for example, information which should have
been registered with the Registrar of Companies may not have been so registered or information that
has been lodged for inclusion in our English subsidiary’s file may not have been fully updated.

**_It may be difficult to realise the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances,
liens, security interests and other imperfections permitted under the Existing 2026 Indenture, the
Existing Senior Notes Indenture, the Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement or the Intercreditor
Agreement and accepted by other creditors that have the benefit of first priority security interests in the
Collateral securing the Notes, from time to time, whether on or after the date the Notes are first issued.
The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens, security interests and other
imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability
of the Security Agent to realise or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the priority ranking of
security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, amongst others, the timely
satisfaction of perfection requirements, or statutory liens.

The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated
with the realization of security interests over personal property such as the Collateral. For example, the
Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot
assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you
that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such
assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the
value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security.”_

**_The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence_**
**_of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such security_**
**_interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of the security interests to secure the Notes may create hardening or voidance periods for
such security interests in certain jurisdictions. The granting of shared security interests to secure future
permitted debt may restart or reopen such hardening or voidance periods in particular, as the Indenture
permits the release and retaking of security granted in favour of the Notes in certain circumstances
including in connection with the incurrence of future debt. The applicable hardening or voidance period
for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted
or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the
end of the respective hardening or voidance period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared
void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. See “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security.”_

The same rights also apply following the issuance of the Notes in connection with the accession of
further subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interest over their relevant
assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes, as applicable.


-----

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral, and the sale of particular assets_**
**_could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The security documents relating to the Collateral will, subject to the terms of the Existing 2026
Indenture, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Indenture, allow
the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain control over, freely operate, and collect,
invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral. So long as no acceleration event under the Senior
Facilities Agreement, the Indenture, the Existing 2026 Indenture or the Existing Senior Notes Indenture
is occurring or would result therefrom, the Issuer and the Guarantors, may, amongst other things,
without any consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the
Collateral, such as selling, factoring or otherwise disposing of Collateral and making ordinary course
cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness. Any of these activities could reduce the value of
the Collateral and consequently the amounts payable to holders of the Notes from the proceeds of any
sale of the Collateral in the case of an enforcement.

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the_**
**_Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically and under which_**
**_the Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee or_**
**_the Security Agent._**

Under a variety of circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be released
automatically, including a sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral in a transaction that does
not violate the asset sale covenant of the Indenture. The Indenture also permits us to designate one or
more restricted subsidiaries of MAL that are Guarantors as unrestricted subsidiaries. If we designate a
Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture, all of the liens on the Collateral
owned by such subsidiary and any guarantees of the Notes by such subsidiary will be released under
the Indenture, subject to certain conditions. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as such will reduce
the aggregate value of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees to the extent of liens
securing the shares of such unrestricted subsidiary or of its subsidiaries.

Under various circumstances, the Guarantee of a Guarantor will be released, including upon:

- in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, any sale, exchange, issuance, disposition or transfer (by
merger, amalgamation, consolidation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of (i) the capital
stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor, after which the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor is no
longer a restricted subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture or (ii) all or substantially all the
assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor, in each case if such sale, exchange, issuance, disposition
or transfer is made in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

- the release or discharge of the guarantee by, or direct obligation of, such Guarantor of
indebtedness under the Senior Facilities, or the release or discharge of such other guarantee or
direct obligation that resulted in the creation of such guarantee, except a discharge or release
by or as a result of payment under such guarantee or direct obligation (it being understood that
a release subject to a contingent reinstatement will constitute a release for the purposes of this
provision, and that if any such Guarantee is so reinstated, such Guarantee shall also be reinstated
to the extent that such Guarantor would then be required to provide a guarantee pursuant to the
covenant described under “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”);_

- in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, the designation of any restricted subsidiary that is a
Subsidiary Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions
of the Indenture or the occurrence of any event following which the Subsidiary Guarantor is no
longer a restricted subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;


-----

- upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Issuer or
another Guarantor or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor, in each case, in compliance with
the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

- in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event (as
defined under “Description of Notes”);

- the exercise by the Issuer of its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as
described under “Description of Notes—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the
discharge of the Issuer’s obligations under the Indenture in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture;

- in the case of MAL, if MAL ceases to be the direct parent of the Issuer, subject to the
assumption of all of the obligations of MAL under the Indenture, in each case, pursuant to
supplemental indentures or other applicable documents or instruments by the entity that directly
owns 100 per cent. of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests (as defined under “Description
_of Notes”) in the Issuer;_

- upon the delivery by such Guarantor to the Trustee of an officer’s certificate of such Guarantor
or the Issuer and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for
in the Indenture relating to such transaction or release and discharge have been complied with;

- in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, by written notice from the Issuer to the Trustee upon the
Notes achieving Investment Grade Status (as defined under “Description of Notes”);

- in the case only of the Parent Guarantee, pursuant to the provisions described under
“Description of Notes—IPO Pushdown”; or

- as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

In addition, the Collateral and the Guarantees will be subject to release upon a distressed disposal as
contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to_**
**_the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted_**
**_by local law._**

The security interests that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the obligations
of the Guarantors under the Guarantees thereof have not been, and will not be, granted directly to the
holders of the Notes but to the Security Agent, and thus the holders of the Notes will not have any
independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the security documents or to exercise any
rights or powers arising under the security documents except through the Security Agent as provided in
the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting a Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these
restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and
recourse against us in the event of a default. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.” In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests_
is subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the
Collateral are taken. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation
of certain pledged assets but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may
apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to
beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a security document are
validly secured. In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation
and perfection of security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor
Agreement provides for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favour of the Security Agent
(“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors owed to holders of the


-----

Notes under or in connection with the Indenture, as applicable (“Principal Obligations”). All or part of
the pledges and other security interests in such jurisdictions have been, or will be, granted to the Security
Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and do not, or will not, directly secure the Principal
Obligations. Under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times
in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in
respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment
in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the
security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct
security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests
except through the Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency
or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct has not been tested under
law in certain of these jurisdictions and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created
under the Parallel Debt construct are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully
challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of
such security interests in the Collateral. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations
_on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security.”_

**_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the_**
**_Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees_**
**_and the Collateral._**

The Guarantors are organised under the laws of Denmark, England and Wales, Germany, Luxembourg,
Italy and the United States. Enforcement of the obligations under a Guarantee against, and/or any
Collateral provided by, as applicable, any such Guarantor will be subject to certain defences available
to the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be. These laws and defences may include those
that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance,
liquidity maintenance or similar laws as well as regulations or defences affecting the rights of creditors
generally, particularly by limiting the amounts recoverable under the Guarantees and Collateral, as
applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder are limited to the maximum amount that can be
guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or security provider under the applicable laws of each
jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant
Guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Guarantee or Collateral
exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or security provider, or such Guarantee or Collateral would
be in breach of capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other
general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such Guarantor or security provider to
contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. See “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security.”_

**_Insolvency laws and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral, including fraudulent_**
**_conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

Our obligations under the Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors. The Guarantors are organised
under the laws of Denmark, England and Wales, Germany, Luxembourg, Italy and the United States.
The insolvency laws of these jurisdictions may not be as favourable to your interests as the laws of the
United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. Although laws differ amongst these
jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles,
insolvency laws and, in the case of the Guarantees and the Collateral, limitations on the enforceability
of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Guarantee
against a Guarantor. The court may also in certain circumstances void the Guarantee or the Collateral
where a Guarantor or security provider is close to or in the vicinity of insolvency. The following
discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes
generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent
transfer and insolvency statutes.


-----

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or security providers or the
appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Guarantees or Collateral, and intercompany
obligations generally, as fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may
permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to:

- void or invalidate or declare ineffective all or a portion of a Guarantor’s or security provider’s
obligations under its Guarantee or Collateral;

- direct that holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee or Collateral to the
relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security
provider’s creditors; and

- take other action that is detrimental to you.

If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Guarantee is found to be a fraudulent
transfer or conveyance or an improper transfer of assets or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you
that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each
Guarantor and security provider under its Guarantee and the Collateral will be limited to the amount
that will result in such Guarantee or Collateral not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper
corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what
standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability. Also, there is a
possibility that the entire Guarantee or Collateral may be set aside, in which case, the entire liability
may be extinguished.

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent or improper transfer or other applicable
principles, courts may need to make findings that, at the time the Guarantees or Collateral were issued,
a Guarantor or security provider:

- issued such Guarantee or Collateral with the intent or knowledge of hindering, delaying or
defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or
created such security after its insolvency;

- was aware of the fact that some creditors were disadvantaged over other creditors by these
actions;

- issued such Guarantee or Collateral in a situation where a prudent businessman as a shareholder
of such Guarantor would have contributed no equity to such Guarantor or security provider; or

- received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the
Guarantee or Collateral on the basis that the Guarantee or Collateral was incurred for the
Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or some
other basis and (1) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issue of the Guarantee,
or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons, (2) was engaged, or about to engage, in a
business transaction for which the Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were unreasonably
small or (3) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make
required payments as and when they would become due.

However, less stringent requirements may be provided under the laws of certain jurisdictions.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider
generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantee or
granted Collateral if:

- its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

- it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or


-----

- the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing
debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become
absolute.

In addition, the laws, regulations, declarations or other governmental measures introduced in response
to COVID-19 may have the effect of imposing a moratorium on or otherwise delaying or limiting the
ability to enforce or pursue certain remedies in respect of the Guarantees and Collateral.

Although we believe that we are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Offering and the use
of proceeds therefrom, there can be no assurance which standard a court would apply in determining
whether a Guarantor or security provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Guarantees were issued and
the Collateral was granted or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine
that a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine,
regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date its Guarantee
was issued, or Collateral was granted, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent
transfers on other grounds.

In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any other of our subsidiaries experience
financial difficulty, it may not be possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions
insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. For an
overview of the enforceability issues as they relate to the Guarantees and the Collateral, see “Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees_
_and Security” with respect to certain of the jurisdictions mentioned above._

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Guarantees or in the Collateral across_**
**_multiple jurisdictions may be difficult._**

The Notes will be issued by the Issuer, a company which is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg,
and guaranteed by the Guarantors, which are incorporated under the laws of Denmark, England and
Wales, Germany, Luxembourg, Italy and the United States. Security interests to secure the Notes and
the Guarantees will be granted in Collateral located in certain of these jurisdictions. Your rights under
the Notes and the guarantees will therefore be subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions. In the event
of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in the jurisdictions
mentioned above, in the jurisdiction of incorporation or organisation of a future guarantor, or in other
jurisdictions. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and
otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights in
multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Your rights under the Notes, the security
granted in respect of the Notes and the Guarantees will be subject to the insolvency and administrative
laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce
your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. In addition,
insolvency and administrative laws are subject to change and your rights may be impacted by any such
legal reforms.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative, examinership and other laws of the Issuer’s and
the non-U.S. Guarantors’ jurisdictions of organisation may be materially different from, or in conflict
with, each other and those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of
governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding.
The application of these laws, or any conflict amongst them, could call into question whether any
particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and collect
payment in full under the Notes and the Guarantees in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you
may receive. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security” and “Enforcement of Civil Liabilities” with respect to_
some of the jurisdictions mentioned above.


-----

Moreover, in certain jurisdictions, it is unclear whether all security interests in the Collateral gives the
Security Agent a right to prevent other creditors from foreclosing on and realizing the Collateral or
whether certain security interests only give the Security Agent and the holders of the Notes priority
(according to their rank) in the distribution of any proceeds of such realization. Accordingly, the
Security Agent and the holders of the Notes may not be able to avoid foreclosure by other creditors
(including unsecured creditors) on the Collateral. In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that
the Security Agent will serve as a common security agent for the secured parties under the Intercreditor
Agreement (collectively, the “Secured Parties”). The Security Agent will act with respect to the
Collateral only at the direction of the relevant Instructing Group (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement) and in accordance with the enforcement principles set out in the Intercreditor Agreement.
As such, all recoveries shall be turned over to the Security Agent and applied to the liabilities in respect
of the Senior Facilities prior to the Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and the Guarantors are organised or incorporated outside the United States, and their business
is substantially conducted outside the United States. Many of the directors and executive officers of the
Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of, and substantially all of their assets are located outside
of, the United States. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain
New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect
service of process within the United States on the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the
Guarantors. In addition, as substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors, their
subsidiaries and their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may
be unable to enforce against them judgments obtained in U.S. courts. Moreover, in light of recent
decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject to the
civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.

Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of foreign jurisdictions would enforce (i)
judgments of United States courts obtained against the Issuer, the Guarantors and the directors and
executive officers who are not residents of the United States predicated upon the civil liability
provisions of the United States federal and state securities laws or (ii) in original actions brought in such
foreign jurisdictions against us or such persons predicated upon the United States federal and state
securities laws.

**_The interests of our principal shareholders may be inconsistent with the interests of holders of the_**
**_Notes._**

The Consortium has, directly or indirectly, the power to affect, amongst other things, our legal and
capital structure and our day-to-day operations, as well as the ability to elect and change our
management and to approve other changes to our operations. In addition, the Consortium has control
over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and the ability to prevent any transaction that
requires the approval of shareholders regardless of whether our management believes that any such
transactions are in our own best interests. For example, the shareholders could vote to cause us to incur
additional indebtedness, to sell certain material assets or make dividends, in each case, so long as the
Existing 2026 Indenture, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture, the Indenture, the Senior Facilities
Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement so permit. The incurrence of additional or more expensive
indebtedness would increase our debt service obligations and the sale of certain assets could reduce our
ability to generate revenue, each of which could adversely affect us. In addition, for compliance with
certain restrictive covenants, we will depend upon the cooperation of our principal shareholders who
have the power to effect compliance with such covenants. The interests of the Consortium and its
affiliates could conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes, particularly if we encounter financial
difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. The Consortium may also have an interest in
pursuing divestitures, financings or other transactions that in their judgment could enhance their equity
investments, although such transactions might involve risks to holders of the Notes. The Consortium or


-----

members thereof may sell shares in JVco or otherwise syndicate or transfer their ownership interests
without being required to contribute proceeds therefrom to MAL or its subsidiaries, and such
transactions may, although significant, not constitute a change of control under the terms of the Notes.
In addition, the Consortium or its affiliates may, in the future, own businesses that directly compete
with ours or do business with us. The Consortium may also pursue via different portfolio companies
acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition
opportunities may not be available to us. So long as investment funds associated with or designated by
the Consortium continue to own a significant amount of our capital stock, the Consortium will continue
to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions.

**_The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. In addition, under_**
**_certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection_**
**_with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the tender._**

If a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, the Issuer will be required
to make an offer to purchase all the outstanding respective Notes at a price equal to 101 per cent. of the
principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but
excluding, the date of purchase. In such a situation, the Issuer may not have enough funds to pay for all
of the Notes that are tendered under any such offer. If a significant principal amount of Notes is
tendered, the Issuer will likely have to obtain financing to pay for the tendered Notes. However, the
Issuer may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A change of control may
also result in a mandatory prepayment under the Senior Facilities Agreement and agreements governing
any future indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of such indebtedness. Any failure by the
Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes upon a Change of Control Triggering Event, as defined in the
Indenture, would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default
under the Senior Facilities Agreement. In addition, the change of control provisions under the Indenture
will be different to the change of control provisions under the Existing 2026 Notes Indenture, wherein
a change of control repurchase event is triggered by certain ratings events.

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection
in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganisations, restructurings, mergers,
recapitalizations or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such
corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do,
may not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event.

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a Change of Control
Triggering Event will be deemed not to be a Change of Control Triggering Event, provided that upon
consummation thereof, a certain consolidated net leverage ratio of MAL and its restricted subsidiaries
is met.

In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90 per cent.
in aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw
such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of
the Issuer, purchases, all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or
such third party will have the right to redeem the Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in
part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of Notes. See
“Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.”

**_The term “all or substantially all” in the context of a change of control has no clearly established_**
**_meaning under relevant law and is subject to judicial interpretation such that it may not be certain_**
**_that a change of control has occurred or will occur._**

Upon the occurrence of a transaction that constitutes a Change of Control Triggering Event under the
Indenture, the Issuer will be required to make an offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes tendered.
The definition of “change of control” in the Indenture will include (with certain exceptions) a


-----

disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (taken as a
whole), to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or
_substantially all,” it has no clearly established meaning under relevant law, varies according to the facts_
and circumstances of the subject transaction and is subject to judicial interpretation. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of a person, and
therefore it may be unclear whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether
the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Certain covenants may be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in our ratings._**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes receive a
rating of Baa3 or better by Moody’s Investor Services Limited (“Moody’s”) or a rating of BBB− or
better from Standard & Poor’s Rating Services (“Standard & Poor’s”) or Fitch Ratings Ltd (“Fitch”)
and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day the following
provisions of the Indenture will not apply to the Notes:

- “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”;

- “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

- “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and
_Issuance of Disqualified and Preferred Stock”;_

- “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions
_Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”;_

- “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates”;

- “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by
_Restricted Subsidiaries”; and_

- clause (3) of the first paragraph and the entire fourth paragraph of the covenant described under
“Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or
_Substantially All Assets.”_

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the rating assigned by any such rating agency to such Notes should
subsequently decline to below Baa3 or BBB−, as applicable, the foregoing covenants will be reinstituted
as of and from the date of such rating decline. If these covenants were to be suspended, we would be
able to incur additional debt or make payments, including dividends or investments, without restrictions
under the Notes which may conflict with the interests of the holders of the Notes. There can be no
assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating will be
maintained.

**_The Indenture will not be qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the_**
**_“TIA”)._**

The Indenture with respect to the Notes offered hereby is not required to be, nor will it be, qualified
under the TIA and will not incorporate or include or be subject to any of the provisions of the TIA.
Consequently, the holders of the Notes will not be entitled to the protections provided under the TIA to
holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including those respecting preferential
collections by the Trustee or conflicting interests of the Trustee. See “Description of Notes.”

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

Because the Notes have not been, will not be, and are not required to be, registered under the U.S.
Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be offered and sold in the


-----

United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A, to non-U.S. persons outside the United
States in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to another exemption from,
or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and all other
applicable laws. These restrictions may limit the ability of investors to resell the Notes. It is the
obligation of investors in the Notes to ensure that all offers and sales of the Notes comply with
applicable securities laws. See “Notice to Investors” and “Description of Notes—Transfer and
_Exchange.”_

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes_**
**_will be limited._**

The Notes will be a new issue of securities for which there is currently no established trading market.
Accordingly, we cannot assure you as to:

- the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

- your ability to sell your Notes; or

- the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, amongst other things,
prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity of a
trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar
securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions
that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. Any such disruption
may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial
performance. The Initial Purchasers have advised that they intend to make a market in the Notes after
completing the Offering. However, they have no obligation to do so and may discontinue market making
activities at any time without notice. In addition, such market making activity will be subject to
limitations imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and other applicable laws and regulations. As a result,
there may not be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may
not be able to resell your Notes at a fair value, if at all.

**_The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Official List of the Exchange._**

Although the Issuer will agree to use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Notes listed on the
Exchange and admitted to dealing on the Official List thereof and to maintain such listing as long as
the Notes are outstanding, the Issuer cannot assure you that the Notes will become or remain listed. If
the Issuer cannot maintain the listing on the Exchange and the admission to dealing on the Official List
thereof, or if it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Issuer may cease to
make or maintain such listing on the Official List of the Exchange, provided that it will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on another “recognised
_stock exchange” (within the meaning of Section 1005 of the UK Income Tax Act 2007 and Section 69_
of the TCA), although there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Although no
assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of the Exchange
or another recognised listing exchange for comparable issuers in accordance with the Indenture, failure
to be approved for listing or the delisting of the Notes from the Official List of the Exchange or another
listing exchange in accordance with the Indenture may have a material adverse effect on a holder’s
ability to resell Notes in the secondary market.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book entry form and therefore investors must rely on the procedures_**
**_of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global registered form and held through Euroclear and
Clearstream. Interests in the Global Notes will trade in book entry form only, and Notes in definitive
registered form will be issued in exchange for book entry interests only in very limited circumstances.


-----

Owners of book entry interests are not legally owners or holders of Notes. The common depositary, or
its nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Global Notes
representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the
Global Notes representing the Notes will be made to the relevant paying agent, which will make
payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’
accounts that hold book entry interests in the Global Notes representing the Notes and credited by such
participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and
Clearstream, the Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or
other amounts to the owners of book entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book entry interest,
they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and if investors are not participants in
Euroclear and Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own
their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book entry interests will not have the direct right
to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of
the Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent
it has received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures
implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a
timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until Definitive
Registered Notes (as defined herein) are issued in respect of all book entry interests, if investors own
book entry interests, they will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures
to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise
of rights under the Notes.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may_**
**_be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies have assigned and may in the future assign credit ratings
to the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market,
additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit
rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension
or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will
remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn
entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A
suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or
more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our
financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_If the Notes are redeemed early, an investor may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a_**
**_comparable security._**

In the event that the Notes are redeemed early in accordance with “Description of Notes—Optional
_Redemption” and depending on prevailing market conditions at the time, an investor who receives_
proceeds due to such an early redemption may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a comparable
security at an effective interest rate as high as that carried by the Notes.

**_Investors in the Notes may have limited recourse against our independent auditors._**

See “Independent Auditors” for a description of the independent auditors’ reports, including language
limiting the accountants’ scope of responsibility in relation to such reports and the financial statements
to which they relate. In particular, in respect of the audit reports relating to the 2022 financial year and
the 2021 financial year, Ernst & Young LLP has stated such reports were made solely to our members
as a body and are subject to important explanations and disclaimers regarding Ernst & Young LLP’s
responsibilities, which are incorporated into the independent auditors’ reports as if set out in full and


-----

should be read to provide an understanding of the purpose of the reports, the work Ernst & Young LLP
has undertaken and the basis of its opinions. A description of the auditor’s responsibilities is provided
on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

Investors in the Notes should understand that in making these statements, Ernst & Young LLP
confirmed that it does not accept or assume any liability to parties, such as the purchasers of the Notes,
other than our members as a body, with respect to the reports and to the independent auditors’ audit
work and opinions. The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration
statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the U.S.
Securities Act or in a report filed under the U.S. Exchange Act. If a U.S. court, or any other court, were
to give effect to the language quoted above, the recourse that investors in the Notes may have against
the independent auditors based on their reports or the consolidated financial statements to which they
relate could be limited.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. An investment in the Notes denominated in a
currency other than the currency by reference to which you measure the return on your investments will
entail foreign exchange related risks due to, amongst other factors, possible significant changes in the
value of the euro relative to other relevant currencies because of economic, political or other factors
over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against other relevant currencies could cause
a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss
to you when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which you measure
the return on your investments. In addition, an investment in the Notes by U.S. investors may have
significant tax consequences. See “Tax Considerations—Certain United States Federal Income Tax
_Considerations.”_

**Overview**

We are a global leader in branded, location-based family entertainment. As of 1 April 2023, we operated
141 Attractions, 24 hotels and 6 holiday villages in 24 countries across four continents, and in the 53
weeks ended 31 December 2022, we welcomed approximately 56 million visitors to our Attractions.
We were the second largest theme park operator globally by number of visitors in 2019, according to
TEA/AECOM. We also own eight of Europe’s largest 20 theme parks by number of visitors as of 2021.
We believe we are a market leader in the United Kingdom, Northern Germany and Italy, based on total
visitor numbers in 2021 to Europe’s top 20 theme parks, with an already significant and growing
presence in the United States and the Asia Pacific region. We believe we own and/or operate a unique
portfolio of chainable iconic assets and brands, possessing strong heritage within their original markets,
as well as being globally scalable and supported by our extensive technical and creative expertise.

Our vision is to establish ourselves as the global leader in location-based entertainment. To this end, we
consider our main purpose to deliver memorable experiences to all our visitors, while maintaining a
strategy aimed at creating a high growth, high return, family entertainment business, naturally balanced
against the pressures of the macroeconomic environment in which we operate. We possess a unique
portfolio of family entertainment brands and iconic assets, which are highly diversified across
geography, attraction type, brand and customer demographic and well balanced between indoor and
outdoor Attractions and international and domestic visitation (with international and domestic visitation
measured relative to the relevant Attraction). We believe our footprint across 24 countries provides us
with a favourable platform to benefit from global growth in spending on travel and tourism, which
according to the WTTC, is forecast to increase by a CAGR of 5.1 per cent. per annum between 2023


-----

and 2033 (from $9.5 trillion to $15.5 trillion), by allowing us to attract both international tourists and
domestic visitors, and providing us with a buffer in the event of macroeconomic and currency risks.
Our operating groups offer our visitors diverse entertainment options, including both indoor Attractions
within city centres as well as outdoor theme parks offering multi day visits. In the 53 weeks ended 1
April 2023, 45 per cent. of our revenue was derived from our LEGOLAND Parks and 22 per cent. of
our revenue was derived from our Resort Theme Parks operations, which are primarily organised around
outdoor activities, and 33 per cent. of our revenue was derived from our Midway Attractions operating
group, which is primarily organised around indoor activities, providing a natural hedge against weather
disruptions.

We have established a diverse portfolio of nationally and internationally recognised premium brands
focused on delivering memorable experiences to millions of visitors around the world. We generated
revenue of £2,084 million, Adjusted EBITDA of £717 million, Adjusted EBITDA (pre-IFRS 16) of
£601 million and profit before tax of £126 million in the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2023.

**Factors Affecting our Results of Operations**

**_Admissions_**

Visitor attendance levels are the primary driver of our revenue and one of the primary drivers of our
profitability. From 2020 to 2022, visitor attendance grew by a CAGR of 57.9 per cent., while from 2019
to 2022 visitor attendance grew by a CAGR of (6.3) per cent. (primarily as a result of the impact of
COVID-19 and related restrictions on the number of our visitors in 2020, compared to 2019 (which was
unaffected by COVID-19)). Most of our revenue is generated by visitors through admission fees and
commercial spend such as on food and beverages and retail opportunities.

For the 2022 financial year, visitor revenue, accommodation revenue and other revenue constituted 81
per cent., 15 per cent. and 4 per cent. of our total revenue, respectively.

Visitor attendance has historically been primarily driven by, and dependent upon, the appeal of our
Attractions, and we believe that the sustainability of visitor attendance at the Attractions is contingent
upon maintaining high visitor satisfaction levels. We measure visitor satisfaction through monitoring
guest feedback on a daily basis by both local and central monitoring teams. This process assists
management in pricing and directing capital investment and resources to improve our product offering,
including through updating and refreshing the Attractions on a regular basis. We target an overall
satisfaction level of over 90 per cent. at each of the Attractions, and most of our Attractions consistently
achieve scores above 90 per cent. Our average guest satisfaction score across our group in 2022
remained stable at 94 per cent., compared to a score of 94 per cent. in 2021. We also monitor the
propensity for our guests to recommend our Attractions, having received a “Net Promoter” score (which
measures the propensity for our guests to recommend our Attractions) of over 50 per cent. in the 2022
financial year.

Visitor attendance is also impacted by our pricing and marketing strategies. The effectiveness of these
strategies is dependent upon their alignment with the appropriate target audience, which requires
management to implement and deliver brand clarity in respect of each Attraction’s proposition. Visitor
attendance is also influenced by economic conditions, conditions of the tourism industry and external
factors beyond our control.

The factors affecting growth in visitor attendance may vary amongst our operating groups. We believe
the evolution in visitor attendance during the periods under review for the Midway Attractions,
LEGOLAND Parks and Resort Theme Parks operating groups has been driven largely by the negative
impact of COVID-19 related closures and restrictions in the 2020 financial year, while visitor
attendance in the 2021 financial year began to recover, benefiting from a rebound in customer demand
primarily as a result of COVID-19 restrictions easing. While a portion of our brands and certain
geographies where we operate were still impacted by COVID-19 restrictions in 2022, overall visitation


-----

and revenue continued to rise versus the prior periods as a result of robust consumer demand, elevated
revenues per visitor and the continued recovery in international tourism supporting strong trading in
North America, the United Kingdom and parts of Continental Europe. As a result, we recorded an
increase in revenue per customer in 2022, which was also driven by our enhanced revenue management,
and focus on a flexible and lower-cost operating model.

The following table sets out visitor numbers and percentage change in visitor numbers by operating
group and in total for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 financial years:

**Financial Year**

**(in millions)** **(per. cent)**

**2020** **2021** **2022** **2020-2021** **2021-2022**

**Increase/(decrease)**

Midway Attractions ........................... 12.7 16.8 28.7 32 71

LEGOLAND Parks ........................... 5.0 9.4 16.2 90 71

Resort Theme Parks ........................... 4.4 9.0 11.5 106 28

**Total Visitors ....................................** **22.1** **35.2** **56.4** **60** **60**

Visitor attendance at the Midway Attractions operating group increased by 32 per cent. from 2020 to
2021 as a result of a strong recovery from the impact of COVID-19 mandated restrictions and
lockdowns and renewed customer demand. During the 2021 financial year, we recorded positive
visitation at regional and coastal Midway attractions primarily focused on resident markets, such as our
regional LEGOLAND Discovery Centre and our SEA LIFE Centre attractions. At the same time, we
recorded a slower recovery in gateway city locations (such as London and New York) which usually
rely on a significant element of international tourist visitation and in Midway Attractions located in
regions impacted by continuing COVID-19 restrictions. In addition, visitor attendance has been
positively impacted by the opening of eight new Midway Attractions in 2021, which were all delayed
openings originally scheduled for 2020 (such Attractions included four LEGOLAND Discovery
Centres in the United States, one Madame Tussauds in Dubai, two SEA LIFE Centres in the United
States, and one Peppa Pig World of Play in the United States). Visitor attendance at our LEGOLAND
Parks also increased significantly by 90 per cent. over the same period, primarily driven by the opening
of LEGOLAND New York, with LEGOLAND Florida remaining open throughout 2021 and
LEGOLAND California and LEGOLAND Windsor recording a strong recovery in demand following
their reopening in April 2021 and the second quarter of 2021, respectively. Visitor attendance also grew
significantly at our Resort Theme Parks, as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted across Continental
Europe and the UK between the first and the second quarter of 2021, thereby enabling our sites to trade
during the main summer trading season.

Visitor attendance at the Midway Attractions operating group increased significantly by 71 per cent.
from 2021 to 2022 primarily due to continuing recovery in domestic customer demand from the impact
of COVID-19, which was supported by a steady recovery in international tourism that benefited
primarily our Attractions in gateway locations. In addition, visitor attendance has been positively
impacted by the opening of two new Midway Attractions in 2022, which included one Peppa Pig World
of Play in the Netherlands and one LEGO Discovery Centre in Belgium, as well as by the acquisition
of the COEX Aquarium in Seoul, which has been added to our SEA LIFE portfolio of Attractions. This
recorded growth was partly offset by COVID-19 related restrictions and lockdowns being still in place
in the Asia-Pacific region (particularly in China). Visitor attendance at our LEGOLAND Parks
increased by 71 per cent. during this time due to customer demand at our LEGOLAND Florida and
California resorts, with total visitor attendance at our LEGOLAND Florida Resort growing ahead of
2019 visitation figures in part due to the opening of the adjacent standalone Peppa Pig Theme Park as
a Second Gate attraction. Visitor attendance for the Resort Theme Parks increased by 28 per cent. from
2021 to 2022, due to the unhindered opening of all of our locations in the spring, thereby allowing a
full year of trading. In addition, visitor attendance at our Resort Theme Parks was positively impacted
by the combination of robust domestic demand in each location and a recovery in international tourist
visitation. For example, our Gardaland resort benefited from a rebound in domestic Italian demand


-----

combined with increased tourist flows from nearby countries, including Germany. Over the same
period, performance at our UK theme parks and our Heide park resort was mainly driven by domestic
demand. On a local level, our Gardaland resort (Italy) also benefited from the opening of the new
“JUMANJI — The Adventure” ride.

Visitor numbers, as used in this Offering Memorandum, represent the number of individual visits to an
Attraction, as measured by our admissions systems, for the period indicated. Unless otherwise specified,
visitor numbers include visitors to Attractions operated under management contracts (which, during the
periods under review, included LEGOLAND Malaysia, LEGOLAND Dubai and the recently acquired
THIS IS HOLLAND attraction in the Netherlands), in respect of which we earn revenues through
management fees rather than directly through visitor admission fees and visitors to Attractions operated
as joint ventures, which, during a portion of the periods under review, included the hotel at LEGOLAND
Dubai which opened in 2022.

**_Management of Capital Investments_**

Our success is dependent upon the appeal of the Attractions, which impacts visitor attendance and our
results of operations. Maintaining the appeal of our Attractions requires prudent capital investment in
both our Existing Estate as well as in connection with New Business Development.

In the 2022 financial year, total capital expenditure amounted to £195 million, of which £140 million
related to Existing Estate capital expenditure. See “—Capital Expenditure.”

_Existing Estate_

Part of our growth strategy is to make targeted investments to update and refresh our Existing Estate on
a regular basis. We seek to achieve this through both operating and capital expenditures that are intended
to improve product appeal and guest experience, which are key to increasing visitor attendance levels
and length of stay with the aim to improve overall guest satisfaction. Such investments include (i)
adding new rides and Attractions and improving food and beverage facilities and retail offerings, (ii)
replacing old features with new, more up to date features and (iii) general maintenance of existing
Attractions, including ensuring health and safety standards are met or exceeded.

Such investment supports increases in admission fees and commercial spend and helps drive our
revenue growth and profitability. For example, accommodation not only continues to increase the
duration of our visitors’ stay, allowing greater cross-selling opportunities and driving improved levels
of guest satisfaction, but also leads to increases in pre bookings, revenue visibility and positive working
capital. We also make capital investments to improve back office and IT efficiency. In addition, we are
increasingly deploying investments in our Existing Estate on projects developed in cooperation with
leading intellectual property owners.

The percentage of revenue invested in Existing Estate capital expenditure varies by operating group.
Midway Attractions require relatively lower capital expenditure due to the smaller scale of the
Attractions and the higher proportion of first-time tourist visitors while Resort Theme Parks, and to a
lesser extent LEGOLAND Parks, which target a younger age range than Resort Theme Parks, require
relatively higher capital expenditure due to the development of new rides and Attractions of significant
scale and the drive to attract repeat visitors.

We establish targeted returns for all capital expenditure incurred in respect of projects expected to make
a positive contribution to EBITDA, and we build these targeted returns into our annual budgets. While
it is not possible to accurately ascertain returns for individual investments, we believe that the launch
of new features at the Attractions following capital investments are a key contributing factor in
increasing visitor attendance numbers, particularly during the year of launch.

In the 2022 financial year, our significant capital investments in the Resort Theme Parks included the
opening of the “JUMANJI — The Adventure” ride at our Gardaland Resort in Italy, pursuant to a multi

-----

territory exclusivity agreement with Sony Pictures Entertainment. In the Midway Attractions operating
group, we made significant capital investments including the acquisition of the COEX Aquarium in
Seoul, which has been added to our SEA LIFE portfolio consistently with our strategy to enhance
clusters of indoor Midway Attractions in key gateway cities. In December 2022 we also acquired the
operations and brand licence of Cadbury World (a popular attraction in the UK) pursuant to an exclusive
partnership with Mondelēz International, thereby deepening our relationship with a leading UK
chocolate brand. As part of the agreement, we will be responsible for the day-to-day running of the
Cadbury World site, its employees, and all operational decisions, as well as holding brand usage rights
for Cadbury World.

In the 2021 financial year, we made significant capital investments in the Midway Attractions operating
group, which included two SEA LIFE centres located in San Antonio and New Jersey in the USA, one
Madame Tussauds attraction in Dubai and one Peppa Pig World of Play in Chicago. Over the same
period, with respect to the LEGOLAND Parks, we have made significant investments in new
Attractions such as the LEGOLAND Korea and LEGOLAND New York parks.

In the 2020 financial year, we made significant capital investments in the development new
LEGOLAND parks, specifically LEGOLAND New York and LEGOLAND Korea.

Our Existing Estate capital expenditure was 12 per cent., 6 per cent. and 7 per cent. of revenue in the
2020, 2021 and 2022 financial years, respectively. We generally fund our Existing Estate capital
expenditure from our operating free cash flow and we expect to continue to do so going forward.

In respect of the Midway Attractions, we aim to consistently update and refresh our entertainment
offerings through the rotation of themed exhibitions across the SEA LIFE Centres; the annual addition
of new wax figures at each Madame Tussauds Attraction; the addition of a new ride, feature or new 4
D film at each LEGOLAND Discovery Centre approximately once every five years; and the regular
introduction of new story lines at The Dungeons sites. Additionally, we expect to periodically undertake
a refurbishment of the capsules of the London Eye, which takes three to four years to complete, in order
to update and improve the visitor experience. The last capsule refurbishment was completed between
the 2008 and 2012 financial years at a cost of approximately £13 million in aggregate.

Historically, capital investments have been managed in cycles and through an organized deployment,
generally determined based on periodic low, medium and high levels of investment, for each individual
Attraction across our business. We benefit from an ability to defer capital expenditure, which when
combined with an efficient net working capital profile and increased cash flow visibility from pre
bookings and our accommodation strategy, supports sustainable cash flow conversion.

We intend to continue maintaining the existing standards of general maintenance and commitments to
ensure health and safety standards and making strategic, value accretive investments in our Existing
Estate.

Our planned capital expenditure programme was reduced during the periods impacted by the COVID19 pandemic (excluding expenditure on LEGOLAND New York and LEGOLAND Korea). In the 2020,
2021 and 2022 financial years, our planned capital expenditure focused on concluding current projects,
essential maintenance and infrastructure work in our Existing Estate portfolio. As of the date of this
Offering Memorandum, we expect our capital expenditure for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2023,
to be higher than that incurred in the 2022 financial year mainly as a result of a reduced impact from
the COVID-19 pandemic on our planned capital expenditure programme. See “Forward-Looking
_Statements.”_

_New Business Development_

We also focus on a New Business Development programme to drive strategic growth. This programme
includes, amongst others, adding visitor attractions that are located next to Theme Parks and for which


-----

additional admission fees are charged, referred to as Second Gate attractions and improving and
expanding accommodation facilities and opening new LEGOLAND Parks and Midway Attractions.

In the 2022 financial year, our New Business Development capital expenditure was £55 million, which
decreased from £219 million in 2021. Spend on New Business Development in the 2022 financial year
primarily included £33 million related to the development of our LEGOLAND parks and, primarily,
LEGOLAND Korea, which opened during the period. In addition, spend on New Business
Development in the 2022 financial year included £6 million related to the development of new
accommodation across our Theme Park Resorts, £7 million related to new Midway Attractions and £9
million in connection with other investment projects.

**_Roll out of Midway Attractions_**

Our business development and growth strategy has historically involved the roll out of Midway
Attractions in new locations and countries. The costs we incur to roll out a new site and the anticipated
maturity profile of each new site vary by brand.

In Q1 2023, and the 2021 and 2022 financial years we opened 12 new Midway Attractions, as set out
in the following table (no Midway Attractions were opened in the 2020 financial year, as a result of the
outbreak of COVID-19, and scheduled openings for 2020 were delayed to 2021):

________________________________________

(1) Represents New Business Development capital expenditure spent on Midway Attractions during the respective financial period.

Accordingly, amounts presented may not be attributable to each of, or only, the Attractions opened in that period, as Attractions may be
expected to open in subsequent periods.

In 2021, we opened four LEGOLAND Discovery Centres, which comprised two locations in the USA
(San Francisco Bay Area, and New Jersey), one location in the Netherlands and one in Hong Kong. In
addition, we strengthened our USA footprint by opening two SEA LIFE Centres in San Antonio and
New Jersey, along with a Peppa Pig World of Play attraction in Chicago. We also opened one Madame
Tussauds attraction in Dubai (UAE). In 2022, we opened a Peppa Pig World of Play in the Netherlands
and a LEGO Discovery Centre in Brussels (Belgium). The development costs on each of these sites
varies depending on the nature and size of the Attraction. For example, Peppa Pig World of Play
Attractions require less capital investment, reflecting the size and the nature of the Attraction.

In connection with the Midway Attractions that we have recently rolled out, we strategically created
“clusters,” developing multiple Attractions in one city or region to capitalise on costs, cross-selling and
marketing opportunities. Clustering Attractions also allows us to achieve logistical benefits, including
the sharing of management and administrative functions across Attractions and, in some cases, the
sharing of premises, which helps reduce costs and improve EBITDA margins.

**_Development of LEGOLAND Parks_**

Another significant factor affecting our results of operations is the development of new LEGOLAND
Parks. Our LEGOLAND Parks are operated under one of our three operating models: (i) “owned and
_operated,” (ii) “leased and operated” and (iii) “manage and operate” under management contracts. Of_
the parks currently in operation, five are “owned and operated,” two, LEGOLAND Malaysia and
LEGOLAND Dubai, are operated under a management contract, and one, LEGOLAND Japan, is
operated under our “leased and operated” model.

We opened LEGOLAND Florida, the first LEGOLAND Park launched under our ownership, in
October 2011. LEGOLAND Florida is owned and operated by us, with admissions fees reflected
directly in revenues for the LEGOLAND Parks operating group.

LEGOLAND Malaysia opened in September 2012 and is managed by us pursuant to a management
contract with Malaysian partners. The resort was developed with funds provided by the Malaysian
government. As part of an agreement for the development and operation of LEGOLAND Malaysia, we
contributed fees earned during the development and operating phase back to IDR Resorts Sdn. Bhd.
(“IDR”) which, together with its subsidiaries, owns LEGOLAND Malaysia until we held 20 per cent.
of the share capital in IDR. That level has been reached and thus we own 20 per cent. of the company
that owns the park and no longer contribute management fees to IDR. We believe this operating model
enables us to enter certain new markets, while reducing our risk in those markets. Under the
management contract model, we typically receive development and management fees in return for the
provision of design, construction and ongoing operational management services; however, we do not
own the underlying assets or fund the site’s capital expenditure requirements. The management fee is
included in revenues for the LEGOLAND Parks operating group. We have an agreement with LL
Theme Parks LLC, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of DXB Entertainments, to operate
LEGOLAND Dubai under this management contract model, with no investment in equity.
LEGOLAND Dubai opened in 2016.

We opened a LEGOLAND Park in Nagoya, Japan in 2017, developed under our “leased and operated”
model, whereby we invested in the park with a partner from which we lease unowned assets in exchange
for rent. Under this model, we invested approximately one third of the total park development
expenditure, with the balance of the assets, primarily park infrastructure assets, owned by one of
KIRKBI’s subsidiaries and funded through a combination of equity and external debt provided by
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. We lease the park and associated assets on arm’s length
commercial terms, paying a turnover based rent with an annual floor on a 50 year lease. See “Certain
_Relationships and Related Party Transactions.” During the 2018 financial year, we opened SEA LIFE_
Nagoya, as well as a 252 room hotel at LEGOLAND Japan.

In 2021, we opened LEGOLAND New York while in 2022 we opened LEGOLAND Korea (with
support from the local province). Both LEGOLAND New York and LEGOLAND Korea are fully
owned and operated by us, consistent with all our U.S. and European LEGOLAND Parks.

In addition, we have also identified tangible opportunities to open new LEGOLAND Parks in China
with a focus on operating these parks under management contracts. We have entered into discussions
and agreements with the local governments and private parties with respect to these development
projects. See “Business—Material Contracts.” In addition, we are also developing three LEGOLAND
Parks in China in cooperation with local partners. Each of LEGOLAND Sichuan resort, LEGOLAND
Shanghai resort and LEGOLAND Shenzhen resort is expected to open during or after 2025. All three
will be operated under a management contract model. Capital expenditure for such LEGOLAND
projects is generally not incurred by us directly, but rather by our local partners. For example, the capital
expenditure related to our LEGOLAND Shenzhen and LEGOLAND Sichuan resorts are incurred by
our local partners, while the capital expenditure related to the LEGOLAND Shanghai resort is incurred
by a joint venture in which we are a minority investor. We intend to consider LEGOLAND Park


-----

development opportunities and the operating models for these opportunities on a case by case basis in
light of our strategic objectives.

**_Development of New Resort Hotels and Other Accommodation Facilities_**

Besides contributing to overall revenues through direct accommodation fees, our hotels and holiday
villages are a key component of our strategy of transforming our LEGOLAND Parks and Resort Theme
Parks into destination resorts to attract a broader customer base and encourage multi day visits, thereby
increasing overall visitor attendance and satisfaction while reducing the impact of short term weather
conditions. Accommodation also allows greater cross-selling opportunities and leads to increases in pre
bookings, revenue visibility and positive working capital. During the 2020, 2021 and 2022 financial
years, we launched a total of five new accommodation developments.

During 2020, we opened a 150 room accommodation offering at LEGOLAND Florida.

During 2021, we opened a 250 room resort at LEGOLAND New York.

During 2022, we increased our accommodation offering, by adding 476 new rooms through the opening
of a 250 room hotel at LEGOLAND Dubai, in partnership with the park’s owners, a 154 room hotel at
LEGOLAND Korea, and a 72 room extension to the holiday village at LEGOLAND Germany. Over
the same period, we closed 24 of our rooms at LEGOLAND Germany.

Our aggregate room capacity was over 5,300 rooms as of 1 April 2023. Room capacity within our
LEGOLAND Parks and Resort Theme Parks operating groups was 3,433 and 1,909, respectively as of
1 April 2023.

**_Strategic Acquisitions and Disposals_**

In addition to the roll out and development of new Attractions, our revenue growth and profitability are
affected by strategic acquisitions and disposals. During the periods under review, we acquired the
operations and brand licence of Cadbury World (a popular attraction in the UK) pursuant to an exclusive
partnership with Mondelēz International, thereby deepening our relationship with a leading UK
chocolate brand. As part of the agreement, we will be responsible for the day-to-day running of the
Cadbury World site, its employees, and all operational decisions, as well as holding brand usage rights
for Cadbury World. We recognised a total consideration of £8 million in connection with this
acquisition, which we expect to become payable in 2024, subject to the performance of the acquired
Attraction. We believe that the Cadbury World acquisition has enabled us to deepen our strategic
relationship with the leading UK’s chocolate brand, and will enable us to increase cross promotion and
drive visitor traffic to our Attractions. In addition, In April 2022 we completed the acquisition of the
COEX Aquarium in Seoul, South Korea by acquiring 100 per cent. of the issued share capital of Seoul
Ocean Aquarium Co., Ltd. for £31 million, net of cash acquired. In addition, as part of our overall
growth strategy, we proactively manage the composition of our portfolio and have occasionally
disposed of or closed certain of our businesses and assets to increase efficiencies, profit and cash flows
or to reduce liabilities. In addition, while we did not complete any significant disposal over the periods
under review, from time to time we may close or divest certain smaller Midway Attractions, primarily
as a result of reduced customer demand following COVID-19 or as part of our business strategy. In
particular, from 2020 through to 1 April 2023 we have closed six Midway Attractions.

**_Variations in Weather_**

Our portfolio is diversified across outdoor and indoor Attractions with 33 per cent. of our total revenue
being generated at indoor Attractions and 67 per cent. at outdoor Attractions for the 53 weeks ended 1
April 2023, and multiple geographies, which provides a degree of natural hedging against the financial
impact of certain external factors such as variations in weather. In the 2022 financial year, 46 per cent.
of our revenue was derived from our LEGOLAND Parks and 22 per cent. of our revenue was derived
from our Resort Theme Parks operations, which are primarily organised around outdoor activities, and


-----

32 per cent. of our revenue was derived from our Midway Attractions operating group, which is
primarily organised around indoor activities, mitigating the impact of adverse weather. However,
unfavourable weather and forecasts of unfavourable weather, especially during our peak opening period
and on or for weekend days, can adversely affect visitor attendance at the Attractions and, consequently,
our financial performance, particularly at our LEGOLAND and Resort Theme Parks Attractions.

The Midway Attractions operating group can also be impacted by weather conditions. Unlike our Resort
Theme Parks and our LEGOLAND Parks, almost all of our Midway Attractions are located indoors and
thus hot weather can have a negative impact on visitor numbers as potential visitors are diverted to
outdoor Attractions, such as theme parks.

In addition, mild weather may increase occupancy levels in leisure destinations, particularly during
peak travel season. Weather also typically affects our energy costs, which may increase when there are
abnormally severe weather conditions or prolonged cold or hot temperatures.

We seek to reduce the risk to our operations imposed by unfavourable weather conditions through the
use of an advance purchase pricing model for online ticket sales, providing a discount to customers who
book in advance, as well as sales of Merlin Annual Passes, Merlin Monthly Memberships and individual
Attraction season passes. We also seek to draw trade visitors, such as coach tours and school visits, to
the Attractions, and the vast majority of these trade visitors book tickets in advance. Our strategy of
transforming our Resort Theme Parks and LEGOLAND Parks into destination resorts, chiefly by the
development of accommodation facilities, further supports pre booked ticket sales by encouraging
visitors to plan multi day trips further in advance. In the 2022 financial year, approximately 79 per cent.
of our revenue from admissions was pre booked, of which 9 per cent. came through Merlin passes.

**_Seasonality_**

Our operations are subject to seasonal factors. The majority of our revenue is generated between midMarch and November due to a variety of factors affecting the northern hemisphere, where the majority
of the Attractions are located. Such factors include school holiday periods, with the longest peak during
July and August and shorter peaks during the Easter and (in the United Kingdom) October school
holiday periods, and generally favourable weather conditions. The timing of the Easter holiday each
year may affect our results of operations because when the Easter holiday occurs later in the year, it is
more likely to coincide with periods of favourable weather. In the 2022 financial year 23 per cent. of
our revenue was generated between January and April, 17 per cent. of our revenue was generated
between May and June, 38 per cent. of our revenue was generated between July and September, and 22
per cent. of our revenue was generated between October and December. These results are representative
of the effect of seasonal variation on our revenue during the periods under review. During the winter
months (November to mid-March in the northern hemisphere), our revenues have historically reduced
substantially and, in particular, our seasonal Attractions (including all of the Resort Theme Parks and
the European LEGOLAND Parks) are either closed or open for more limited hours during certain
periods. Even at the Attractions that are open year round, including LEGOLAND Florida, LEGOLAND
California and all of our Midway Attractions, attendance patterns have historically experienced
significant seasonality, driven by, amongst other factors, tourism patterns and school holidays. We
typically incur capital expenditure during the winter months (which vary depending on the location of
the Attractions) in carrying out maintenance and refurbishment work and the addition of new rides to
the Resort Theme Parks and LEGOLAND Parks.

We seek to manage our expenses to match this seasonality in revenue by the use of seasonal employees
during the peak months. Additionally, the expansion of our operations in the United States, Asia and
Australia has created some variance in peak seasons between our Attractions. This increasing
geographical diversification is a part of our growth strategy that we believe will, over time, reduce the
effects of seasonality on our business.


-----

The seasonality of our business may also, from time to time, cause our results to be affected
disproportionately by any significant “one-off” events that occur in our principal trading markets during
the peak seasons of operation. Such “one-off” events may impact particular financial years and may
make comparability across different financial years more difficult. For example, our Asia Pacific
operations were impacted by COVID-19 restrictions in the 2022 summer months.

**_COVID-19 Impact_**

The worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 and the consequent containment measures implemented
by the public authorities of the affected countries in 2020 and 2021 has had an enormous social impact
and a significant impact on general economic performance and on consumption and investments,
leading to general uncertainty. COVID-19 significantly particularly strained the entertainment industry
due to travel restrictions and stay-at-home directives in place at various times during 2020 and 2021,
resulting in widespread disruptions and significantly reduced travel around the world. The reduction in
travel resulted in the complete and partial suspensions of our operations in many of the areas where our
Attractions are located, including the closure of the overwhelming majority of our Attractions for
protracted periods of time in 2020 and in 2021. As such, the COVID-19 pandemic had a material impact
on our results for the 2020 and 2021 financial years. As a result of the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on our results of operations for the 2020 financial year and the 2021 financial year, the
comparability of our results for the periods under review (particularly for the 2021 financial year
compared to the 2020 financial year), with the relevant corresponding periods and the comparability
with future periods may also be limited.

Following the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, we timely adopted all necessary prevention, control and
containment measures throughout our global operations. In addition, we rapidly implemented additional
measures including a tight management of cash outflows in the form of operating cost and cash control,
as well as cost cutting and cash savings measures, which included access to employee furlough schemes.
At the same time, in April 2020 we secured €500 million of additional liquidity through the issuance of
the 2025 Notes. Despite the deployment of these measures, COVID-19 negatively impacted our
performance in 2020, with our revenues decreasing significantly compared to our revenues in 2019.
While we also experienced impacts from COVID-19 related restrictions and lockdowns in 2021, over
the same period our revenues increased compared to 2020 as a result of a recovery in customer demand
(particularly on a domestic scale). Our trading performance further recovered through the 2022 financial
year, as a result of governmental restrictions being lifted in key geographical areas such as North
America, the UK and Continental Europe, which allowed an increasing number of our Attractions to
operate for a higher number of trading days compared to 2021. Over the course of 2022, we also
benefited from a recovery in international tourism (particularly at Attractions in key tourist hubs such
as London and New York).

We believe that our business has demonstrated resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic, with each
of our operating groups recording a robust recovery following the easing of restrictions.

**_Macroeconomic Conditions_**

As an operator of leisure attractions, our success depends to an extent on discretionary consumer
spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary
income. Low economic growth in many of the countries in which we operate, coupled with future
economic uncertainty, has had and continues to have an adverse effect on consumers’ discretionary
spending and consumer confidence.

Our results of operations and financial condition are also impacted by other global macroeconomic
factors such as the prevailing market interest rates, consumer spending and consumer confidence,
overall inflation levels and energy costs. In particular, increases in interest rates, which are determined
and controlled by central banks in response to macroeconomic events (including the recent February
2023, March 2023 and May 2023 increases by the European Central Bank), may negatively affect


-----

general economic growth in the countries in which we operate and, consequently, could have a negative
impact on customer demand as well as our financing costs. On the other hand, inflation surges and the
increase in energy costs may have a negative impact on our cost base and overall profitability levels. In
addition, global economic conditions may also be impacted by continued adverse developments in the
banking and financial services industry. In March 2023, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank were
closed by regulators in the United States following liquidity concerns. In Europe, Credit Suisse came
close to a collapse in March 2023, which led to UBS agreeing to acquire its business, following the
intervention of Swiss regulatory authorities. Increasing pressure on U.S. regional banks has continued,
leading to the announcement by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on May 1, 2023, that First
Republic Bank, a California based regional bank, would be taken over by JPMorgan Chase. While we
have no material exposure to these institutions, there is no guarantee that other financial institutions will
not experience similar liquidity issues in the near future, or that actions taken by government authorities
to mitigate these risks will be sufficient to ensure access to our cash deposits and sources of liquidity.
In addition, there can be no assurance that there will not be additional bank failures or issues in the
broader financial system, which may have an impact on the broader capital markets and, in turn, our
ability to access those markets. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Market and Industry—
_Economic conditions beyond our control could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.”_

In addition, while our operations are not directly impacted by the war in Ukraine, such conflict has
contributed to an increase in energy costs and could cause sustained inflationary pressures if not
concluded in the short term. The cost-of-living crisis, driven by high levels of inflation, has the potential
to impact demand and consumer choices. However, our business has historically demonstrated
resilience during periods of economic slowdown. We believe our resilience in adverse economic
conditions is due to, amongst other reasons, consumer spending on family visitor Attractions tending to
be more resistant to cutbacks than many other forms of discretionary spending during periods of
economic downturn. Additionally, the Attractions may represent a less expensive holiday or leisure
alternative compared to overseas travel holidays for domestic customers in the countries in which we
operate.

Following the UK referendum on Brexit in June 2016, sterling weakened considerably relative to other
world currencies. As 65, 64 and 70 per cent. of our revenue in the 2020, 2021 and 2022 financial years,
respectively, was derived from other countries, notably the United States and Continental Europe, we
saw positive translation effects that benefitted our results for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 financial years.
In the medium term, we believe a more competitive pound could increase in bound tourism to London
and drive more “staycations” on the part of UK residents. In 2021, due to a limited recovery in
international tourism we benefited from a “staycation” effect of domestic customers that supported our
revenue recovery.

Notwithstanding this general resilience to economic downturns, significant macroeconomic events in
the countries in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our performance, and unemployment
may also play a significant role in the level of discretionary consumer spending and, in particular, the
unemployment level amongst our target demographics may affect visitor attendance levels and revenues
at certain Attractions.

**_Geographical Expansion and Diversification_**

One of our key strategies is geographical expansion and diversification. We believe we own and operate
a unique portfolio of chainable iconic assets and brands, which possess a strong heritage within their
original markets, and which are globally scalable and supported by our extensive technical and creative
expertise. Our success implementing this strategy is a key driver of our growth and financial
performance. The geographic scope of our business has expanded significantly since our inception, and
now includes a portfolio of Attractions across Europe, North America and the Asia Pacific region.
Expanding into new cities and countries allows us to continually increase the number of Attractions in
our portfolio, which in turn helps to increase visitor numbers and revenues. This also provides us with


-----

some opportunities to create “clusters,” developing multiple Attractions in one city or region to
capitalise on operational, marketing and cross-selling advantages.

**_Geographical diversification can also reduce the effects of seasonality. With Attractions in different_**
**_cities, countries and hemispheres, there is some variance in peak seasons between Attractions._**

The Asia Pacific region, in particular, represents an area of increasing strategic focus for us, with a
growing number of Midway Attractions and LEGOLAND Parks located in the region. In 2022, we have
opened LEGOLAND Korea, and completed the acquisition of the COEX Aquarium in Seoul (South
Korea), which has been added to our SEA LIFE portfolio. As of 1 April 2023, we operated 39
Attractions in nine countries across the Asia Pacific region. In addition, we are also developing three
LEGOLAND Parks in China in cooperation with local partners. Each of LEGOLAND Sichuan resort,
LEGOLAND Shanghai resort and LEGOLAND Shenzhen resort is expected to open during or after
2025. All three will be operated under our management contract model. At the same time, we are also
considering to strengthen our footprint with the opening of additional Midway Attractions throughout
the region. For further information, see “—Development of LEGOLAND Parks.”

Geographical diversification also provides us with a degree of natural hedging against certain external
factors, such as variations in weather, localised economic downturns and other localised events that
may have a temporary or sustained impact on visitor numbers at particular Attractions.

This geographical expansion and diversification requires careful strategic planning and active
management as we enter jurisdictions with different legal, political and economic circumstances, such
as Madame Tussauds Dubai, which we opened in 2021. We may enter a new jurisdiction in multiple
ways. In addition to launching new sites on our own, we may enter a new jurisdiction by acquiring and
rebranding existing leisure attractions, as demonstrated by our acquisitions of the Sydney Attractions
Group and Living and Leisure Australia, or by entering into partnership with local governments or third
parties, as reflected by LEGOLAND Malaysia, LEGOLAND Dubai and LEGOLAND Korea. We
consider entering into new jurisdictions, including the method of entering into such jurisdictions, on a
case by case basis in light of our strategic objectives.

**_Volume and Yield Strategies_**

Although visitor volumes are the primary driver of our revenue growth and profitability, profitability is
also a function of the admissions revenue per capita. We define “admissions revenue per capita” as the
amount of revenue each visitor provides by way of admission fees. Admissions revenue per capita is a
function of the lead price (being the full price for visitors), excluding VAT and other sales taxes, and
any promotional discounts we provide. To maximise total revenue and profit, we continuously monitor
both visitor volumes and admissions yield, being the admissions revenue per capita divided by the lead
price, for each of the Attractions. Our revenue per capita has increased from approximately £20 to £22
for each of the 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 financial years to approximately £29 to £30 in each of the
2021 and 2022 financial years, and represents a key driver of our profitability. Rising revenue per capita
also allow us to pass increased costs to our visitors, as we benefit from a cost pass-through capability
across our operating groups.

Decisions about volume and yield strategies for each Attraction are made weekly, monthly, quarterly
and annually by central and local management. In making these decisions, management seeks to
respond to changing patterns of demand, taking into account a wide variety of factors, including
prevailing economic circumstances, the time of year, the age of an Attractions and the Attractions’
propositions, customer ratings of “value for money” and target audience. Both volume and yield
strategies rely on our ability to implement effective pricing and marketing strategies.

We can achieve higher volumes for an individual Attraction through the use of entry promotions and
admission fee discounts, including national promotions and marketing campaigns in conjunction with
partners. We can use such promotions and discounts to distribute visitor attendance across an


-----

Attraction’s opening hours or opening period. For example, we may offer discounts for off peak times
of day or off peak days, thereby improving visitor volumes during those times. We may also use
promotions to help establish Attractions in local markets, typically using promotions in the second year
after opening once the initial heightened visitor volumes associated with a new launch have subsided.

We can also affect the admissions revenue per capita for an individual Attraction by incrementally
increasing an Attraction’s lead price and/or changing the quantum or level of discounts offered in
respect of an Attraction’s admission fee. We seek to increase revenue and profit generated during an
Attraction’s periods of peak demand and by high demand Attractions by increasing the admissions
revenue per capita during those periods and for those Attractions.

Similar to decisions about volume and yield strategies for individual Attractions, decisions about
volume and yield strategies for Merlin Annual Passes, Merlin Monthly Memberships and individual
Attraction seasonal passes are made regularly by central management to respond to changing patterns
of demand and use.

In addition, in 2022 we have deployed several revenue management initiatives primarily focused on
supporting and growing our revenues per capita which, combined with recovering visitation rates, has
contributed to driving our revenue growth and Adjusted EBITDA performance over the same period.
These initiatives included, among others, a reduction of the overall number of days on which certain
discounts were available to our visitors, which has contributed to an increase in our revenue per capita
for the 2022 financial year.

**_Impact of the 53rd Week in the 2022 Financial Year_**

The 2022 financial year was a 53-week financial period. The impact of the 53rd week on the key income
statement lines was as follows:

**Other Financial Information:**

Visitor numbers ........................................................................................ 55.1 1.3 56.4

**_Impact of Exchange Rates_**

Our presentational currency is pounds sterling, but our operations outside the United Kingdom use
currencies other than pounds sterling, principally the euro, the Danish Kroner and the U.S. dollar, as
well as other currencies including the Australian dollar, the Japanese Yen, the New Zealand dollar, the
Canadian dollar, the South Korean Won and other various currencies in Asia. For example, in the 2022
financial year, 30 per cent. of our revenue was generated in pounds sterling, 23 per cent. in euro and
Danish Kroner and 35 per cent. in U.S. dollars. Our financial performance is therefore subject to
fluctuations as a result of foreign currency exchange rate movements whenever financial information is
translated from non-pounds sterling currencies. For example, in the second half of 2022, the pound
sterling experienced a material weakening against other currencies, particularly the U.S. Dollar. As a
result, our performance positively impacted by a translation of our U.S. dollars revenues into pound
sterling. Retranslating 2022 financial year performance at 2021 financial rates would have resulted in a
£59 million decrease in revenue and a £23 million decrease in EBITDA.


-----

To eliminate the impact of foreign exchange movements on our reported revenue and EBITDA,
management uses revenue and EBITDA on a constant currency basis to evaluate business performance.
We also seek to structure our indebtedness in currencies that help reduce translational foreign exchange
exposure by drawing debt denominated in our major currencies of operation.

In addition to the translational impact of exchange rate fluctuations, we are exposed to transactional
exchange rate risk. Certain operating expenses and capital expenditures are from time to time
denominated in foreign currencies, though in general, most payments and revenues are denominated in
the same local currencies used in the countries in which we have Attractions. Additionally, we seek to
limit our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations through the use of derivative instruments under an
approved control framework. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Hedging
_Agreements” and “—Disclosure about Market and Credit Risks—Currency Risk” for a further_
description of our foreign currency hedging activities and certain risks related thereto.

**_Staff Expenses and Other Operating Expenses_**

Staff expenses represent the largest portion of our operating expenses. Staff expenses include
compensation and benefits for our employees and change over time based on changes in the number of
personnel employed and the compensation level per employee. Our staff expenses for the 2020 financial
year were £304 million and for the 2021 financial year were £374 million. Total staff expenses for the
2022 financial year were £536 million. Staff expenses as a percentage of revenues were 30 per cent. in
the 2021 financial year and 27 per cent. in the 2022 financial year, having decreased primarily as a
result of increasing revenues primarily driven by the re-opening of existing Attractions as a result of a
recovery from COVID-19 and the roll out and development of new Attractions.

Due to the seasonality of our business, employee headcount varies significantly throughout the year.
We manage our employment costs by optimizing our fixed-time and part-time workforce, also based
on flexible (including hourly) agreements that are highly variable. For example, we hire a substantial
number of workers on a flexible, seasonal basis, which is typical for operators of seasonal attractions in
the leisure industry. Depending on the Attraction, and subject to the relevant laws and regulations of
the jurisdiction in which the Attraction is located, seasonal employees are hired for the entire summer
season or on a periodic basis, in each case with flexible arrangements, enabling us to vary the hours
worked as we deem necessary. Although the use of seasonal employees provides us with a certain
amount of flexibility on our cost base, our ability to make substantial savings through headcount
reduction of seasonal employees during the opening period may be constrained by the limited advance
visibility of visitor numbers and for some Attractions, such as Gardaland Resort, certain restrictions
imposed by local employment laws.

In addition, as other businesses operating in the leisure and hospitality industry, we continue to
experience employment cost pressures in a number of locations, primarily as a result of increases in
minimum wages and tight labour markets combined with high vacancy levels since the easing of the
COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the increased minimum wages and tight labour conditions we have
and we continue to focus on ways to improve our operational efficiency, including greater use of an
appropriate full-time/part time mix in each Attraction, and in common with many businesses in the
leisure and hospitality industry, we will seek to pass on elements of the cost increase to customers in
the form of higher charges. Most recently, our staff expenses have increased due to our efforts to service
a strong recovery in customer demand and to allow the opening of our Attractions further to COVID19 restrictions being lifted. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Market and Our Business—
_Increased costs of labour, work stoppages and other labour problems, and the seasonal nature of our_
_workforce may negatively impact our results of operations.”_

Our average number of permanent employees for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 financial years was 8,449,
8,367 and 11,954, respectively. Our average number of total employees, which also include seasonal or
temporary employees, for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 financial years 18,521, 17,672 and 21,214,
respectively.


-----

During 2022, increasing inflation has driven an increase in wholesale energy prices (particularly across
the UK and Continental Europe). We experienced an impact below the level of overall energy prices in
2022 due to a combination of forward contracts and government support packages. While we maintain
robust procurement processes allowing us to tactically build a hedged forward position for our energy
requirements, the energy contracts we renewed in 2022 and 2023 have resulted in significant price
increases while government support packages have largely been removed. This may in turn drive a
significant increase in our energy costs compared to our long-term historic average. While utilities costs
do not represent a significant portion of our cost base, and amounted to 3 per cent. of revenues for the
2022 financial year, as additional energy contracts expire and need to undergo a renewal process, we
may become subject to a greater impact from increased energy prices.

**_Hedging of Interest Rate and Currency Exposures_**

We hold derivative financial instruments primarily to hedge our interest rate and foreign currency
exposures. In general, we endeavour to implement hedging arrangements that will qualify for hedge
accounting treatment, but we are not always able to do so. To the extent we hold hedges that do not
qualify for hedge accounting treatment, we determine the fair value of those hedges at the end of each
accounting period and recognise the changes in fair value as finance income or finance cost. See note
5.3 to the audited consolidated financial statements for the 2020 and 2022 financial years, and note 4.3
to the audited consolidated financial statements for the 2021 financial year, included elsewhere in this
Offering Memorandum.

**_Impact of Leases_**

We lease and pay rent on a substantial portion of our Attractions, and the majority of our lease liabilities
are non-current lease liabilities. As of 31 December 2022, our IFRS 16 lease liabilities amounted to
£1,612 million (2021: £1,458 million) on a discounted basis. For further details, see note 5.4 to the
audited consolidated financial statements for the 2022 financial year. For a description of our principal
real estate interests and leases, see “Business—Property.”

**Additional Factors Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations**

**_COVID-19 Impact_**

The COVID-19 pandemic had a material impact on our results for the 2020 and 2021 financial years.
The comparability of our results for the periods under review (particularly for the 2021 financial year
compared to the 2020 financial year), with the relevant corresponding periods and the comparability
with future periods may also be limited, see “—Factors Affecting our Results of Operations —COVID_19 Impact.”_

**_Financial Periods_**

We prepare our financial statements on the basis of a 52 week financial period (as was the case for the
2020 and 2021 financial years) or a 53 week financial period (as was the case for the 2022 financial
year). Results for financial years that include 53 weeks are not directly comparable to results from
financial years that include 52 weeks. Accordingly, the historical results presented may not be directly
comparable to results from other financial periods.

**_The Offering_**

The Issuer will issue the Notes on the Issue Date. We estimate the gross proceeds of the Notes will be
€650 million. On or about the Issue Date, the proceeds of the Offering will be used, together with cash
on balance sheet: (i) to redeem the 2025 Notes, including paying the redemption premium thereon and
accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the redemption, (ii) maintain cash on balance sheet to repay,
redeem, repurchase (including from the open-market) or address maturities of, our other secured


-----

indebtedness, and (iii) to pay the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions. See
“Use of Proceeds.”

Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations may differ from the historical financial
condition and results of operations presented in this discussion as a result of the Offering.

**Key Components of Our Income Statement**

The key components of certain line items of our consolidated income statement are described below.

**_Revenue_**

Revenue primarily represents the amounts (excluding VAT and similar taxes) received from visitors for
admission fees and priority ride access passes, amounts generated from hotel and holiday village
operations and additional commercial spend by visitors, including food and beverages, merchandise,
souvenir photography, games, car parking and guide book sales. Revenue is also generated from private
functions and sponsorship arrangements. Revenue also includes development and management fees
received under development and management agreements for certain LEGOLAND Parks (including
with respect to the development and management of LEGOLAND Dubai, the management of
LEGOLAND Malaysia and the development of LEGOLAND Sichuan, LEGOLAND Shanghai and
LEGOLAND Shenzhen) during the periods under review. Revenue is also generated from private
functions and sponsorship arrangements.

Admissions revenue is recognised at point of entry. Revenue from the sale of Merlin Annual Passes,
Merlin Monthly Memberships, individual Attraction season passes and multi attraction tickets is
recognised by the Attraction that sold the pass and, in the case of Merlin Annual Passes, Merlin Monthly
Memberships and individual Attraction season passes, evenly over the period that the pass is valid.
Where Merlin Annual Passes for the United Kingdom have been sold through our central web store,
revenue has been allocated to the applicable Attractions visited.

In many locations across our estate, photography and game operations are operated with partners that
provide specialist knowledge under revenue sharing arrangements.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales represents variable expenses (excluding VAT and similar taxes) incurred from revenue
generating activity. The expense of food and beverages, accommodation related expenses and retail
merchandise are the principal expenses recognised in cost of sales.

Royalty payments made to the KIRKBI Group are also recognised in cost of sales. We make a royalty
payment to the KIRKBI Group for the use of the LEGOLAND trademark and ancillary use of the LEGO
trademark, content and other intellectual property rights, pursuant to the LCA. See “Business—Material
_Contracts—Intellectual Property” for further details of the LCA._

**_Staff Expenses_**

Staff expenses are the principal component of our operating expenses. Staff expenses primarily
comprise wages and salaries, social security costs and pension costs, as well as any expenses arising
from share based payments and profit related bonuses.

**_Marketing_**

Costs relating to marketing include expenditures on advertising, e commerce and in connection with
third-party promotions for our Attractions.

**_Other Operating Expenses_**


-----

Other operating expenses include repairs and maintenance, displays (including displays relating to SEA
LIFE aquariums), utilities, travel costs, office costs, insurance and IT costs.

**_Depreciation, Amortisation and Impairment_**

Depreciation, amortisation and impairment relates to the ongoing depreciation of property, plant and
equipment (“PPE”) over the estimated applicable useful lives, amortisation of intangible assets over
their applicable estimated useful lives and impairment charges where the value of such assets do not
prove to be recoverable in full. When separate components of an item of PPE have different useful lives,
those components are accounted for separately.

**_Finance Income_**

Finance income is primarily comprised of interest income, foreign exchange gains and gains on hedging
instruments, which are recognised as they accrue. Finance income also includes gains generated on the
termination of certain derivative financial instruments.

**_Finance Costs_**

Finance costs comprise the interest paid by us on our bank debt including the amortisation of financing
costs in respect of bank facilities, together with financing charges on our finance leases, foreign
exchange losses and losses on hedging instruments, which are recognised as they accrue. Finance costs
also include losses generated on the closing out of certain derivative financial instruments.

**_Taxation_**

Taxation represents the corporation tax charge or credit on our profit or loss for the year, and includes
both current and deferred taxation. Taxation is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to
items recognised directly in equity, when it is recognised through the statement of comprehensive
income.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using rates enacted or
substantively enacted in each jurisdiction at the end of the reporting period, and any adjustments in
respect of previous periods. Deferred tax is provided on certain temporary differences between the
carrying amount of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and taxation purposes at
the end of each reporting period. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner
of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using the tax rates enacted
in each jurisdiction at the end of the reporting period.

Our gross effective tax rate for any financial year is equal to total taxation divided by our consolidated
profit before tax. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Contingent Liabilities.”

(1) Other operating expenses include repairs and maintenance, displays (including SEA LIFE aquariums), utilities, travel costs, office

costs, insurance and IT costs.

(2) See “Presentation of Financial Information—Non-IFRS Financial Information,” and footnote (1) under the caption “Summary—

_Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data—Other Operating, Financial and Pro forma Financial Information”_
for a discussion as to how we define and calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as well as a discussion as to other considerations
with respect to using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance.

_Revenue_

Revenue increased by £78 million, or 31 per cent., to £325 million for Q1 2023 from £247 million in
Q1 2022. This increase was driven by robust consumer demand, elevated revenues per visitor and the
continued recovery in international tourism which supported strong trading in North America, the UK,
and in parts of Continental Europe. Our trading primarily reflected the positive performance of our
Midway Attractions and our year-round LEGOLAND resorts, as the majority of our Resort Theme
Parks and LEGOLAND parks were seasonally closed during Q1 2023. While COVID-19 restrictions
have eased on parts of our Asia Pacific footprint, trading continues to be impacted by lower levels of
outbound Chinese tourism. The ongoing recovery in visitation, combined with our targeted approach to
revenue management, continue to support revenue growth. Lastly, our reported revenue for Q1 2023 is
also favourably impacted by foreign exchange rates.

_Cost of Sales_

Cost of sales increased by £12 million, or 24 per cent., to £63 million for Q1 2023 from £51 million in
Q1 2022. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in revenue generating activities compared
to Q1 2022, which have caused an increase in variable costs relating to food and beverage consumables
and retail merchandise, partly offset by focused cost control and efficiency initiatives.

_Staff Expenses_


-----

Staff expenses increased by £23 million, or 24 per cent., to £118 million for Q1 2023 from £95 million
in Q1 2022. This increase was primarily due to employment cost pressures in several locations,
particularly resulting from wage increases driven by inflation, increases to minimum wage levels, and
tightening labour markets. In addition, share-based payment charges in respect of the Management
Share Incentive Plans implemented in late 2021 totalled £5 million in Q1 2023, an increase of £2 million
from £3 million in Q1 2022.

_Marketing_

Marketing expenses increased by £6 million, or 57 per cent., to £17 million for Q1 2023 from £11
million in Q1 2022. This increase was driven primarily by increased marketing activity and planned
phased recovery of marketing spend, returning closer to pre-pandemic levels.

_Other Operating Expenses_

Other operating expenses increased by £14 million, or 16 per cent., to £99 million for Q1 2023 from
£85 million in Q1 2022. This increase was driven by the impact on our cost base of new attractions
opened in 2022 together with increased utility costs and repairs and maintenance costs improvement
works taking place at several sites over the winter season.

_Depreciation, Amortisation and Impairment_

Depreciation, amortisation and impairment increased by £2 million, or 4 per cent., to £64 million for
Q1 2023 from £62 million in Q1 2022. This increase was driven primarily by foreign exchange
movements and the impact of new attraction openings.

_Operating Profit/(loss)_

Operating loss decreased by £21 million, or 36 per cent., to £36 million for Q1 2023 from a loss of £57
million in Q1 2022. This decrease was driven primarily by the factors discussed above.

_Finance Income_

Finance income increased by £1 million, to £1 million for Q1 2023 from £nil million in Q1 2022. This
increase was driven primarily by the combined effect of higher interest rates and higher levels of
liquidity.

_Finance Costs_

Finance costs increased by £32 million, or 53 per cent., to £92 million for Q1 2023 from £60 million in
Q1 2022. This increase was driven primarily by the combined effect of increases in interest rates on our
unhedged interest-bearing loans and borrowings, and £8 million foreign exchange losses recorded on
non-sterling internal loan structures.

_Taxation_

Taxation increased by £59 million, to a credit of £55 million for Q1 2023 from a charge of £4 million
in Q1 2022. This increase was driven primarily by the effect of an increase in the estimated effective
tax rate for Q1 2023.

_Profit/(loss) for the Period_

Loss for the period decreased by £49 million, or 40 per cent., to a loss of £72 million for Q1 2023 from
a loss of £121 million in Q1 2022. This decrease was driven primarily by the factors discussed above.


-----

_EBITDA_

EBITDA increased by £23 million, or 477 per cent., to £28 million for Q1 2023 from £5 million in Q1
2022, primarily driven by increases in revenue.

_Adjusted EBITDA_

Adjusted EBITDA increased by £25 million or 312 per cent., to £33 million for Q1 2023 from £8 million
in Q1 2022. This increase was primarily driven by the factors discussed above.

Please see “Presentation of Financial Information—Non-IFRS Financial Information,” and footnote
(2) under the caption “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data—Other
_Operating, Financial and Pro forma Financial Information” for a discussion as to how we define and_
calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as well as a discussion as to other considerations with
respect to using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance.

**_13 weeks ended 1 April 2023 Compared with 13 Weeks Ended 26 March 2022 by Operating Group_**

In Q1 2023, our Adjusted EBITDA was £33 million, of which £57 million was attributable to the
Midway Attractions operating group, £18 million was attributable to the LEGOLAND Parks operating
group and £(29) million was attributable to the Resort Theme Parks operating group. Net expenses of
£13 million in Q1 2023 and £10 million in Q1 2022, respectively, were attributable to central costs and
exceptional items. These expenses were not allocated to a specific operating group and therefore are
not included within Segment Adjusted EBITDA breakdowns presented in the tables below. Other
expense items included costs related to Merlin Magic Making, head office costs and other central costs
that have not been allocated to a specific operating group.

_Midway Attractions_

The following table sets out certain financial measures and percentage change in those items for the
Midway Attractions operating group along with the number of visitors for Q1 2022 and Q1 2023:

**Midway Attractions**


**Q1 2022** **Q1 2023**


**Increase/**

**(decrease)**


**(£ in millions except**

**visitors)** **(per cent.)**

Revenue ..................................................................................................... 109 163 49

Segment Adjusted EBITDA[(1)] ................................................................... 29 57 99

Visitors (millions) ..................................................................................... 5.1 7.3 43

______________________________

(1) Segment Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of certain other expense items, including Merlin Magic Making, head office costs
and various other costs, which cannot be directly attributed to the reportable operating groups.

Revenue from the Midway Attractions operating group increased by £54 million, or 49 per cent., to
£163 million in Q1 2023 from £109 million in Q1 2022. This increase was driven primarily by robust
revenues per visitor and domestic demand in the UK, Continental Europe, Australia and New Zealand,
supported by recovery in international tourism. In addition, our performance in Q1 2022 was impacted
by the Omicron variant of COVID-19, which drove attraction closures and the adoption of restrictions
in a number of locations. While COVID-19 restrictions have eased on parts of our Asia Pacific footprint,
our local estate continues to be impacted by lower levels of outbound Chinese tourism.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA from the Midway Attractions operating group increased by £28 million, or
99 per cent., to £57 million in Q1 2023 from £29 million in Q1 2022. This increase was driven primarily
by increased revenues which benefited from increased tourism driven by the COVID-19 recovery.


-----

_LEGOLAND Parks_

The following table sets out certain financial measures and percentage change in those items for the
LEGOLAND Parks operating group along with the number of visitors for Q1 2022 and Q1 2023:

**LEGOLAND Parks**


**Q1 2022** **Q1 2023**


**Increase/**

**(decrease)**


**(£ in millions except**

**visitors)** **(per cent.)**

Revenue ........................................................................................................ 112 136 21

Segment Adjusted EBITDA[(1)] ...................................................................... 17 18 8

Visitors (millions) ........................................................................................ 1.9 2.4 28

______________________________

(1) Segment Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of certain other expense items, including Merlin Magic Making, head office costs
and various other costs, which cannot be directly attributed to the reportable operating groups.

Revenue from the LEGOLAND Parks operating group increased by £24 million, or 21 per cent., to
£136 million in Q1 2023 from £112 million in Q1 2022. This increase was driven primarily by trading
performance at our LEGOLAND California and LEGOLAND Florida parks benefiting from 2022
trends continuing into Q1 2023, partly offset by trading at LEGOLAND California being negatively
impacted by extended periods of poor weather (which resulted in a slower start of the season). In
addition, our LEGOLAND Japan site continued through a path of accelerated sustained recovery that
commented in 2022, by recording strong trading performance in Q1 2023.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA from the LEGOLAND Parks operating group increased by £1 million, or
8 per cent., to £18 million in Q1 2023 from £17 million in Q1 2022. This increase was primarily driven
by an increase in our revenues for the period, partly offset by fixed costs of LEGOLAND Korea, which
opened in May 2022 and had only minimal fixed operating expenditure in Q1 2022.

_Resort Theme Parks_

Due to the nature and location of the Attractions in the Resort Theme Parks operating group, this
operating group is generally impacted more by seasonality than our other two operating groups. The
majority of revenue generated at the Resort Theme Parks typically occurs in the second half of each
financial year, in particular, during the peak months of July and August. Trading usually starts in the
early spring, and activities over the winter season focus on accommodation offerings and events.

The following table sets out certain financial measures and percentage change in those items for the
Resort Theme Parks along with the number of visitors for Q1 2022 and Q1 2023:

**Resort Theme Parks**


**Q1 2022** **Q1 2023**


**Increase/**

**(decrease)**


**(£ in millions except**

**visitors)** **(per cent.)**

______________________________

(1) Segment Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of certain other expense items, including Merlin Magic Making, head office costs
and various other costs, which cannot be directly attributed to the reportable operating groups.


-----

Revenue from the Resort Theme Parks operating group increased by £2 million, or 7 per cent., to £24
million in Q1 2023 from £22 million in Q1 2022. This increase was driven primarily by increased
revenues from our accommodation offerings remaining available over the winter period, with our Alton
Towers resort being the largest contributor to our Resort Theme Parks segment revenue.

Segment Adjusted EBITDA from the Resort Theme Parks operating group decreased by £1 million, or
5 per cent., to a loss of £29 million in Q1 2023 from a loss of £28 million in Q1 2022. This decrease
was driven primarily by increases in revenue for the period, partly offset by increased utility costs and
repairs and maintenance costs improvement works taking place at several sites over the winter season.

costs, insurance and IT costs, and have been offset with any government funding provided as support for operating costs.

(2) See “Presentation of Financial Information—Non-IFRS Financial Information,” and footnote (1) under the caption “Summary—
_Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data—Other Operating, Financial and Pro forma Financial Information”_
for a discussion as to how we define and calculate EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA as well as a discussion as to other
considerations with respect to using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance.

_Revenue_

Revenue increased by £745 million, or 59 per cent., to £2,006 million for the 2022 financial year from
£1,261 million in the 2021 financial year. This increase was driven by robust consumer demand,
elevated revenues per visitor and high average room rates in our accommodation portfolio, all
supporting strong trading particularly in North America, the UK and on parts of Continental Europe, as
well as a continuing post-COVID 19 recovery of international tourism (despite lower levels of outbound
Chinese tourism due to local restrictions impacting our Asia Pacific operations). In 2021 and 2022 we
also opened LEGOLAND New York and LEGOLAND Korea, respectively, two large Attractions
which contributed to revenue increases.

_Cost of Sales_

Cost of sales increased by £133 million, or 59 per cent., to £359 million for the 2022 financial year from
£226 million in the 2021 financial year. This increase was driven primarily by increased visitor


-----

revenues, requiring additional cost for food and beverage consumables and retail merchandise, together
with a growth of our accommodation portfolio.

_Staff Expenses_

Staff expenses increased by £162 million, or 43 per cent., to £536 million for the 2022 financial year
from £374 million in the 2021 financial year. This increase was driven by greater variable expenses
incurred from our revenue generating activities, combined with lower levels of governmental support
payments, which totalled £2 million received in the 2022 financial year compared to £19 million in the
2021 financial year. The financial year 2022 also includes £21 million of share-based payment
accounting charges in respect of the Management Share Incentive Plans implemented in late 2021. See
“Management—Management Share Incentive Plans.”

_Marketing_

Marketing expenses increased by £44 million, or 147 per cent., to £74 million for the 2022 financial
year from £30 million in the 2021 financial year. This increase was driven primarily by increased
marketing to support the increase in our trading levels over the same period.

_Other Operating Expenses_

Other operating expenses increased by £111 million, or 44 per cent., to £366 million for the 2022
financial year from £255 million in the 2021 financial year. This increase was driven primarily by the
combined effect of increased repairs and maintenance costs, as a result of an increase in Attractions
being open in the 2022 financial year compared to the 2021 financial year, and higher property costs in
the UK as a result of an increase in applicable business rates. Governmental support payments totalled
£33 million received in the 2022 financial year compared to £19 million received in the 2021 financial
year.

_Depreciation, Amortisation and Impairment_

Depreciation, amortisation and impairment amounted to £285 million for the 2022 financial year, an
increase of £39 million, or 16 per cent., from £246 million in the 2021 financial year. This increase was
primarily due to increased depreciation charges in respect of our recently opened Attractions
LEGOLAND New York and LEGOLAND Korea, in addition to £29 million of impairment charges
relating to two Midway Attractions and one joint venture.

_Operating Profit_

Operating profit increased by £256 million or 196 per cent., to £386 million for the 2022 financial year
from £130 million in the 2021 financial year. This increase was driven primarily by the factors discussed
above.

_Finance Income_

Finance income increased by £27 million to £29 million for the 2022 financial year from £2 million in
the 2021 financial year. Finance income in 2022 was primarily attributable to net foreign exchange
gains on non-sterling intercompany loans.

_Finance Costs_

Finance costs increased by £53 million, or 23 per cent., to £279 million for the 2022 financial year from
£226 million for the 2021 financial year. This increase was driven primarily by higher interest charges
on our financial liabilities. In addition, floating rates on interest-bearing loans and borrowings also
increased in the period, along with interest charges resulting from the extension of lease tenure at certain
Resort Theme Park locations in the 2021 and 2022 financial years.


-----

_Taxation_

Taxation slightly increased by £1 million, or 3 per cent., to £47 million for the 2022 financial year from
£46 million in the 2021 financial year. The effective tax rate in 2021 was (48.9) per cent. as a result of
the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities following corporation tax rate changes to be enacted from 1
April 2023 in the UK and the non-recognition of tax losses. The effective tax rate in 2022 was 34.6 per
cent., which was higher than the prevailing UK standard rate due primarily to the effect of tax rates in
foreign jurisdictions and certain non-deductible expenditure offset by movements in uncertain tax
provisions.

_Profit/(loss) for the Year_

Profit/(loss) for the year increased by £229 million to a profit of £89 million for the 2022 financial year
from a loss of £140 million in the 2021 financial year. This increase was primarily driven by the factors
discussed above.

_EBITDA_

EBITDA increased by £295 million, or 78 per cent., to £671 million for the 2022 financial year from
£376 million in the 2021 financial year. This increase was primarily driven by a significant increase in
our revenue for the 2022 financial year compared to the 2021 financial year.

_Adjusted EBITDA_

Adjusted EBITDA increased by £313 million, or 82 per cent., to £692 million for the 2022 financial
year from £379 million in the 2021 financial year. This increase was driven by the factors discussed
above.

Please see “Presentation of Financial Information—Non-IFRS Financial Information,” and footnote
(2) under the caption “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data—Other
_Operating, Financial and Pro forma Financial Information” for a discussion as to how we define and_

respect to using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance.

**_53 Weeks Ended 31 December 2022 Compared with 52 Weeks Ended 25 December 2021 by Operating_**
**_Group_**

In the 2022 financial year, our EBITDA was £671 million, of which £249 million was attributable to
the Midway Attractions operating group, £330 million was attributable to the LEGOLAND Parks
operating group and £157 million was attributable to the Resort Theme Parks operating group. Net
expenses of £65 million in the 2022 financial year and £46 million in the 2021 financial year,
respectively, were attributable to exceptional items and other expense items. These expenses were not
allocated to a specific operating group and therefore are not included within Segment EBITDA
breakdowns presented in the tables below. Other expense items included costs related to Merlin Magic
Making, head office costs and other central costs that have not been allocated to a specific operating
group.

_Midway Attractions_

The following table sets out certain financial measures and percentage change in those items for the
Midway Attractions operating group along with the number of visitors for the 2021 and 2022 financial
years:

______________________________

(1) Segment EBITDA excludes the impact of certain other expense items, including Merlin Magic Making, head office costs and
various other costs, which cannot be directly attributed to the reportable operating groups.

Revenue from the Midway Attractions operating group increased by £287 million, or 83 per cent., to
£631 million for the 2022 financial year from £344 million in the 2021 financial year. This increase was
driven primarily by growing revenues per guest as a result of robust consumer demand following a
recovery from COVID-19. Our North America attractions recorded total revenues ahead of prepandemic levels, as a result of an increase in revenues per guest and attraction openings. Our UK
operations also recorded positive trading, driven by strong revenues per guest and domestic demand,
supported by recovery in international tourism primarily to our attractions in London. Similar trends
have driven the performance of our Continental Europe attractions, while our Asia Pacific region was
negatively impacted by COVID-19 related restrictions in certain Asian countries (including China), and
related lower levels of outbound tourism compared to other regions.

Segment EBITDA from the Midway Attractions operating group increased by £147 million, or 144 per
cent., to £249 million for the 2022 financial year from £102 million in the 2021 financial year. This
increase was primarily driven by revenue growth.

_LEGOLAND Parks_

______________________________

(1) Segment EBITDA excludes the impact of certain other expense items, including Merlin Magic Making, head office costs and
various other costs, which cannot be directly attributed to the reportable operating groups.

Revenue from the LEGOLAND Parks operating group increased by £387 million, or 72 per cent., to
£924 million for the 2022 financial year from £537 million in the 2021 financial year. This increase was
driven by growing revenues as a result of robust consumer demand following a recovery from the
COVID-19 pandemic. Our North America sites recorded a strong trading performance, with revenues


-----

being driven by an increase in revenues per guest and higher accommodation room rates and the
annualised impact of LEGOLAND New York opened in 2021. Our sites in the UK and Continental
Europe recorded an increase in revenues, mainly due to higher revenues per guest and strong average
room rates, which also benefited from a recovery in visits by international tourists. In the Asia Pacific
region, we recorded a slower pace of recovery primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 having
remained in place in certain countries, which has partly offset positive trading by LEGOLAND Japan
and positive initial trading by our new LEGOLAND Korea site, which has opened over the same period.

Segment EBITDA from the LEGOLAND Parks operating group increased by £158 million to £330
million for the 2022 financial year from £172 million in the 2021 financial year. This increase was
driven primarily by revenue growth.

_Resort Theme Parks_

Due to the nature and location of the Attractions in the Resort Theme Parks operating group, this
operating group is generally impacted more by seasonality than our other two operating groups. The
majority of revenue generated at the Resort Theme Parks typically occurs in the second half of each
financial year, in particular, during the peak months of July and August. Trading usually starts in the
early spring, and activities over the winter season focus on accommodation offerings and events.

The following table sets out certain financial measures and percentage change in those items for the
Resort Theme Parks along with the number of visitors for the 2021 and 2022 financial years:

**Resort Theme Parks**

______________________________

(1) Segment EBITDA excludes the impact of certain other expense items, including Merlin Magic Making, head office costs and
various other costs, which cannot be directly attributed to the reportable operating groups.

Revenue from the Resort Theme Parks operating group increased by £76 million, or 20 per cent., to
£450 million for the 2022 financial year from £374 million for the 2021 financial year. This increase
was driven primarily by growing revenues resulting from strong revenues per guest and accommodation
room rates reflecting robust consumer demand, following the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
In particular, we recorded strong trading in our Gardaland and Alton Tower Resorts, which represent
the largest resorts in our Resort Theme Parks operating segment. This increase also reflects the impact
of the annualised performance of the LEGOLAND Water Park at Gardaland (which opened in 2021)
and new ride attractions launched in the year (including “JUMANJI — The Adventure” at Gardaland).

EBITDA from the Resort Theme Parks operating group increased by £9 million, or 6 per cent., to £157
million for the 2022 financial year from £148 million in the 2021 financial year. This increase was
driven primarily by revenue growth, partly offset by increasing inflationary impacts on cost areas
including repairs and maintenance, as well as increasing VAT rates in the UK.

2021. For further information, see “Presentation of Financial Information—Historical Financial Statements—Restated Financial

(3) See “Presentation of Financial Information—Non-IFRS Financial Information,” and footnote (1) under the caption “Summary—
_Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data—Other Operating, Financial and Pro forma Financial Information”_
for a discussion as to how we define and calculate EBITDA as well as a discussion as to other considerations with respect to using
EBITDA to assess our financial performance.

_Revenue_

Revenue increased by £632 million, or 101 per cent., to £1,261 million for the 2021 financial year from
£629 million in the 2020 financial year. This increase was driven by a strong recovery in customer
demand across our operations, supported by COVID-19 restrictions being gradually lifted. In North
America, the UK and Continental Europe consumer demand was particularly driven by limited options
for international travel and government support measures. This resulted in a strong recovery in visitation
and revenue per guest at our Resort Theme Parks, as well as regional and coastal Midway Attractions.
This increase in revenues was partly offset by a slower recovery of international tourism, which
impacted trading at our Midway Attractions in locations such as London and New York, as well as
performance at a portion of our European theme park Attractions relying usually on a higher element
of international tourist visitations. We also recorded slower recovery in the Asia Pacific region, as a
result of reduced domestic and regional travel due to COVID-19 related restrictions.

_Cost of Sales_

Cost of sales increased by £67 million, or 42 per cent., to £226 million for the 2021 financial year from
£159 million in the 2020 financial year. This increase was driven primarily by an increase in operating
days and trading volumes in the 2021 financial year compared to the 2020 financial year, due to
COVID-19 restrictions being gradually lifted in multiple regions.


-----

_Staff Expenses_

Staff expenses increased by £70 million, or 23 per cent., to £374 million for the 2021 financial year
from £304 million in the 2020 financial year. This increase was driven primarily by an increase in
operating days and in number of Attractions being open in the 2021 financial year, compared to the
2020 financial year, partly offset by £19 million in government support payments (including pursuant
to COVID-19 related employee furlough schemes) and by the impact of restructuring and efficiency
programmes that were initiated in 2020. Staff expenses represented 30 per cent. of our revenue in the
2021 financial year, a decrease from 48 per cent. for the 2020 financial year.

_Marketing_

Marketing expenses remained unchanged at £30 million for the 2021 financial year from £30 million
in the 2020 financial year. Marketing expenses represented 2 per cent. of our revenue in the 2021
financial year, a decrease from 5 per cent. in the 2020 financial year.

_Other Operating Expenses_

Other operating expenses decreased by £5 million, or 2 per cent., to £255 million for the 2021 financial
year from £260 million in the 2020 financial year. This decrease was partially driven by higher
exceptional operational costs relating to productivity and efficiency activities, which totalled £6 million
incurred in the 2020 financial year compared to £3 million in the 2021 financial year. These costs were
incurred in respect of IT projects. In addition, increased site costs in the 2021 financial year compared
to the 2020 financial year were offset by government support for operating costs which we received in
certain jurisdictions.

_Depreciation, Amortisation and Impairment_

Depreciation, amortisation and impairment amounted to £246 million for the 2021 financial year, a
decrease of £373 million, or 60 per cent., from £619 million in the 2020 financial year. This decrease
was primarily due to impairment charges in the 2020 financial year resulting from the impact of
COVID-19 on our trading;. The charges related to: (i) impairment charges of £260 million in respect of
goodwill associated with the LEGOLAND Parks operating group, (ii) impairment charges of £78
million in property, plant and equipment (mainly related to LEGOLAND New York, the opening of
which was delayed) and (iii) impairment charges of £14 million in respect of right-of-use assets relating
to certain Attractions.

_Operating Profit_

Operating profit increased by £873 million to a profit of £130 million for the 2021 financial year from
a loss of £743 million in the 2020 financial year. This increase was driven primarily by the factors
discussed above.

_Finance Income_

Finance income decreased by £2 million to £2 million for the 2021 financial year from £4 million in
the 2020 financial year. This decrease was driven by a decrease in bank interest income and other
interest receivables.

_Finance Costs_

Finance costs remained stable at £226 million for the 2021 financial year and £226 million for the 2020
financial year. This performance was driven by lower net foreign exchange losses recorded in the 2021
financial year, which were offset by higher interest expenses recorded over the same period compared
to the 2020 financial year, reflecting a full year of interest on the 2025 Notes, offset by lower drawings
under our Revolving Credit Facility.


-----

_Taxation_

Taxation increased by £192 million to a tax expense of £46 million for the 2021 financial year from a
tax gain of £146 million in the 2020 financial year. This increase was primarily due to a loss before tax
of £965 million recorded in the 2020 financial year, compared to a loss before tax of £94 million in the
2021 financial year.

_Loss for the Year_

Loss for the year decreased by £679 million, or 83 per cent., to a loss of £140 million for the 2021
financial year from a loss of £819 million in the 2020 financial year, as a result of the factors discussed
above.

_EBITDA_

EBITDA increased by £500 million to £376 million for the 2021 financial year from a loss of £124
million in the 2020 financial year. This increase was primarily driven by the combined effect of a
significant increase in our revenue for the 2021 financial year compared to the 2020 financial year, and
a strong focus on cost management initiatives which continued throughout 2021.

Please see “Presentation of Financial Information—Non-IFRS Financial Information,” and footnote
(2) under the caption “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data—Other
_Operating, Financial and Pro forma Financial Information” for a discussion as to how we define and_
calculate EBITDA, as well as a discussion as to other considerations with respect to using EBITDA to
assess our financial performance.

**_52 Weeks Ended 25 December 2021 Compared with the 52 Weeks Ended 26 December 2020 by_**
**_Operating Group_**

In the 2021 financial year, our EBITDA was £376 million, of which £102 million was attributable to
the Midway Attractions operating group, £172 million was attributable to the LEGOLAND Parks
operating group and £148 million was attributable to the Resort Theme Parks operating group. Net
expenses of £46 million in the 2021 financial year and £77 million in the 2020 financial year,
respectively, were attributable to exceptional items and other expense items. These expenses were not
allocated to a specific operating group and therefore are not included within Segment EBITDA
breakdowns presented in the tables below. Other expense items included costs relating to Merlin Magic
Making, head office costs and other central costs that have not been allocated to a specific operating
group.

-----

Revenue from the Midway Attractions operating group increased by £116 million, or 51 per cent., to
£344 million for the 2021 financial year from £228 million in the 2020 financial year. This increase was
driven primarily by a recovery in revenues as a result of stronger performance in regional and coastal
Midway Attractions that are primarily focused on domestic markets (for example, our LEGOLAND
Discovery Centre and SEA LIFE Centre Attractions). This increase was partly offset by slower recovery
in gateway city locations due to lower international tourist visitations and in regions with continuing
COVID-19 related restrictions.

Segment EBITDA from the Midway Attractions operating group increased by £119 million to £102
million for the 2021 financial year from a loss of £17 million in the 2020 financial year. This increase
was driven primarily by a recovery in revenue as compared to the prior period and operating cost
savings.

Revenue from the LEGOLAND Parks operating group increased by £309 million, or 135 per cent., to
£537 million for the 2021 financial year from £228 million in the 2020 financial year. This increase was
driven primarily by growing revenues as a result of robust consumer demand following a recovery from
COVID-19. Our North America sites recorded a strong recovery in demand, despite LEGOLAND
California remaining closed until April 2021 and LEGOLAND New York having opened on a phased
basis, with subsequent increases in capacity in May and June. Our sites in the UK and Continental
Europe reopened in the second quarter of 2021 and recorded a recovery in trading, as COVID-19
restrictions were gradually lifted. The recovery at our Continental Europe sites slightly lagged the
performance of our UK sites, as a result of historically greater exposure to international tourism and
greater focus of our UK businesses on domestic visitors and short breaks. In the Asia Pacific region, we
recorded a slower pace of recovery primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 restrictions remaining in
place in certain countries (for example, our LEGOLAND Malaysia site remained closed from early
May 2021 until October 2021).

Segment EBITDA from the LEGOLAND Parks operating group increased by £202 million to £172
million for the 2021 financial year from a loss of £30 million in the 2020 financial year. This increase
was driven primarily by a recovery in revenue as compared to the prior period, partly offset by increased
costs for recruiting and retaining staff, particularly in certain key-line functions.

_Resort Theme Parks_

Due to the nature and location of the Attractions in the Resort Theme Parks operating group, this
operating group is generally impacted more by seasonality than our other two operating groups. The


-----

majority of revenue generated at the Resort Theme Parks typically occurs in the second half of each
financial year, in particular, during the peak months of July and August. Trading usually starts in the
early spring, and activities over the winter season focus on accommodation offerings and events.

Revenue from the Resort Theme Parks operating group increased by £205 million, or 122 per cent., to
£374 million for the 2021 financial year from £169 million for the 2020 financial year. This increase
was driven by growing revenues as a result of strong revenues per guest and higher average room rates,
partly offset by COVID-19 related restrictions remaining in place during the first and second quarter of
2021, which delayed the main season opening of all our Resort Theme Parks.

Segment EBITDA from the Resort Theme Parks operating group increased by £148 million to £148
million for the 2021 financial year. This increase was driven by increased revenue and operating cost
savings.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Our principal sources of liquidity on an ongoing basis are our operating cash flows and financing cash
flows from drawings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Historically, the principal variations in our
borrowing requirements and our principal uses of funds have been in respect of investments in our
Existing Estate, the roll out and development of new Attractions and the acquisition of new businesses.
As of 31 December 2022, we had £266 million of cash and cash equivalents and, under our Senior
Facilities, among other facilities, a Revolving Facility in the amount of £400 million, of which £30
million is carved out as an ancillary facility.

Our business has historically been highly cash generative during our main trading period (mid-March
to November), with additional cash generation occurring in December and January with respect to
certain of our year-round Attractions and our Attractions located in the southern hemisphere. Our
revenue is primarily driven by visitor attendance at the Attractions. Receivables from trade debtors do
not constitute a significant portion of our current assets, as the majority of our customers pay either in
advance or at the time of their visit. During the winter months in the northern hemisphere, when our
seasonal Attractions (including most of the Resort Theme Parks, the European LEGOLAND Parks,
LEGOLAND New York and LEGOLAND Korea) are generally closed or have reduced opening hours
and generate substantially lower revenue than during our main trading period, we generate losses and
typically incur capital expenditure in carrying out maintenance and refurbishment work and investments
to upgrade and refresh our Existing Estate. Reflecting this seasonality, our cash low point has
historically been in May or June.

Our ability to generate operating cash flows depends on our operating performance, which in turn
depends to some extent on general economic, financial, industry, regulatory and other factors, many of


-----

which are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed in “Risk Factors.” Our operating results
in the 2020 financial year and the 2021 financial year, and in particular the first half of that year, were
affected by COVID-19, in particular due reduced trading and suppressed customer demand as a result
of COVID-19 restrictions and closures.

Following the completion of the Offering, our primary debt service obligations will consist primarily
of interest payments on the Notes, the Existing Senior Notes, the Existing 2026 Notes and borrowings
under the Senior Facilities.

As of 31 December 2022, we had £266 million of cash and cash equivalents and, under our Senior
Facilities, among other facilities, a Revolving Facility in the amount of £400 million, of which £30
million is carved out as an ancillary facility available for the purposes described above. Giving effect
to the Transactions, we would have had cash and cash equivalents of £302 million as of 1 April 2023.

We anticipate that we will be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future and our ability to generate
future financing cash flows will be limited under the Indenture, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture,
the Existing 2026 Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement, which may have important negative
consequences for you. See “Risk Factors,” “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Indebtedness” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.” In addition, any additional_
indebtedness that we do incur could reduce the amount of our cash flow available to make payments on
our then existing indebtedness, including under the Notes offered hereby, and increase our leverage.

(1) In 2021, we restated our consolidated income statement and our consolidated statement of financial position for the 2020 financial year

to give effect to (i) a change in accounting policy relating to software-as-a-service (SaaS) arrangements and (ii) the correction of certain
errors that were identified during 2021. For further information, see “Presentation of Financial Information—Historical Financial
_Statements—Restated Financial Statements.”_

_Net Cash Inflow from Operating Activities_

The primary source of our cash flow is typically funds generated by operating activities. Net cash from
operating activities primarily reflects our EBITDA, as well as working capital movements, changes in
provisions and other noncurrent liabilities and tax paid.

Net cash from operating activities in Q1 2023 amounted to a net cash inflow of £62 million, an increase
of £43 million, or 239 per cent., from a net cash inflow of £19 million in Q1 2022. This increase was
attributable to an increase in Adjusted EBITDA resulting from the COVID-19 recovery and an increase
in positive working capital movements.


-----

Net cash from operating activities in the 2022 financial year amounted to a net cash inflow of £622
million, an increase of £163 million, or 35 per cent., from a net cash inflow of £459 million in the 2021
financial year. The increase was mainly attributable to an increase in Adjusted EBITDA resulting from
the COVID-19 recovery, partly offset by higher cash tax payments and negative working capital
movements (which in the 2022 financial year were driven by the impact of one-off factors including
increased trade accounts receivable and higher inventory levels as trading recorded a positive
performance following a recovery from COVID-19, combined with lower levels of accruals).

Net cash from operating activities in the 2021 financial year amounted to a net cash inflow of £459
million, an increase of £534 million from a net cash outflow of £75 million in the 2020 financial year.
The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in EBITDA resulting from the COVID-19
recovery, compared to the 2020 financial year.

_Net Cash Outflow from Investing Activities_

Net cash outflow from investing activities primarily includes cash used for payments to acquire
businesses, net of cash acquired, capital expenditure in our Existing Estate and investment in new
Midway Attractions, new LEGOLAND Parks and new accommodation offerings, net of cash received
from proceeds on the disposal of property, plant and equipment and interest received.

Net cash outflow from investing activities in Q1 2023 amounted to a net cash outflow of £70 million,
an increase of £31 million, or 81 per cent., from a net cash outflow of £39 million in Q1 2022. The
increase was mainly attributable to increased Existing Estate capital expenditure.

Net cash outflow from investing activities in the 2022 financial year amounted to a net cash outflow of
£222 million, a decrease of £75 million, or 25 per cent., from a net cash outflow of £297 million in the
2021 financial year. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in outflows relating to the
purchase of property, plant and equipment in the 2021 financial year compared to the 2021 financial
year, partly offset by a £31 million outflow relating to the acquisition of the COEX Aquarium in Seoul,
South Korea, which has been added to our SEA LIFE portfolio.

Net cash outflow from investing activities in the 2021 financial year amounted to a net cash outflow of
£297 million, a decrease of £1 million, or less than 1 per cent., from a net cash outflow of £298 million
in the 2020 financial year. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower cash outflows relating to
the purchase of property, plant and equipment in the 2021 financial year compared to the 2020 financial
year, partly offset by a £7 million charge in the 2021 financial year primarily relating to an investment
in the LEGOLAND Shanghai Resort which is currently under development.

_Net Cash Outflow from Financing Activities_

Net cash outflow from financing activities primarily includes any form of long-term debt financing
raised or repaid and interest paid.

Net cash outflow from financing activities in Q1 2023 amounted to a net cash outflow of £66 million,
an increase of £26 million, or 65 per cent., from a net cash outflow of £40 million in Q1 2022. The
increase was mainly attributable to an increase in bank interest paid.

Net cash outflow from financing activities in the 2022 financial year amounted to a net cash outflow of
£326 million, an increase of £31 million, or 10 per cent., from a net cash outflow of £295 million in the
2021 financial year. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in interest paid due to the
inclusion of an additional quarterly interest payment in the 2022 financial year, as a result of this period
being on a 53-week basis.

Net cash outflow from financing activities in the 2021 financial year amounted to a net cash outflow of
£295 million, an increase of £790 million, from a net cash inflow of £495 million in the 2020 financial


-----

year. The decrease was primarily attributable to the issuance of the 2025 Notes in the 2020 financial
year, and to increased interest payments in the 2021 financial year.

**Capital Expenditure**

Our capital expenditure was £301 million, £291 million and £195 million for the 2020, 2021 and 2022
financial years, respectively. Existing Estate capital expenditure was £78 million, £72 million and £140
million for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 financial years, respectively, returning to a normalised level in
2022 following periods of suppressed spending in 2020 and 2021 (which were impacted by lower
activity due to the COVID-19 outbreak). New Business Development capital expenditure was £223
million, £219 million and £55 million for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 financial years, respectively, having
decreased as a result of the completion of the LEGOLAND New York and LEGOLAND Korea
construction projects. New Business Development capital expenditure in the 2022 financial year
included (i) £33 million relating to the development of LEGOLAND parks, primarily LEGOLAND
Korea, (ii) £6 million relating to new accommodation development across our Theme Park resorts, (iii)
£7 million relating to the deployment of new Midway Attractions and (iv) £9 million relating to
additional projects, including our second Peppa Pig theme park expected to open in the Dallas/Fort
Worth area in 2024.

We continuously plan expenditure for the development of our estate, both in respect of (i) upgrading
and refreshing our Existing Estate and (ii) new business. Our capital expenditure relating to the
development of new business is primarily focused on the roll out of Attractions into new locations and
countries, including the development of Second Gate attractions, up selling our existing Theme Parks
and new accommodation offerings and transforming our Theme Parks into short break destinations,
which increases accommodation revenue and pre-bookings while also reducing attraction revenue
volatility. Our new business capital expenditure is principally in respect of the development of new sites
but can also be in respect of acquired sites. In addition, our strategy aims to provide each Attraction
with a dedicated investment cycle plan featuring varying capital expenditure levels over a multi-year
period.

Our capital expenditure was £39 million and £73 million for Q1 2022 and Q1 2023, respectively.
Existing Estate capital expenditure was £26 million and £56 million, capital expenditure for the
development of accommodation was £2 million and £3 million, capital expenditure for the roll-out of
Midway Attractions was £1 million and £5 million, capital expenditure for the development of new
LEGOLAND Parks was £8 million and £nil million and capital expenditure for additional projects was
£2 million and £9 million, for Q1 2022 and Q1 2023, respectively.

During the 2020, 2021 and 2022 financial years, we invested 12 per cent., 6 per cent. and 7 per cent.,
respectively, of our total revenue for each financial year in capital expenditure relating to the
development of our Existing Estate. Existing Estate capital expenditure typically includes (i) adding
new rides and Attractions, (ii) replacing old features with new, more up to date ones and (iii) general
maintenance and refurbishment of existing Attractions (including ensuring health and safety standards
are met or exceeded). Such investments are intended to maintain or improve product appeal and guest
experience, which is key to increasing visitor attendance levels and length of stay, and support increases
in admission fees (above inflation) and commercial spend. We typically benefit from increased visitor
numbers and revenue from an Attraction in the year of opening a new ride or other significant product
investment at the site. For further details regarding our planned approach with regard to upgrading and
refreshing our Existing Estate, see “—Factors Affecting our Results of Operations—Management of
_Capital Investments.”_

For details of the average investment costs in respect of Midway Attractions opened during the periods
under review, see “—Factors Affecting our Results of Operations—Roll out of Midway Attractions”
and “—Factors Affecting our Results of Operations—Development of LEGOLAND Parks.”

Our Existing Estate capital expenditure in Q1 2023 reflects our spend on projects that have opened or
are expected to open in 2023, including a “World of Jumanji” themed land at our Chessington World
of Adventures Resort and a “LEGO Mythica” themed world at LEGOLAND Deutschland. Our New
Business Development capital expenditure in Q1 2023 included investments on new accommodation
projects, on the LEGO Discovery Center expected to open in Springfield, Washington D.C. in 2023,
and on the second Peppa Pig theme park expected to open in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in 2024.

Our capital expenditure in the 2022 financial year of £195 million included significant investments in
new Attractions such as the LEGOLAND Korea park. We also made investments in new Midway
Attractions including a Peppa Pig World of Play Attraction in Leidschendam (the Netherlands) and a
LEGO Discovery Centre in Brussels (Belgium). Capital expenditure further included a 154 room hotel
at LEGOLAND Korea.

Our capital expenditure in the 2021 financial year of £291 million included significant investments in
new Attractions such as the LEGOLAND Korea and LEGOLAND New York parks. We also made
investments in new Midway Attractions including two SEA LIFE centres located in San Antonio and
New Jersey in the USA, one Madame Tussauds attraction in Dubai and one Peppa Pig World of Play
in Chicago. Capital expenditure further included new accommodation developments such as a 250 room
hotel at LEGOLAND New York.

Our capital expenditure in the 2020 financial year of £301 million included investments in new
Attractions such as the LEGOLAND Korea and LEGOLAND New York parks. We also made
investments in new Midway Attractions planned for opening in future years. Capital expenditure further
included new accommodation developments such as a 150 room Pirate Island Hotel in LEGOLAND
Florida.

**Contractual Commitments**

For a description of the material terms of our existing and anticipated material long term financing
arrangements, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.”

In addition, the LCA requires us to develop the LEGOLAND business and the extension of the term of
the LCA on an exclusive basis is subject to the development of a certain number of LEGOLAND Parks
or LEGO/LEGOLAND Discovery Centres. See “Business—Material Contracts—Intellectual


-----

_Property” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Market and Our Business—Our use of the_
_LEGOLAND and LEGO trademarks, content and other intellectual property rights are subject to the_
_terms and conditions of the LCA.”_

As of 31 December 2022, we have a number of outstanding capital commitments in respect of capital
expenditure at our Existing Estate (including accommodation), as well as for Midway Attractions that
are under construction. These commitments are expected to be settled within two financial years of the
reporting date and amounted to £62 million as of 31 December 2022 (compared to £70 million as of 25
December 2021) for which no provision has been made.

**Pensions**

We operate a number of defined contribution pension schemes as well as a closed defined benefit
scheme for certain former UK employees of The Tussauds Group, which was acquired in 2007, and a
closed defined benefit scheme for certain employees of Gardaland Resort in Italy. The Tussauds Group
scheme entitles retired employees to receive an annual payment based on a percentage of final salary
for each year of service that the employee provided. The entitlement of the retired employees under the
Gardaland scheme is dependent on the state laws in place at the date employment commenced and is
subject to a certain minimum period of service. The total expense relating to our defined contribution
pension schemes in the 2022 financial year was £13 million (compared to £11 million in the 2021
financial year). For further information with respect to the expenses relating to the defined contribution
schemes and the assets and liabilities in respect of the defined benefit schemes, see note 6.2 to the
audited consolidated financial statements for the 2022 financial year, included elsewhere in this
Offering Memorandum.

**Disclosure about Market and Credit Risks**

We are exposed to market risks, including interest rate, credit and liquidity risks, as well as adverse
changes in currency exchange rates. Our risk management policies are determined by our board of
directors and managed by our finance department in accordance with documented internal control
procedures. All significant transactions are authorised by either our executive committee or by the board
of directors according to the scale of commitment.

**_Currency Risk_**

As we operate internationally, the performance of our business is sensitive to movements in foreign
exchange rates. Our potential currency exposures comprise transaction and translation exposures.

We aim to ensure that net exposure to foreign currency balances is kept to a minimal level by using
foreign currency swaps to exchange balances back into sterling or by buying and selling foreign
currencies at spot rates when necessary. The fair value of foreign exchange contracts is the present value
of future cash flows and is determined by reference to market rates. At 31 December 2022 the fair value
of foreign currency swap assets was £5 million and the fair value of the foreign currency swap liabilities
was £7 million, none of which are hedge accounted.

_Transaction Exposures_

Our revenue and costs of operations are denominated primarily in the currencies of the relevant local
territories. Any significant cross border trading exposures are hedged by the use of forward foreign
exchange contracts.

_Translation Exposures_

Our results, as presented in sterling, are subject to fluctuations as a result of exchange rate movements.
We do not hedge this translation exposure to our earnings but, where material, may carry out net asset


-----

hedging by borrowing in the same currencies as the currencies of our operating units or by using forward
foreign exchange contracts.

Gains or losses arise on the retranslation of the net assets of foreign operations at different reporting
dates and are recognised within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. They will
predominantly relate to the retranslation of opening net assets at closing foreign exchange rates, together
with the retranslation of retained foreign profits for the year (that have been accounted for in the
consolidated income statement at average rates) at closing rates. Gains or losses also arise on the
retranslation of foreign currency denominated borrowings designated as effective net investment hedges
of overseas net assets. These are offset in equity by corresponding gains or losses arising on the
retranslation of the related hedged foreign currency net assets. We also treat specific intercompany loan
balances, which are not intended to be repaid in the foreseeable future, as part of our net investment. In
the event of a foreign entity being sold or a hedging item being extinguished, such exchange differences
would be recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.

_Sensitivity Analysis on Foreign Currency Risk_

Gains or losses in the income statement and equity are offset by the retranslation of the related foreign
currency net assets or specific intercompany loan balances. As of 31 December 2022, a 10 per cent.
strengthening of all currencies against sterling would increase net debt by £383 million (2021 financial
year: £359 million).

For the financial year ended 31 December 2022, a 10 per cent. strengthening of all currencies against
sterling would reduce the fair value of foreign exchange contracts and result in a charge to the income
statement of £5 million (2021 financial year: £13 million).

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

We are exposed to interest rate risk on both our interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities,
including in connection with our fixed and floating rate indebtedness. We have a policy of actively
managing our interest rate risk exposure using a combination of fixed rate debt, interest rate swaps, and
interest rate caps.

To achieve a balance of fixed and floating interest rates across currencies, we may also use floating to
fixed interest rate swaps and caps (which are part of cash flow hedging relationships) and fixed to
floating interest rate swaps and caps (which are part of fair value hedging relationships). In 2022, we
entered into hedging arrangements on $600 million of floating rate U.S. dollar-denominated
indebtedness to swap the floating interest rate to a fixed rate and on €700 million of floating rate €denominated indebtedness to cap the floating interest rate to a capped rate on our drawn floating rate
facilities. In aggregate, in the 2022 financial year, 67 per cent. (2021: 37 per cent.) of the our interestbearing loans and borrowings is at a fixed/capped rate for a weighted average period of 4 years (2021:
5 years). As of 31 December 2022, the fair value of interest rate derivative assets was £39 million (2021:
£nil). These interest rate derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.

**_Credit Risk_**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument
fails to meet its contractual obligations. Credit risk is limited to the carrying value of the Group’s
monetary assets. The Group has limited credit risk with its customers, the vast majority of whom pay
in advance or at the time of their visit. There are credit policies in place with regard to its trade
receivables with credit evaluations performed on customers requiring credit over a certain amount.

In addition, we manage credit exposures in connection with financing and treasury activities including
exposures arising from bank deposits, cash held at banks and derivative transactions, by appraisal,
formal approval and ongoing monitoring of the credit position of counterparties. Counterparty
exposures are measured against a formal transaction limit appropriate to that counterparty’s credit


-----

position. We also appraise investments before they are made to ensure the associated credit risk is
acceptable. Performance of investments are closely monitored, in some cases through Board
participation, to ensure returns are in line with expectations and credit risk remains acceptable. In the
2022 financial year, there were no overdue amounts in respect of investments and no impairments have
been recorded (2021: £nil).

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that we will not have sufficient funds to meet our financial obligations as they
fall due. We produce short term and long-term cash forecasts to identify our liquidity requirements.
Surplus cash is actively managed across our bank accounts to cover local shortfalls or invested in bank
deposits or other short term liquid investments such as money market funds. In some jurisdictions bank
cash pooling arrangements are in place to optimise the use of cash. As of 31 December 2022, we had
£266 million of cash and cash equivalents and, under our Senior Facilities, among other facilities, a
Revolving Facility in the amount of £400 million, of which £30 million is carved out as an ancillary
facility. Giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had cash and cash equivalents of £302 million
as of 1 April 2023.

**_Critical Accounting Policies_**

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. The preparation of
these financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying our accounting
policies. It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

We consider the following policies to be the most significant policies that require management to make
subjective and complex judgements or to consider matters that are inherently uncertain, which may
cause actual results to differ from the estimated and assumptions we use in applying the critical
accounting policies described below.

_Lease Liability_

IFRS 16 became effective for reporting periods in 2019 and introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease
accounting model for lessees. The discount rate used in the calculation of the lease liability involves
estimation. Discount rates are calculated on a lease by lease basis. For the property leases that make up
substantially all of our lease portfolio, this results in two approaches. For a small volume of leases, the
rate implicit in the lease can be calculated and is therefore adopted. Otherwise, for the majority of leases,
the rate used is based on estimates of incremental borrowing costs. These will depend on the territory
of the relevant lease and hence the currency used, the date of lease inception and the lease term. As a
result, reflecting the breadth of our lease portfolio, the transition approach adopted which has required
estimation of historic discount rates and estimations as to lease lives, there are a large number of
discount rates within a wide range.

IFRS 16 defines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease together with the options to
extend or terminate a lease, if the lessee were reasonably certain to exercise that option. Where a lease
includes the option for us to extend the lease term, we make a judgement as to whether it is reasonably
certain that the option will be taken. This will take into account the length of time remaining before the
option is exercisable, current trading, future trading forecasts as to the ongoing profitability of the
Attraction and the level and type of planned future capital investment. This judgement is reassessed at
each reporting period. A reassessment of the remaining life of the lease could result in a recalculation
of the lease liability and a material adjustment to the associated balances.

_Revenue Recognition_

IFRS 15 (Revenue from contracts with customers) establishes a comprehensive framework for
determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. IFRS 15 requires us to make an


-----

assessment, considering the control principles of IFRS 15, as to whether parties involved in providing
goods or services to a customer are acting as a principal (if they control delivery to the customer) or, if
they are arranging for those goods or services to be provided by the other party, as an agent.

Under IFRS 15, the following categories of revenue (all excluding VAT and similar taxes) have been
disaggregated:

- Visitor revenue, which represents admissions tickets, retail, food and beverage sales and other
commercial offerings such as photos and games experiences inside an Attraction. Ticket revenue is
recognised at point of entry. Revenue from annual passes and other tickets that entitle a customer
to continued visits over a period of time is deferred and then recognised evenly over the period that
the pass is valid. Retail and food and beverage revenue, along with other similar commercial
offerings, is recognised at point of sale.

- Accommodation revenue, which represents overnight stay and conference room revenue along with
food and beverage revenue earned within our hotels and other accommodation offerings.
Accommodation revenue is recognised at the time when a customer stays at our accommodations.

- Other revenue, which represents sponsorship, function, management and service contract revenue
along with other sundry items. Sponsorship revenue is recognised over the relevant contract term.
Function revenue is recognised at the time of the event. Management and service contract revenue
is recognised in line with the performance obligations in the specific contract.

_Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets_

Deferred tax is provided on certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and taxation purposes respectively. The following temporary
differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or
liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and
differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent that they will probably
not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected
manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period. After considering forecast future
profits, deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profits will be available
against which those assets can be utilised.

_Business Combinations_

When a business combination takes place, management consider the rights and intentions of the
management of both entities and the overall controlling parties before and after acquisition to determine
who the acquiring party is, and then account for business combinations by applying the purchase
method. Having determined the acquiring party, any individually identifiable assets and contingent
liabilities acquired are valued. These include the property, plant and equipment and any intangible assets
which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are
separable, with any remaining balance being assigned to goodwill.

Given the specialised nature of the property, plant and equipment acquired, fair values are calculated
on a depreciated replacement cost basis. The key estimates are the replacement cost, where industry
specific indices are used to restate original historic cost; and depreciation, where the total and remaining
economic useful lives are considered, together with the residual value of each asset. The total estimated
lives applied are consistent with those set out in note 3.1 to the audited consolidated financial statements
for each of the 2021 and 2022 financial years, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.
Residual values are based on industry specific indices.


-----

_Goodwill and Useful Life of Brands_

Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of an acquisition and the fair value of the net
identifiable assets acquired and any contingent liabilities assumed. Goodwill is stated at cost less any
accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-generating units and is not
amortised but is tested annually for impairment. In respect of joint ventures, the carrying amount of
goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the joint venture. Where they arise on
acquisition, brands have been valued based on discounted future cash flows using the relief from royalty
method, including amounts into perpetuity. Certain brands are regarded as having indefinite useful
economic lives. This is based upon the strong historical performance of the brands over a number of
economic cycles, the demonstrable “chaining” of brands, and managements’ intentions regarding the
future use of brands. We believe this is a suitable policy for a brands business which invests in and
maintains the brands, and foresee no technological developments or competitor actions which would
put a definite life on the brands.

_Impairment Testing_

The carrying amounts of our goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) are
reviewed annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication
exists, or in respect of indefinite lived assets, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.

The process of impairment testing is to estimate the recoverable amount of the assets concerned, and
recognise an impairment loss whenever the carrying amount of those assets exceeds the recoverable
amount.

The level at which the assets concerned are reviewed varies as follows: Goodwill is reviewed at an
operating group level, being the relevant grouping of cash generating units (“CGUs”) at which the
benefit of such goodwill arises. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates largely
independent cash inflows, which are our individual Attractions. Brands are reviewed individually. PPE
is reviewed at the Attraction level. For assets that do not generate largely independent cash inflows, the
recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which the assets belong.

Our management judges the recoverable amount of an asset as the greater of its value in use and its fair
value less costs to sell. To assess value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present
value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate. Our internally approved five year business plans or
more recent best estimates are used as the basis for these calculations, with cash flows beyond the five
year business plan horizon then extrapolated using a long-term growth rate.

Common assumptions have been adopted for the purpose of testing goodwill across the business and
for testing brand values as their risk profiles are similar. The key assumptions and estimates used when
calculating the net present value of future cash flows from our businesses include growth in EBITDA,
the timing and quantum of future capital expenditure and maintenance expenditure, long-term growth
rates and discount rates to reflect the risks involved. These assumptions and estimates are described
further in note 4.3 to the audited consolidated financial statements for the 2021 and 2022 financial years
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

_Recognition of Provisions_

Provisions are recognised when we have legal or constructive obligations as a result of past events and
it is probable that expenditure will be required to settle those obligations. They are measured at
management’s best estimates, after taking account of information available and different possible
outcomes.

If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate,
the risks specific to the liability.


-----

_Accounting for Interest-bearing Loans and Borrowings_

Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, being consideration received
less any directly attributable transaction costs. Thereafter, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are
stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the
income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis. To calculate this
effective interest rate, we estimate the date of repayment, expected future gearing during the life of the
facility based on our business plans and forecasts, and expected future interest rates. This includes the
amortisation of all transaction costs over the same period. We assess whether the terms of the
borrowings provide a clear commercial incentive or a contractual commitment to repay them over a
specific period that is shorter than the contractual life of the facility. If this is the case, we adopt the
short period as the period used for the purposes of the effective interest rate calculations. If neither of
these conditions exist, we calculate our effective interest rate and hence amortises transaction costs
based on the contractual term of the facility. If we determine that a different date should be adopted for
the purposes of the effective interest rate calculations, the resulting adjustment is recognised as a gain
or loss on re-measurement and presented separately in the income statement.

If we modify our debt arrangements, we consider how substantive the change is in determining the
appropriate accounting. This includes both qualitative analysis, and quantitative analysis of the level of
change in the cash flows of the new and old arrangements.

_Fair Value of Derivative Financial Instruments_

We hold derivative financial instruments primarily to hedge our foreign currency and interest rate
exposures.

Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value and attributable transaction costs are recognised in
profit or loss as incurred. Thereafter changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income
statement, except in specific circumstances where we adopt hedge accounting, as described below.

The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by reference to market rates at the end of the
accounting period. It is the estimated amount that we would receive or pay to exit the swap at the end
of the reporting period, taking into account current interest rates, credit risks and bid/ask spreads.

The fair value of foreign exchange contracts is the present value of future cash flows and is determined
by reference to market rates at the end of the accounting period.

The fair value of derivative provisions for committed share issues is determined by reference to
contractually agreed amounts and the value of the shares to be issued, which management assesses
based on the value attributed in recent transactions of our shares.

We have designated certain derivatives as hedges against variable cash flows resulting from fluctuations
in interest rates. On initial designation of the hedge, we formally document the relationship between the
hedging instruments and hedged items, including the risk management objectives and strategy in
undertaking the hedge transaction, and the methods that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the
hedging relationship. We make an assessment, both at the inception of the hedge relationship as well as
on an ongoing basis, as to whether the hedging instruments are expected to be ‘highly effective’ in
offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the respective hedged items during the life of
the hedge. Effectiveness testing is performed using regression analysis at inception and on a regular
basis thereafter. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Hedging Agreements.”

The effective portion of changes in fair value of the derivative is recognised in other comprehensive
income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair
value of the derivative is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The amount recognised in other
comprehensive income is removed and included in profit or loss in the same period as the hedged cash


-----

flows affect profit or loss, and under the same line item in the statement of comprehensive income as
the hedged item.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the fair value adjustment
to the carrying value of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised to profit and loss
from that date.

**_Overview of the Attractions Industry_**

We are a global leader in branded, location based, family entertainment with a portfolio of Attractions
serving the global leisure market, of which the attractions industry forms a part. According to the
WTTC, travel and tourism’s contribution to the global economy is forecast to increase by a CAGR of
5.1 per cent. per annum between 2023 and 2033, from approximately $7.7 trillion in 2022, to an
expected $9.5 trillion throughout 2023 and $15.5 trillion in 2033, which reflects faster growth than that
of the global economy. Long-term growth of the attractions industry may be driven by a number of
factors including: (i) increasing trend in developed markets toward multiple short breaks at home or
abroad; (ii) consumers prioritising experiences over goods; (iii) growing international tourism driven
by more affordable air fares and desire to seek new experiences; (iv) increased leisure time to enjoy
entertainment; (v) rising income and more affluent populations in developing countries, notably China;
(vi) demand for higher quality out-of-home entertainment; (vii) improving transport infrastructure,
including ease of access from long-distance travel infrastructure and (viii) a greater number of highquality, branded entertainment options.

We segment the attractions industry into a commercial sector, including paid-for attractions, and a
public sector, including state-owned, primarily free-entry attractions such as museums and parks.
Within the commercial attractions sector, we have identified four key categories: (i) theme parks,
including both international destinations and national/regional destinations; (ii) regional amusement
parks; (iii) smaller visitor attractions; and (iv) larger zoos and wildlife attractions.

Our focus is mainly on the national/regional destination theme parks and smaller visitor attractions
sectors.

**_Theme Parks_**

We define theme parks as outdoor sites with rides and shows as the main attractions, which can be
seasonally operated or open all year round, depending on the location. They often focus on a central
theme or themes and are aimed at appealing to families and/or young adults. Revenue is driven by
visitor volumes, upfront admission fees, commercial revenue, including the sale of retail merchandise
(for example, LEGO bricks and related toys in the case of the LEGOLAND Parks), food and beverages
and ancillary products such as souvenir photography. On-site accommodation has also become an
increasingly important part of the revenue mix, with a greater number of national, regional and
international visitors staying for short breaks or longer.

Theme parks can be sub-categorised between international and national/regional destination theme
parks.

_International Destination Theme Parks_

International destination theme parks typically target visitors from a wide catchment area, including
international “fly-in” tourists, and attract families as their prime demographic. The majority of such
sites are located in the United States (for example, Disney, Universal Studios and SeaWorld), in Asia
(Disney and Universal Studios) and only one in Europe (Disneyland Paris). Global recognisable brands
have become increasingly important in attracting visitors to destination parks. We categorise


-----

international destination theme parks as theme parks which typically attract more than five million
visitors annually and cost approximately £2,000 per visit (with accommodation) for a family of four.
Attractions tend to be themed experiences, with a focus on storytelling, and are based on owned or
licensed intellectual property. Lengths of visitor stays are generally longer than for national/regional
destination theme parks and can reach up to two weeks as part of a resort package. Commercial spend
is a significant source of revenue with on-site accommodation comprising an important part of the
international destination theme park.

_National/Regional Destination Theme Parks_

National/regional destination theme parks target visitors from the surrounding area (up to a five hour
drive), in some cases complemented by a limited number of international visitors from neighbouring
countries. We categorise national/regional destination theme parks as theme parks which typically
attract between one and four million visitors annually. Attractions tend to be themed experiences,
typically attracting families and teens for one to three day visits. Retail merchandise, food and beverages
and ancillary products are key commercial sources of revenue. Accommodation including on-site hotels
are becoming increasingly important to national/regional destination theme parks as the shift towards
shorter, more frequent breaks continues. In the UK, there has been significant growth in breaks lasting
two to four nights as the traditional two week family holiday has declined. In Europe, most theme parks
can be categorised as national/regional destination theme parks. PortAventura in Spain, Efteling in the
Netherlands and Europa-Park in Germany are examples of European national/regional destination
theme parks. Our European Theme Parks (including the LEGOLAND Parks) are examples of European
national destination theme parks, although some also receive a significant proportion of visitors from
neighbouring regions. The Busch Gardens theme parks, in Florida and Virginia, are examples of
national/regional destination theme parks in the United States.

**_Regional Amusement Parks_**

Regional amusement parks have historically developed from travelling shows and are now characterised
by having thrill rides with limited theming as their main attractions. Regional amusement parks
generally attract older children and young adults with an average stay of half a day and a typical journey
time of up to two hours.

We categorise regional amusement parks as amusement parks which typically attract up to one million
visitors annually. Rather than charge admission fees up front, some amusement parks offer a “pay-as_you-go” format where commercial spend is typically limited. We consider Blackpool Pleasure Beach_
in the UK and the various Six Flags parks in the United States to be examples of regional amusement
parks.

**_Smaller Visitor Attractions_**

We define smaller visitor attractions as broadly indoor, commercial venues aimed at appealing to either
a broad range of visitors or a specific target group and offering various forms of entertainment
(excluding cinemas, theatres and sporting venues), which are typically located in city centre or coastal
environments or close to other significant population centres. They can be standalone buildings or part
of shopping malls or other entertainment centres.

Guests of smaller visitor attractions include tourists (both domestic and international) and local
residents and the length of stay is generally up to two hours. As the length of stay is shorter than that of
a theme park or amusement park, a higher proportion of revenue is generated through admission fees
than through commercial spend. Ongoing capital expenditure requirements for smaller visitor
attractions are generally less than for theme parks and amusement parks as smaller visitor attractions
have a high level of “first time” visitors and are less reliant on repeat visitors (requiring new products
each year) and thrill rides (requiring higher capital expenditure). Examples of smaller visitor attractions
include Ripley’s Believe It or Not, Go Ape and Kidzania. Our Midway Attractions predominantly fall
into this category.


-----

**_Zoos and Wildlife Attractions_**

Zoos and other wildlife attractions can generally be categorised as targeting a family audience,
travelling for a half day visit from the surrounding area (up to a three hour drive). Locations vary
between city centre attractions, targeting tourists and local residents, and standalone wildlife centres,
often geared towards families or groups on a day trip. Given the relatively short length of stay, typically
up to five hours, revenues are more geared to admission fees, with a limited amount of commercial
spend. There is often an emphasis on education, conservation and understanding wildlife and animal
habitats.

**Industry Overview by Demographic Market**

We also classify the attractions industry by demographic appeal. While most visitor attractions target
multiple visitor segments, there are three main demographic categories that the commercial attractions
industry seeks to target:

- **_Families with young children: Attractions and parks that target families with young children_**
generally have the backing of a strong family brand (for example, the LEGOLAND brand or
Disney) or appeal to both children and adults who are seeking an enjoyable experience
alongside an element of education (for example, SEA LIFE Centres, Kidzania and zoos/wildlife
attractions);

- **_Families and adults: Most visitor attractions and a number of theme parks target the broader_**
segment of families (including grandparents with their grandchildren) and young adults,
including Madame Tussauds, the London Eye, Gardaland Resort, Alton Towers Resort and
Ripley’s Believe It or Not; and

- **_Teenagers and young adults: Parks that target teenagers, young adults and families with older_**
children tend to be positioned as regional theme and amusement parks with a focus on thrill
rides, as visitors typically spend no more than a day at the park given the intense nature of the
entertainment. State-of-the-art rides and the introduction of new rides are key drivers of visitor
volume. Parks of this type include THORPE PARK in the UK, and Six Flags and Cedar Point
in the United States. Certain visitor attractions, such as our “Dungeons” brand, are also targeted
at this visitor segment.

**Key Industry Drivers**

Over the long-term, the main drivers affecting the attractions industry are as follows:

- **_Visitor supply: Visitor supply for the majority of attractions is made up of existing residents_**
and tourists and is therefore influenced by the scale and growth of both groups as well as the
propensity of all individuals to visit attractions;

- **_Economic conditions: Economic cycles are a key driver of disposable income, which_**
influences spend on leisure activities. During downturns, though the number of international
visitors tends to decrease, regional/national theme parks, amusement parks and visitor
attractions can benefit from a “staycation” effect as individuals opt to forego destination
holidays in favour of entertainment closer to home. Foreign exchange rates can also impact
international visitor trends in the short-term as the cost of travel becomes relatively more or
less expensive. Over the longer term, growth in disposable income is an important driver for
overall demand for leisure activities but in the short-term, fluctuations in income can be
tempered by the “staycation” effect or foreign exchange fluctuations;

- **_Transportation infrastructure and accommodation: Improvements in transport services and_**
accommodation may positively affect customer satisfaction and visitor numbers at leisure


-----

attractions. Improvements in accommodation offerings at leisure attractions encourage multiday visits as well as higher levels of commercial spending;

- **_External events: Extraordinary or one-off events can have a significant impact on travel_**
patterns and consequently visitor numbers at leisure attractions. International destination theme
parks and some smaller visitor attractions derive revenues from international tourists, a group
that is susceptible to extraordinary events, such as contagious disease outbreaks, and influenced
by one-off global events, including sporting events such as the Olympics. Conversely,
national/regional destination theme parks that are located in areas that are unaffected by any
such extraordinary or one-off event tend to benefit from the decline in international travel as
holiday makers shift international trips to visits to attractions in their local market. However,
there are certain external events, such as terrorism, that can affect both international and
domestic visitors alike. There are other extraordinary events such as accidents in attractions at
theme parks that may not affect travel or tourism, but may impact visitor numbers at leisure
attractions; and

- **_Capital expenditure: Most theme and amusement parks introduce a new significant attraction_**
every few years to support the growth of visitor supply. In addition to driving visitor growth,
investment in new rides or features can also enable operators to increase admission prices. This
is particularly relevant with respect to small visitor attractions where less capital expenditure is
required to maintain visitor volumes, however capital expenditure can drive revenue by
providing a justification for higher admission prices.

**Market Trends**

**_Global Trends_**

We believe that trends in tourism activity are an important component of attendance and overall spend
at our portfolio of Attractions. Increasing globalisation, urbanisation and rising disposable income have
been major factors for growth in international tourism.

A key indicator measuring the size of the tourism industry is the number of international tourist arrivals.
According to the UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), in 2019, tourism growth continued to
outpace the global economy, with approximately 1.5 billion international tourist arrivals, indicating an
increase of approximately 4 per cent. over the previous year.

The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant adverse impact on the travel and tourism industry. Travel
restrictions were imposed in numerous markets across the globe; aircrafts were grounded, and hotels
closed. However, in 2022, international tourist arrivals totalled 917 million and grew by 102 per cent.,
compared to 2021, according to the UNWTO, representing strong recovery. On a regional basis, the
Asia and the Pacific was the fastest growing region, increasing by 240 per cent., followed by the Middle
East increasing by 144 per cent., followed by Africa and then Europe increasing by 132 per cent. and
92 per cent. respectively. The Americas recorded combined growth of 75 per cent., with growth rates
mixed across North America, South America, Central America and the Caribbean.

We have Attractions in eight of the top ten cities ranked as top city destinations for 2022.

The UK continues to be a popular holiday destination. According to data reported by ONS, in 2022,
30.5 million inbound tourists came to the UK and spent approximately £25.7 billion during their visit.
Inbound tourism numbers grew by 414 per cent. compared to 2021 figures, demonstrating a strong
recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic and related closures. Tourist spend recovered faster than
tourist arrivals, with tourist arrivals in 2021 at 75 per cent. of 2019 levels compared to tourist spend at
90 per cent. of 2019 levels. According to VisitBritain, average spend per visit in 2022 was significantly
higher than pre-COVID, mainly due to an increase in spend per night broadly in line with inflation.
Direct travel and tourism gross domestic product (“GDP”) growth is expected to continue in 2023, with
VisitBritain forecasting 35.1 million visitors coming to the UK in 2023 and visitor spend to be £29.5


-----

billion in 2023. These figures represent a 14.9 per cent. increase in each metric compared to the
equivalent 2022 figures. If the latter figure is achieved, it would be a record for the value of inbound
spend in the UK in nominal terms.

Travel and tourism play a crucial role in the global economy, accounting for 7.6 per cent. of GDP in
2022, according to WTTC. Travel and tourism accounted for 8.1 per cent. of GDP in North America,
8.3 per cent. in Europe and 4.6 per cent. in Asia. According to the WTTC, between 2023 and 2033,
travel & tourism’s contribution to the global economy is expected to grow a CAGR of 5.1 per cent.,
which is almost double the 2.6 per cent. CAGR estimated for the global economy.

Global travel & tourism’s recovery post-COVID was supported more by the rise in the spending by
domestic visitors than revenues from international visitors. In 2021, travel & tourism domestic spending
recovered strongly – by 31.4 per cent. Y.o.Y globally – whereas spending by international visitors
recovered by only 3.8 per cent. Y.o.Y. as travel restrictions for foreign visitors remained in place across
many countries. As a result, the share of domestic spending within total travel & tourism spending
increased from 72 per cent. in 2019 to 85 per cent. in 2021, while the share of international spending
decreased from 28% to 15% during the same period.

Theme Park attendance continues to grow globally. According to the TEA/AECOM Theme Index and
Museum Index: The Global Attractions Attendance Report (2021), attendance at the top 25 global theme
parks has grown by 70 per cent., from approximately 83 million visitors in 2020 to approximately 141
million visitors in 2021. The strong recovery in 2021 was largely influenced by the easing up of
COVID-related travel restrictions, successful administration of vaccine roll-out, and an improvement
in the general consumer confidence levels. According to the 2012-2019 TEA/AECOM Reports, Theme
Park attendance on average grew by 3 per cent. per annum from 2012 to 2019 across all major markets.

open. International tourism in some locations also continued to recover; there were variations by
geography, most notably in China, where restrictions caused significant disruption, and lower levels of
outbound Chinese tourism continued to have a wider impact on the rest of the Asia Pacific estate.

Our latest major investment, LEGOLAND Korea, opened in May 2022 as the country was exiting from
its most severe COVID-19 wave. The LEGOLAND Korea hotel opened as planned in July. Our strategy
remains to offer amazing experiences across a range of exciting brands, diversified by target audience,
dwell time and geography, and by partnering with global brands such as Peppa Pig, Jumanji, and LEGO.
We are also working with partners to develop three LEGOLAND resorts in China over the next five
years in Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Sichuan province.


Our portfolio of assets and brands is highly diversified across geography, attraction type, brand and
customer demographic and well-balanced between indoor and outdoor attractions and international and
domestic visitation. We believe diversification strategy helps reduce our reliance on individual
attractions or locations.

**_Short Break Trends_**


We believe that the short break market, typically composed of one-to-three-day stays, is growing in
many of the countries and regions in which we operate and, in particular, in key destination cities, such
as London, Berlin, Sydney and Shanghai. According to the ONS, short breaks taken abroad by UK
residents have grown at a CAGR of 5.5 per cent. per annum from the 2009-2019 period, increasing
from 6 million short break holidays taken in 2009 to 10.3 million in 2019, while the growth rate of
longer holidays (14-27 nights) over the same period was -0.1 per cent. per annum. Recovery shown by
the short breaks market was also stronger with approximately 325 per cent growth in the 9 months of
2022 as compared to the full year 2021 figures. We believe we are increasingly well positioned to meet
this demand by transforming our theme parks into destination resorts, extending visitor market reach
and enhancing revenues from a number of sales channels. These include primary admissions (including
multi-day tickets and second gate admission fees), and commercial spend such as the sale of food and
beverages, retail merchandise, and souvenirs such as photos.

There are also ongoing opportunities to add new visitor attractions at our theme parks, for which
additional admission fees are charged. These attractions, such as waterparks, are referred to as Second
Gate attractions. In 2021 we opened the LEGOLAND Water Park at the Gardaland Resort (the first
LEGO themed water park in Europe), and in early 2022 we launched our first standalone Peppa Pig
theme park, adjacent to LEGOLAND Florida Resort.


-----

By creating attractive and highly successful theme accommodation formats on-site and working with
hotel partners, as well as continuing to develop Second Gate attractions, we aim to capitalise on the
growing short break market and encourage customers to increase both the duration of their stay at our
Attractions and also their overall spend.

**Competitive Landscape**

We have a broad set of competitors within the attractions leisure industry, although we believe there
are relatively few international operators with the same scale and core focus on family entertainment as
Merlin. In addition, we also compete with more traditional entertainment offerings such as cinemas,
museums (many of which are free or government-subsidised), sporting and gaming events and large
shopping malls.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are a global leader in branded, location-based family entertainment. As of 1 April 2023, we operated
141 Attractions, 24 hotels and 6 holiday villages in 24 countries across four continents, and in the 53
weeks ended 31 December 2022, we welcomed approximately 56 million visitors to our Attractions.
We were the second largest theme park operator globally by number of visitors in 2019, according to
TEA/AECOM. We also own eight of Europe’s largest 20 theme parks by number of visitors as of 2021.
We believe we are a market leader in the United Kingdom, Northern Germany and Italy, based on total
visitor numbers in 2021 to Europe’s top 20 theme parks, with an already significant and growing
presence in the United States and the Asia Pacific region. We believe we own and/or operate a unique
portfolio of chainable iconic assets and brands, possessing strong heritage within their original markets,
as well as being globally scalable and supported by our extensive technical and creative expertise.

Our vision is to establish ourselves as the global leader in location-based entertainment. To this end, we
consider our main purpose to deliver memorable experiences to all our visitors, while maintaining a
strategy aimed at creating a high growth, high return, family entertainment business, naturally balanced
against the pressures of the macroeconomic environment in which we operate. We possess a unique
portfolio of family entertainment brands and iconic assets, which are highly diversified across
geography, attraction type, brand and customer demographic and well balanced between indoor and
outdoor Attractions and international and domestic visitation (with international and domestic visitation
measured relative to the relevant Attraction). We believe our footprint across 24 countries provides us
with a favourable platform to benefit from global growth in spending on travel and tourism, which
according to the WTTC, is forecast to increase by a CAGR of 5.1 per cent. per annum between 2023
and 2033 (from $9.5 trillion to $15.5 trillion), by allowing us to attract both international tourists and
domestic visitors, and providing us with a buffer in the event of macroeconomic and currency risks.
Our operating groups offer our visitors diverse entertainment options, including both indoor Attractions
within city centres as well as outdoor theme parks offering multi day visits. In the 53 weeks ended 1
April 2023, 45 per cent. of our revenue was derived from our LEGOLAND Parks and 22 per cent. of
our revenue was derived from our Resort Theme Parks operations, which are primarily organised around
outdoor activities, and 33 per cent. of our revenue was derived from our Midway Attractions operating
group, which is primarily organised around indoor activities, providing a natural hedge against weather
disruptions.

We have established a diverse portfolio of nationally and internationally recognised premium brands
focused on delivering memorable experiences to millions of visitors around the world. We generated
revenue of £2,084 million, Adjusted EBITDA of £717 million, Adjusted EBITDA (pre-IFRS 16) of
£601 million and profit before tax of £126 million in the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2023.

America and the Asia Pacific region. MMM is responsible for driving innovation across our group.
These teams capture a combination of skills, including research, creative, production and project
management. We also maintain specific resources within our Operating Groups which are dedicated to
researching future opportunities, searching out locations for potential new attractions and negotiating
with local landlords, developers and civic bodies, while also managing a wide range of construction
projects including individual rides and attractions to improve our Existing Estate and leverage organic
growth opportunities.

Moreover, MMM creates compelling propositions and develops new concepts into commercially viable
attractions. Our in-house production capabilities include bespoke content such as wax figures, attraction
theming and LEGO model production, thereby creating efficiencies and reducing costs. MMM is central
to our major projects. In 2022, these projects included MMM’s work to develop LEGOLAND Korea
and the LEGOLAND Korea hotel, the Peppa Pig Theme Park Florida, a Second Gate attraction (which
are visitor attractions at an existing resort with a separate entrance and for which additional admission
fees are charged), adjacent to LEGOLAND Florida Resort, LEGO Discovery Center, Brussels and
Peppa Pig World of Play in Leideschendam, Netherlands, all of which opened in 2022.

As part of the ongoing development of our footprint, we also manage construction projects including
for individual rides and attractions in our Existing Estate, new Midway attractions across the globe and
also engage in the development of full-scale LEGOLAND resorts, the latter through a range of
ownership models which we deploy when pursuing new locations. Capital expenditure for our
LEGOLAND projects which are under a management contract model, are generally not incurred by us
directly, but rather by our local partners. For example, the capital expenditure related to our
LEGOLAND Shenzhen and LEGOLAND Sichuan resorts are incurred by our local partners, while the
capital expenditure related to the LEGOLAND Shanghai resort is incurred by a joint venture in which
we are a minority investor. We also leverage our extensive experience to provide an opportunity for
investors to develop location-based entertainment offerings, and to take on the operation of other
parties’ attractions under management contracts.

We believe that our Attractions continue to broaden our appeal in different markets and geographies,
and reflect the increasing volume and strength of our relationships with third-party intellectual property
holders who seek to leverage their content through location-based entertainment. In 2021, we opened
four LEGOLAND Discovery Centres, which comprised two locations in the USA (San Francisco Bay
Area, and New Jersey), one location in the Netherlands and one in Hong Kong. Moreover, we further
strengthened our USA footprint by opening two SEA LIFE Centres in San Antonio and New Jersey,
along with a Peppa Pig World of Play attraction in Chicago. Over the same period, we also opened a
Madame Tussauds attraction in Dubai (UAE). In 2022, we completed the acquisition of the COEX
Aquarium in Seoul, South Korea, and have taken over the operations of the Cadbury World Attraction
in the UK. Over the same period, we also opened one additional indoor Peppa Pig World of Play
attraction in Leidschendam, one standalone Peppa Pig theme park close to LEGOLAND Florida Resort,
a LEGO Discovery Centre in Brussels (Belgium) and have taken over the management contract of
Amsterdam’s THIS IS HOLLAND flying theatre experience.

Our strategy and performance is underpinned by our commitment to operational excellence and is
driven by an integrated approach to quality management, capital investment, marketing and pricing,
together with a focus on health and safety. We believe that our rebound from COVID-19, highlighted
by strong financial returns in 2022, is also the result of our efficient and strategic deployment of capital
expenditure across the Existing Estate and new Attractions.

We have demonstrated the strength of our diversified business model through our historical financial
track record. The drivers of this performance are:

- investment in our Existing Estate to grow demand, improve customer satisfaction, and where
applicable, to increase capacity. Increasingly, these investments are made in partnership with
leading intellectual property owners to provide immersive, themed experiences for our visitors


-----

(such as “Jumanji — The Adventure” which opened at Gardaland in 2022 and “World of
_Jumanji” which recently opened at Chessington World of Adventures, both part of our multi-_
territory exclusivity agreement with Sony Pictures Entertainment);

- developing new LEGOLAND Parks, including the opening of LEGOLAND New York in 2021
(which included a 250-room hotel), LEGOLAND Korea in 2022 (which included a 154-room
hotel), the targeted opening of LEGOLAND Sichuan resort, LEGOLAND Shanghai resort and
LEGOLAND Shenzhen resort in China, each of which are expected to be during or after 2025,
and potentially other new LEGOLAND Parks in the rest of the world, subject to targeted return
on investment criteria;

- open new Midway Attractions as part of our chainable global brands to drive our organic
revenue growth, with a focus on developing “cluster” locations (where multiple Attractions are
situated in one city or region to capitalise on cross-selling, including through our multi
attraction pass opportunities) and new sites outside of Europe, including in emerging markets.
For example, in 2022, we opened a Peppa Pig World of Play Attraction in Leidschendam (the
Netherlands), a LEGO Discovery Centre in Brussels (Belgium) and have taken over the
management contract for Amsterdam’s THIS IS HOLLAND flying theatre experience, thereby
expanding our local clusters of attractions. We are also expecting to open a LEGO Discovery
Center in Springfield, Washington D.C. in 2023;

- transforming our Theme Parks into destination resorts by deploying a broad range of themed
accommodation and new Attractions, with the aim to improve our customer satisfaction and
drive multi day visitation. For example, in 2021 we opened a LEGOLAND Water Park at our
Gardaland Resort and in 2022 we launched our first standalone Peppa Pig theme park, close to
our LEGOLAND Florida premises. In addition, we are expecting to open the UK’s first LEGO
themed holiday village at LEGOLAND Windsor Resort in 2024, featuring 150 lodges and one
on-site restaurant, complemented by a family entertainment hub;

- acquisitions and new-format opportunities to enhance our portfolio and enable us to grow into
new geographies. For example, in 2022 we completed the acquisition of the COEX Aquarium
in Seoul, South Korea, and have taken over the operations of the Cadbury World Attraction in
the UK. In addition, we also routinely develop new formats of attractions. Currently, our focus
is on Peppa Pig branded attractions aimed at pre-school children. To date, we have opened five
pilot indoor Peppa Pig World of Play attractions (including the one in Leidschendam in 2022),
and one standalone Peppa Pig theme park close to LEGOLAND Florida Resort. We are
planning to open a second Peppa Pig theme park in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in 2024.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

**_Unique Portfolio of Strong Brands and Iconic Assets_**

We own and/or operate a unique global portfolio of brands and iconic assets which we believe are
widely recognised by consumers from a wide range of demographic groups, enabling us to differentiate
our attractions from unbranded operators. Our portfolio of assets and brands is highly diversified across
geography, attraction type, brand and customer demographic and well balanced between indoor and
outdoor attractions and international and domestic visitation. Our well diversified portfolio makes us
well-positioned to meet both short-break and intra-day customer demands. We also partner with thirdparty intellectual property owners to create new brands which complement the portfolio and broaden
our appeal across all key target demographics.

Our Midway Attractions portfolio includes chainable brands such as SEA LIFE, Madame Tussauds and
lastminute.com London Eye, while our Resort Theme Parks attractions such as Gardaland Resort and
Alton Towers Resort, are standalone national brands in their respective markets. In addition, our
LEGOLAND Parks benefit from a mutually synergistic relationship with the LEGO Group, one of the
world’s leading toys’ brands associated with fun and learning through play, that recently celebrated its


-----

90[th] anniversary. The LEGO Group operates in over 100 countries with a global footprint of over 900
stores, based on publicly available information. Our portfolio is focused on delivering high quality
family entertainment, with the LEGOLAND Parks and LEGO/LEGOLAND Discovery Centres in
particular placing an emphasis on “playful learning.” We believe the strength and breadth of our iconic
brand portfolio enable us to offer compelling entertainment propositions through a wide variety of
activities and visitor experiences across a broad range of geographies. This allows us to attract a wide
range of target demographic groups, ranging from families with young children, teenagers, young adults
to older adults. We also believe that the size and diversity of our portfolio provides us with a degree of
resilience against short-term trading shocks which may impact a particular geography, brand or
demographic.

_Midway Attractions_

Our Midway Attractions benefit from high quality, chainable brands with broad international appeal
and recognition, which are distributed across geographies, markets and target demographics, creating a
diversified portfolio. As of 1 April 2023, we operate 25 Midway Attractions in the United Kingdom, 31
Midway Attractions in Continental Europe, 34 Midway Attractions in the Americas and 35 Midway
Attractions in the Asia Pacific region. Our 125 Midway Attractions (including Second Gate Attractions)
were distributed across four continents and included:

- Madame Tussauds, the world’s premier wax figures exhibition for over 200 years, where
visitors are encouraged to interact with historical and celebrity figures in both more mature and
emerging markets, comprising 22 Attractions in 12 countries;

- The Eye brand and observation Attractions with iconic, and internationally recognised
landmarks such as the lastminute.com London Eye and the Sydney Tower Eye;

- SEA LIFE, the world’s largest aquarium brand, comprising 47 Attractions in 19 countries, with
a strong name recognition and a track record of providing high quality and informative family
entertainment for over 40 years and campaigning actively on a variety of conservation issues
prioritised around breeding, rescue and protection of the marine environment;

- The Dungeons, comprising ten attractions in four countries with a strong reputation amongst
the teen and young adult market for a unique mix of dark, historical horror and irreverent
humour, delivered through set piece shows performed by live actors, rides and themed sets;

- LEGO/LEGOLAND Discovery Centres, an extension of the LEGOLAND brand to the Midway
Attractions format, offering the same values of interactivity and family fun in a smaller, more
accessible format, comprising 28 Attractions in ten countries, including the LEGO Discovery
Centre opened in Brussels in 2022; and

- Five Peppa Pig World of Play Attractions, comprising a range of attractions aimed at pre-school
children and based on the Peppa Pig brand, featuring family inclusive activities in an immersive
play environment and one Peppa Pig theme park, which features multiple rides, interactive
attractions, themes play-scapes and shows, all based on the Peppa Pig brand.

In addition, we routinely enhance our Midway Attractions portfolio by adding new Attractions. For
example, in 2022, we opened a Peppa Pig World of Play Attraction in Leidschendam (the Netherlands),
a LEGO Discovery Centre in Brussels (Belgium) and have taken over the management contract of
Amsterdam’s THIS IS HOLLAND flying theatre experience, thereby expanding our local clusters of
attractions. Lastly, we are expecting to open a LEGO Discovery Center in Springfield, Washington DC
in 2023. In 2022 we also completed the acquisition of the COEX Aquarium in Seoul, South Korea,
thereby adding a further significant attraction to the SEA LIFE portfolio, and have taken over the
operations of Cadbury World in the UK, which allowed us to strengthen our relationship with the UK’s
largest chocolate brand.


-----

Other Midway Attractions include two Treetop Walk experiences in Victoria and New South Wales,
Australia, one WILD LIFE Australian animal adventure Attractions in Sydney, “DreamWorks Tours’
_Shrek’s Adventure!”_ Midway Attraction in London, “Bear Grylls Adventure” Midway Attraction in
Birmingham and two “Little BIG City” Midway Attractions in Berlin and Beijing.

Our scale and portfolio of strong brands has allowed us to leverage a number of strategic synergies. We
have developed “clusters” of Midway Attractions in Amsterdam, Arizona, Bangkok, Beijing, Berlin,
Birmingham, Blackpool, Chicago, Dallas, Hong Kong Istanbul, Kansas City, London, Manchester,
Melbourne, Michigan, New Jersey, Oberhausen, Orlando, San Antonio, Scheveningen, Shanghai,
Shenyang, Sydney and Tokyo, where multiple Attractions are situated in one city or region to capitalise
on strong cross promotional and operational synergies, including multi attraction tickets to drive crossselling.

_LEGOLAND Resorts and Parks_

The LEGO brand is globally recognised and is associated with fun and learning through play. We hold
the global, exclusive license to own and operate LEGOLAND Parks until at least 2075. We own and/or
operate ten LEGOLAND Parks in eight countries. The parks are located in Denmark, Germany,
Malaysia, the United Kingdom, Dubai, California, Florida, New York, South Korea and Japan, all of
which build on the strength of the LEGO brand and are themed and interactive parks, which are
designed to appeal to families (particularly with children aged two to twelve years) looking for a fun
and engaging day out.

We have significantly expanded our LEGOLAND offering in recent years with the opening of
LEGOLAND New York in 2021 and LEGOLAND Korea in 2022. We operate the parks in Malaysia
and Dubai under management contracts. LEGOLAND Japan is “leased and operated,” meaning a thirdparty partner (a subsidiary of KIRKBI) funded the acquisition of the park site, the development of the
infrastructure and the basic construction while we funded and built the rides, provided the necessary
theming and built the on-site SEA LIFE Centre second gate and the on-site accommodation. We lease
the site on a long-term basis and operate the park.

In addition, we are also developing three LEGOLAND Parks in China in cooperation with local
partners. Each of LEGOLAND Sichuan resort, LEGOLAND Shanghai resort and LEGOLAND
Shenzhen resort is expected to open during or after 2025. All three will be operated under a management
contract model.

All of our open LEGOLAND Parks have themed on site hotels ranging from 61 to 263 rooms. During
the 2022 financial year, we opened a 250-room hotel at LEGOLAND Dubai, in partnership with the
park’s owners, and a 154-room hotel at LEGOLAND Korea. In addition, during the 2021 financial year
we opened a 250-room hotel at LEGOLAND New York and in the 2020 financial year we opened a
150 room LEGOLAND Florida Pirate Island hotel. Adding on site, themed accommodation has
historically improved guest satisfaction, increased the catchment area for our parks, increased the level
of pre booked revenue and improved cross-selling opportunities. We routinely consider potential plans
for adding additional accommodation at our LEGOLAND parks in future years. For example, we are
developing and plan to open in May 2024 a LEGOLAND Woodland Village, the UK’s first LEGO
themed holiday village, at LEGOLAND Windsor Resort. LEGOLAND Woodland Village will feature
150 lodges, an on-site restaurant, and a family entertainment hub. We believe these hotels and villages
provide an integral contribution to the overall customer experience and help drive increases in multi
day ticket sales.

We also have four Second Gate attractions close to our LEGOLAND Parks, including SEA Life
attractions alongside each of LEGOLAND California, Japan and Malaysia and a Peppa Pig Theme Park
close to LEGOLAND Florida.


-----

_Resort Theme Parks_

Each of our six Resort Theme Parks is a standalone national brand in their respective markets, aimed at
families, teenagers and young adults, with themed accommodation at all locations. For example,
THORPE PARK Resort focuses especially on the teen and young adult markets whereas Chessington
World of Adventures Resort is orientated more towards families. Each of our Resort Theme Parks,
certain of which are among the leading theme parks in the UK, Italy and Northern Germany, enjoys
high brand and customer awareness in its local market. We also have three Second Gate attractions near
our Resort Theme Parks, including Dungeons Warwick Castle, Dungeons Alton Towers and SEA LIFE
Gardaland.

We believe that each of our Resort Theme Parks offers a compelling, coherent proposition and strong
theming, with few or no local competitors that can offer the same quality or scale of visitor experience.
We aim to implement effective marketing and promotions to ensure that each brand is the strongest in
its relevant market. Our Resort Theme Parks are recognised as destination resorts, attracting short break
visits from national and, in certain cases, international visitors, supported by short break marketing
campaigns. Each of our Resort Theme Parks has one or more hotels or holiday villages.

Each of our Resort Theme Parks is strongly positioned in its national/regional market, often representing
the pre-eminent visitor attraction in its respective region and benefiting from being situated in a
prominent location with good transport links to areas of substantial populations. In particular, we
believe we have a market leading position in the United Kingdom, as we own the top four UK theme
parks (by number of visitors in 2021) according to the TEA/AECOM Report for 2021: LEGOLAND
Windsor (part of our LEGOLAND Parks operating group), Alton Towers Resort, THORPE PARK
Resort and Chessington World of Adventures Resort (all part of our Resort Theme Parks). We also
believe we hold leading market positions in Italy and Northern Germany, in each case by number of
visitors to Europe’s top 20 theme parks in 2021.

The scale of our Resort Theme Parks and available undeveloped land at certain locations has also
provided opportunities for Second Gate attractions. For example, there is a SEA LIFE centre located
close to Gardaland Resort and a Dungeons Warwick Castle on the Warwick Castle site.

**_Intellectual Property Partnerships_**

Given our global reach and multi-format expertise, we believe we are well placed to benefit from the
growing opportunities to partner with leading owners of intellectual property content, which enables us
to deliver memorable experiences to our visitors and offer our partners opportunities to increase
engagement with their customers. We maintain a core global, multi-product and exclusive relationship
with the LEGO Group. In particular, we hold the global, exclusive rights to the LEGOLAND brand
under the licensing and co-operation agreement with KIRKBI, our largest shareholder. We have a
synergistic relationship with the LEGO Group and KIRKBI A/S, which as of 31 December 2022, is a
75 per cent. shareholder of the LEGO Group with a 100 per cent. ownership of the LEGO and
LEGOLAND trademarks and a 47.49 per cent. shareholder of JVco.

We maintain multiple other intellectual property agreements, ranging from local relationships for
specific attractions, to global, multi-product relationships. These include our multi-territory exclusivity
arrangement to develop a range of attractions based on the Peppa Pig brand, an established global brand
aimed at pre-school children. In addition, we established multiple other intellectual property
partnerships, allowing us to use brands such as Ghostbusters, the Gruffalo, Shrek, Bear Grylls, Kung
Fu Panda, Ferrari and CBeebies, the latter through our partnership with BBC Worldwide. We also
continue to develop new global intellectual property partnerships. For example, in 2022 we opened a
“JUMANJI — The Adventure” ride and, in 2023, a “JUMANJI: The Labyrinth” ride in our Gardaland
Theme Resort, as part of our multi-territory exclusivity agreement with Sony Pictures Entertainment, to
develop and operate attractions, rides, lands, retail outlets and themed hotel rooms based on the studio’s
“Jumanji” film franchise. In 2023, we have also opened a “World of Jumanji” themed land at our


-----

Chessington World of Adventures Theme Park Resort, along with Jumanji-themed rooms at the local
resort hotel, and a Jumanji themed rollercoaster.

The below chart shows our key intellectual property partnerships and attractions arrangements:

We intend to continue developing further global, regional and local relationships with additional
intellectual property and content owners over the coming years, by building on the success of our
existing relationships.

**_Long Term Attractive Market Trends_**

We believe that we operate in an attractive market benefiting from underlying growth characteristics
and favourable dynamics, such as long-term increases in leisure spending, including in emerging
economies. Notwithstanding the recent impact of the COVID 19 pandemic, we believe the global leisure
market possesses a number of attractive features that facilitate growth over the long-term. These include
increasing leisure time in both developed and emerging economies, the value placed on time spent
together with friends and family and growing tourism to gateway cities.

This is underpinned by our long-term belief in domestic as well as international tourism, where we
experienced a strong post-COVID recovery during 2022. We continue to see long-term growth
opportunities from tourism more widely, which benefits our resorts and drives visitation to our gateway
city locations, where we operate our Midway attraction clusters.

According to the WTTC, travel and tourism’s contribution to the global economy is forecast to increase
by a CAGR of 5.1 per cent. per annum between 2023 and 2033, which reflects faster growth than that
of the global economy. A key indicator measuring the size of the tourism industry is the number of
international tourist arrivals. According to the UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), in 2019,
tourism growth continued to outpace the global economy, with approximately 1.5 billion international
tourist arrivals, which is an increase of approximately 4 per cent. over the previous year.

We also expect to experience continuing growth in domestic short break holidays (typically composed
of one-to three-day stays). According to the ONS, short breaks taken abroad by UK residents have
grown at a CAGR of 5.5 per cent. per annum from 2009-2019 period, increasing from 6 million short
break holidays taken in 2009 to 10.3 million in 2019. We are increasingly well-positioned to meet this
demand through our combined offering of themed, on-site accommodation and Second Gate attractions
that extend the duration of our visitors’ stay. Accommodation offerings also enable greater cross-selling
opportunities, drive improved levels of guest satisfaction, and lead to increases in pre-bookings, revenue
visibility and positive working capital. Our domestically focused resort positioning also provides a
partial hedge against the impact of macro-economic or geopolitical volatility on international tourism
(including because of COVID-19, as well as the current cost-of-living crisis and inflation) due to the
relatively lower cost of domestic short-break holidays. According to the WTTC, global domestic
tourism increased to a 85 per cent. share in 2021, compared to 72 per cent. in 2019. We believe that our
business has historically demonstrated resilience during periods of economic slowdown and
geopolitical volatility. We believe that consumer spending on family visitor Attractions tends to be


-----

more resistant to cutbacks than many other forms of discretionary spending during periods of economic
downturn because visiting our Attractions may represent a less expensive holiday or leisure alternative
compared to overseas travel holidays for domestic customers in the countries in which we operate.
Additionally, the Attractions may represent a less expensive holiday or leisure alternative compared to
overseas travel holidays for domestic customers in the countries in which we operate.

In addition, we believe that the short break market is growing in many of the countries and regions in
which we operate and, in particular, in key destination cities, such as London, Berlin, Sydney and
Shanghai. According to the Office for National Statistics, in the UK, short breaks taken by UK residents
to visit abroad have grown at an average rate of 5.5 per cent. per annum from 2009-19 period, while the
growth rate of longer holidays (14-27 nights) over the same period was -0.1 per cent. per annum.

We maintain a long-term belief in international tourism. We also seek to benefit from opportunities
arising from tourism more widely, which benefits our Resort Theme Parks and drives visitors to our
gateway city locations (where we operate our Midway Attraction clusters). We estimate that in the 2022
financial year, 77 per cent. of visitors to our Attractions were domestic visitors (as compared with 72
per cent. in the 2019 financial year) and 23 per cent. were international tourists (as compared with 28
per cent. in the 2019 financial year), based on a survey of a sample of our visitors. This survey highlights
a higher weighting of domestic visitors, than we expect for a typical year in the future, as a result of
lower levels in international tourism recorded in recent periods compared to typical pre-pandemic
levels.

While the COVID-19 pandemic had a particularly serious effect on the travel and tourism industry, in
2022, international tourist arrivals totalled 917 million and grew by 102 per cent. compared to 2021,
according to the UNWTO, representing strong recovery. We have Attractions in eight of the top ten
cities ranked as top city destinations for 2022.

Moreover, theme park attendance continues to grow globally. According to the TEA/AECOM Theme
Index and Museum Index: The Global Attractions Attendance Report (2021), attendance at the top 25
global theme parks has grown by 70 per cent., from approximately 83 million visitors in 2020 to
approximately 141 million visitors in 2021. Such strong recovery in 2021 was largely influenced by the
easing up of COVID-related travel restrictions, the success of COVID-19 vaccine administration, and
general consumer confidence levels. According to the 2012-2019 TEA/AECOM Reports, Theme park
attendance on an average grew by 3 per cent. per annum from 2012 to 2019 across all major markets.

**_Strong Market Positions with High Guest Satisfaction Underpinning High Revenue per Capita_**

According to the TEA/AECOM Report for 2019, we were the second largest theme park operator
globally by number of visitors in 2019. We also own eight of Europe’s largest 20 theme parks by number
of visitors as of 2021. Each of our operating groups commands a strong market share within its market
and benefits from competitive advantages. The strength of our brand and our experience in the industry
is supported by a consistent track record of high guest satisfaction and growing revenues per capita. We
believe that our ongoing product investment and innovation, and strong focus on creating memorable
experiences for our guests, have resulted in continued strong levels of guest satisfaction. In 2022 and
2021, we delivered an overall guest satisfaction score across our group of 94 per cent. and a “Net
_Promoter” score above 50 per cent., which measures the propensity for our guests to recommend our_
Attractions. Moreover, our “top box” measure (i.e., the highest level of customer satisfaction that we
record in our customer surveys, indicating when guests are “very satisfied”) and our value for money
rating have also increased in 2022 compared to 2021.


-----

Our guest satisfaction has consistently ranked above our 90 per cent. benchmark since 2008, as shown
by the graph below:

We believe that high guest satisfaction is driven, in part by our ability to deliver shorter queues (with
lower waiting times for rides) and an overall pleasant experience for our visitors. In addition to driving
visitation, we believe that high guest satisfaction scores also contribute to our revenue growth and is
therefore important for our long-term success. In particular, our revenue per capita increased from £22.3
in 2019 to £30.1 in 2022, respectively, underpinning an increasing willingness by visitors who have a
positive experience at our Attractions to spend more (including on our other services and activities).

This increase is also supported by robust customer demand, particularly at our domestically-focused
attractions in the UK, the US and Continental Europe, by our active management of peak day capacity
and by our revenue management initiatives, which allow us to pass increased costs to visitors. Our
revenue management initiatives are also complemented by a dynamic approach to capacity
management, which we tailor to ensure optimal staffing levels and associated costs across our
attractions.

We believe that the strong market position and breadth of the operations of our Resort Theme Parks,
LEGOLAND Parks and Midway Attractions are also supported by our historic investment in each
category. In particular, our existing portfolio of strong brands and use of the LEGO brand offer a
compelling proposition that distinguishes our business. In each of our three operating groups, we benefit
from in house technical and creative capacity, well located sites in attractive markets, permits and
branding relationships.

We also retain a number of competitive advantages in the Midway Attractions operating group. These
advantages include strong brand recognition in connection with existing brands such as Madame
Tussauds, SEA LIFE, the Eye and the LEGO and LEGOLAND brands used by our
LEGO/LEGOLAND Discovery Centres, our own in house Merlin Magic Making team which includes
wax sculptors, our SEA LIFE marine biologists and our ability to operate our Midway Attractions as
part of “clusters,” where multiple Attractions are situated in one city or region to capitalise on crossselling, including through our multi attraction pass opportunities. A popular package amongst customers
is the sale of annual and monthly passes, which are purchased online or at our parks for a one off price
that enables customers to visit all Attractions within a particular country for one year for no additional
admission fee.

In addition, our scale also allows us to capitalise on operating cost efficiencies, including marketing
costs, central management, site development expertise and application of visitor management
experiences across our portfolio.

We also expect to see continuing growth in domestic short break holidays, primarily due to their lower
cost. We believe we are increasingly well-positioned to meet this demand through our offering of
themed, on-site accommodation and Second Gate attractions that extend the duration of our visitors’
stay. Accommodation offerings also enable greater cross-selling opportunities, drive improved levels
of guest satisfaction, and lead to increases in pre-bookings, revenue visibility and positive working


-----

capital. In addition, we believe that domestically-focused resort positioning also provides a partial
hedge against the impact of macro-economic or geopolitical volatility on international tourism.

**_Efficient and Synergistic Operating Model_**

We continue to leverage the scale and synergies within our Group to achieve enhanced revenue
generation as well as operational, marketing and buying power. At the same time, we continue to focus
on operational excellence, delivering memorable experiences for our guests, simplifying our operations
and maximising the synergies afforded by our scale.

We believe that our operating model has developed as our scale has grown, allowing us to operate more
efficiency and flexibly, while maintaining our focus on providing a high-quality experience for our
visitors. In particular, we have re-engineered how we react to changes in guest volumes, applying
dynamic pricing and promotional strategies with a focus on yield management. Our operations are
aimed at managing visitor numbers through periods of high and low attendance volume, extending the
length of stay, encouraging repeat visits, and enhancing overall revenue by also improving our
customers’ online “digital journey.” In addition, we believe that our ability to maintain tight control
over attraction capacities during peak season and lowering peak day volumes delivers a tangible
improvement in the guest experience, increases rides per guest, reduces queuing, and improves average
guest spends.

In key cities including London, Sydney and Tokyo, we developed “clusters” by deploying multiple
Midway Attractions in one urban area or region, with the aim to capitalise on strong cross promotional
and operational synergies, including multi attraction pass opportunities, to drive cross-selling. For
example, in 2022, we opened a Peppa Pig World of Play Attraction in Leidschendam (the Netherlands),
a LEGO Discovery Centre in Brussels (Belgium) and have taken over the management contract of
Amsterdam’s THIS IS HOLLAND flying theatre experience, thereby expanding our local clusters. Our
clustering drive is supplemented by our scale and portfolio diversification of strong brands, which also
allows us to leverage a number of strategic synergies and operate more efficiency and flexibly, while
maintaining our focus on providing a high-quality experience for our visitors.

In addition, we continue to transform our theme parks into destination resorts, thereby extending visitor
market reach and enhancing revenues by unlocking multiple sales channels (including
accommodations), driven by overall visit durations being extended to longer than a single day. We also
invest in ongoing opportunities to drive visitation at our theme parks by opening Second Gate
attractions. For example, we operate a SEA LIFE centre close to Gardaland Resort and a Dungeons
Warwick Castle on the premises of the Warwick Castle site while in 2022 we opened Peppa Pig Theme
Park in Florida, next to LEGOLAND Florida. In addition, we are also planning to open the UK’s first
LEGO themed holiday village at LEGOLAND Windsor Resort in 2024.

Our scale also allows us to benefit from procurement cost efficiencies within clusters, countries, or
regions, while in certain territories our Merlin Annual Pass and Merlin Pass Monthly Memberships
enable our customers to visit all attractions within a particular country for an upfront or monthly fee. In
addition, we maintain Attraction-specific annual passes, allowing visitors to visit a particular attraction
for one year and monthly membership schemes at our North American LEGOLAND Parks. Merlin
Annual Passes can be purchased for a one-off price and enable our customers to visit all Attractions
within a particular country for one year for no additional admission fee, subject to occasional
restrictions, including certain ‘restricted days’. We use the Merlin Annual Pass and the Merlin Pass
Monthly Membership to drive visitor loyalty and brand awareness, to provide us with revenue visibility,
to secure cash flows in advance and to increase levels of secondary spending (including commercial
spending) at the Attractions. We also intend to invest in developing a reliable technological
infrastructure, to support our growth.

We also adopted national promotions at Group level, comprising promotional discounts, or national
marketing campaigns in conjunction with local partners. We also partner with specialist outsourcing


-----

providers in areas such as food and beverage offerings. We believe that higher volumes for an individual
Attraction can be achieved through the use of entry promotions and admission fee discounts. and we
can use such promotions and discounts to distribute visitor attendance across an Attraction’s opening
hours or opening period.

We have also been transforming our support functions through shared service centre initiatives such as
our recent “finance transformation project”. To date, over two-thirds of the value of our revenues are
generated from Attractions whose accounting is managed through our shared service centre.

**_Wide-ranging In-house Development Capabilities_**

We offer an end-to-end value proposition, ranging from research and development to innovation, which
we leverage to run our world class Attractions. In particular, our three operating groups are supported
by teams including our in-house innovation and product delivery group, MMM, which includes teams
across Europe, North America and the Asia Pacific region. Together, such teams capture a unique
combination of skills, including research, creative, production and project management, delivering an
end-to-end value proposition from conceptualisation, development and day-to-day running of
attractions.

We maintain specific resources within our operating groups that are dedicated to researching future
opportunities, searching out locations for potential new attractions and negotiating with local landlords,
developers and civic bodies. Our LEGOLAND Parks, in addition to the LEGO Discovery Center,
Brussels, which opened in 2022 and the LEGO Discovery Center in Springfield, Washington D.C.,
which is expected to open in 2023, represent prime examples of these efforts. In addition, our MMM
team is our in-house specialist team in charge of activities which include the creation of compelling
propositions and development of new concepts into commercially viable attractions. MMM also
supports our other team in pursuing acquisition and investment opportunities, while cooperating in
creative design, production, and project management tasks. Our in-house production capabilities
include bespoke content such as wax figures, attraction theming and LEGO model production, thereby
creating efficiencies and reducing costs. For example, the castle rooms at our Warwick Castle Resort
contain a variety of exhibits and artefacts, including bespoke wax figures depicting aspects of the
castle’s history that have been produced by our MMM team. Our MMM team’s inputs were also
instrumental in finalizing major projects including the “Jumanji” themed rides and accommodations at
our Gardaland and Chessington World of Adventure Theme Park Resorts and our first Peppa Pig Theme
Park as a Second Gate attraction in close proximity to our LEGOLAND Florida site and the “LEGO
_Ferrari Build and Race” at our LEGOLAND California Resort, as well as for new Midway Attractions_
we recently deployed and our Peppa Pig World of Play sites. We also maintain teams focusing on
developing and monitoring our health, safety and security programmes, with the aim to deliver industry
leading health, safety and security standards, and work closely with our recruiting and training teams,
to ensure our workforce has the right skills to be the best at what they do and fulfil their potential in
their career with us.

Through our in-house capabilities, we are able to develop and run attractions of varying scale, also
managing the related construction processes. In 2022, we completed the construction and opened
LEGOLAND Korea, which is fully owned and operated by us and, as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, we are developing three LEGOLAND Parks in China in cooperation with local partners.

We also believe that our extensive experience in the leisure and entertainment industry represents an
opportunity for investors to develop joint entertainment offerings. For example, we are developing three
LEGOLAND Parks in China in cooperation with local partners (LEGOLAND Sichuan resort,
LEGOLAND Shanghai resort and LEGOLAND Shenzhen resort).

**_Well-Diversified Portfolio_**

Through our broad portfolio of Attractions, our overall business is diversified across geography,
attraction type, brand and customer demographic. This diversification helps us deliver strong financial
results across a variety of different market conditions and to minimise the impact of external factors,
such as regional economic performance, extreme weather and other external factors. We estimate that
in the 2022 financial year, 77 per cent. of visitors to our Attractions were domestic visitors and 23 per
cent. were international tourists, based on a survey of a sample of our visitors.

As of 1 April 2023, we operate in 24 countries globally, including 15 countries in Europe and North
America and nine countries in the Asia Pacific region, drawing both domestic and international visitors
in each location. In the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2023, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe
(excluding the United Kingdom), North America and the Asia Pacific region accounted for 29 per cent.,
23 per cent., 35 per cent. and 13 per cent. of our revenue, respectively.

Our Attractions range in format from city centre to destination resorts and coastal Attractions, capturing
both the urban and resort-based tourist market and appealing to visitors ranging from families with
young children to teenagers and adults. In addition, on site, themed accommodation has historically
improved guest satisfaction and contributed to our revenue growth. In the 53 weeks ended 31 December
2022, we generated 15 per cent. of our revenue from our accommodation offering (mainly through
overnight stays), 81 per cent. from our visitors (through admissions tickets, retail, food and beverage
sales and other commercial offerings at our Attractions) and 4 per cent. from other sources (mainly
including sponsorships and development contract revenues).

Our Attractions are also partially insulated against extreme weather or seasonal changes through a
mixture of formats, with 45 per cent. of our revenue having been derived from our LEGOLAND Parks
and 22 per cent. of our revenue having been derived from our Resort Theme Parks operations, both of
which are primarily organised around outdoor activities, and 33 per cent. of our revenue having been
derived from our Midway Attractions operating group, which is primarily organised around indoor
activities, in the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2023. In the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2023, 67 per cent. of our
revenue came from outdoor sites, and 33 per cent. from indoor sites. Most of our Attractions are
scheduled to remain open year-round, other than our European Theme Parks, LEGOLAND New York
and LEGOLAND Korea, which tend to be closed during the winter. In the 53 weeks ended 31 December
2022, 58 per cent. of our revenue came from sites that are open all year round.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had experienced a trend towards increased pre-booked revenues,
leading to reduced volatility in Attraction revenues. This trend continued in the 2022 financial year, as
the global economy recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic. In the 53 weeks ended 31 December
2022, 79 per cent. of total admissions revenue were generated prior to visitation from pre bookings or
annual passes, also resulting in a positive financial contribution to working capital. An increase in pre
bookings adds visibility to cash flows and provides resilience against external factors, such as the impact
of weather.

**_Consistent Financial Track Record with Flexible Cost Base_**

We have a strong financial track record as we recover from the impact of COVID-19, with reported
revenue recovering to £2,006 million in the 2022 financial year, reflecting a growth of 219.1 per cent.
between 2020 and 2022. We have also demonstrated an ability to rapidly recover and improve EBITDA
following periods of macroeconomic volatility, geo-political uncertainty and challenging trading
conditions within our operating groups (including, most recently, as a result of COVID-19). For
example, Adjusted EBITDA grew significantly between 2020 and 2022 from a loss of £102 million to
£692 million.

Our gross margins have been stable, supported by elevated revenue per capita, certain cost saving
initiatives and the outsourcing of certain food & beverage operations. In 2020, building on work that


-----

was already underway, we deployed structural cost saving measures to refine the operating model across
all Attractions, with the aim to create a lower fixed cost and more flexible cost base. Such measures
have partially offset ongoing inflationary headwinds. Staff expenses are the largest portion of costs and
we manage these dynamically by optimising our variable workforce, based on flexible agreements,
multi and cross skilling and rostering tools.

Our marketing spend was significantly reduced in 2020 and 2021 reflecting lower trading levels, but
started to return to more typical levels in 2022.

In addition, while energy contracts we renewed in the second half of 2022 and Q1 2023 have resulted
in significant price increases, utilities costs do not represent a significant portion of our cost base, and
amounted to 3 per cent. of revenues for the 2022 financial year.

**_Prudent Capital Allocation and Flexible Capital Expenditure Spend Resulting in Strong and_**
**_Recurring Cash Flow Generation_**

Our track record of delivering attractive returns from efficient investment is a result of a disciplined
internal focus on investment criteria, return thresholds and hurdles; in house expertise in capital
expenditure efficiency, project delivery, yield and variable cost management; and experience in
maximising the returns from marketing spend.

As part of our capital allocation strategy, we aim to maintain prudent investment practices throughout
our Existing Estate, by leveraging our strong brand portfolio. In addition, we are transforming our
Resort Theme Parks into short break destinations, by strengthening our short break proposition while
diversifying our product offering. We are also expanding our accommodation offering and Second Gate
Attractions footprint, to extend visitation time and increase revenue growth by unlocking cross-selling
opportunities. This has resulted in increases in accommodation revenue and pre-bookings, while
increasing our revenue and cash flow visibility and reduce volatility levels. We also believe that our
diverse offering of themed, on-site accommodation at our Resort Theme Parks further contributes to
the increase in revenues per capita, by enabling greater cross-selling opportunities. Further, our own inhouse Merlin Magic Making team delivers innovative new product ideas including ride concept and
design and wax figure manufacture, and therefore yields synergies and cost savings over third parties
that would otherwise be engaged to develop our Attractions. We also maximise our marketing spend
through targeted campaigns focused on educating prospective customers about new Attractions and
rides. Throughout this process, we take advantage of our market leverage and our scale to maximize
operational, marketing, product and cost synergies. In particular, we implement cost efficiencies such
as shared marketing costs, central management, site development expertise and application of visitor
management experiences across the portfolio. In addition to the benefits we derive from our core
competencies, we maintain our estate through regular planned maintenance capital expenditure, which
means that incremental capital expenditure can be targeted at driving incremental revenue opportunities.

In deploying our capital and planning our investments, we leverage strategic synergies across our three
operating groups, for example by developing “clusters” of Attractions in key locations, and through the
opening of on-site Second Gate attractions. A typical LEGOLAND Park generally requires lower
capital expenditure than a Resort Theme Park, because it is geared towards families with young children
and does not require expensive, large format roller coasters. Our Resort Theme Parks tend to be
nationally pre-eminent in their respective markets and therefore lack the significant competitive
intensity of the theme park operators in the United States. As a result, we do not need to compete solely
on the basis of the latest and largest coasters but can open significant new coasters on an opportunistic
basis. In addition, although not directly comparable to other theme park operators, a typical Midway
Attraction does not require substantial ongoing capital expenditure due to the lack of large scale
coasters, or rides, and the low overall degree of capital employed in each site. Capital expenditure
programmes for the Midway Attractions operating group vary between Attractions, depending on the
size and anticipated growth of the Attraction. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Capital Expenditure.” We believe we maintain an efficient_


-----

working capital profile, supported by a high proportion of admissions revenue (79 per cent. in 2022)
being generated prior to visitations from pre-bookings or annual passes.

Capital expenditure across our portfolio of Attractions is primarily funded out of our operating free cash
flow. Our total reported capital expenditure for the 2022 financial year was £195 million, of which £55
million was used for New Business Development, including new Attractions and new accommodations,
which included LEGOLAND Korea, and £140 million was used for our Existing Estate. We maintain
prudent investment practices throughout our Existing Estate, by leveraging our strong brand portfolio.
Our Existing Estate capital expenditure, which covers adding new rides and attractions, replace outdated
features and general maintenance activities, was 12 per cent., 6 per cent. and 7 per cent. of revenue in
the 2020, 2021 and 2022 financial years, respectively. Our successful and flexible capital expenditure
programme has translated into consistently positive cash conversion with operating free cash flow
conversion of 81 per cent. and 79 per cent. in the 2021 and 2022 financial years, respectively.

**_Highly Experienced and Diverse Management Team Backed by Equity Owners with In-depth_**
**_Knowledge of the Company_**

Our senior management team is highly experienced within both the attractions industry and our
businesses, with decades of combined sector experience, supplemented with relevant experience from
outside the attractions industry. See “Management.” Our Chief Executive Officer, Scott M. O’Neil was
appointed in November 2022. Scott has over 25 years of experience in leading and managing global
sports and entertainment brands. Our Chief Financial Officer, Alistair Windybank was appointed in
November 2020. He joined the Group in 2008 and has previously held various senior finance roles
within the Group including Head of Corporate Finance, Group Investor Relations Director, Senior
Finance Director Capital Projects and Deputy Chief Financial Officer. Our senior management team
drives the development and execution of our strategy to deliver growth both organically and through
acquisitions.

Our senior management team is supported by local management teams, which run our operating groups
and Attractions. Each Resort Theme Park, LEGOLAND Park and regional or functional division of the
Midway Attractions operating group has a divisional director, who is supported by a management team
and who reports directly to the relevant operating group managing director. This decentralised
management structure empowers site management to make commercial and operational decisions
locally, enabling real time reaction to local market conditions. Our senior management team is also
supported by the Merlin Magic Making team, which is our unique, creative and project management
resource. Merlin Magic Making also provides creative design and production. Our strong local
management teams are often a result of our culture of training and development, with central and local
programmes to develop skills at all levels of the organisation. The commitment of our employees is
best demonstrated by the results of the 2022 annual staff survey. More than 18,000 employees
completed the survey, a response rate of 84 per cent. Our employee engagement is one of our key
performance indicators measuring whether our teams think we are a “great place to perform,” “a great
_place for customers” and a “great place to work.” In 2022, our engagement was 68 per cent. favourable,_
an encouraging increase of 5 per cent. compared to 2021.

We also enjoy strong shareholder support and commitment, by highly experienced through-cycle
investors contributing substantial governance and oversight. Since 2019, we have been controlled by a
consortium of three principal long-term investors with the capability to support our growth ambitions.
These investors are KIRKBI, Blackstone and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP
Investments). Blackstone had previously been our majority shareholder since a management backed
buy out investment in 2005. At the same time, we acquired rights to LEGOLAND Parks from KIRKBI
A/S, who signed the licensing and co-operation agreement with us, and KIRKBI became one of our
shareholders. See “Business—History—Our Relationship with the KIRKBI Group.” Blackstone and
KIRKBI continued to jointly control Merlin for eight years from 2005 to 2013, during which period we
successfully grew, with a revenue CAGR of 12.5 per cent. from 2008 to 2013, to become the second
largest theme park operator globally by number of visitors in 2019. Blackstone has longstanding


-----

experience investing in the visitor attractions industry as well as the broader hospitality, travel and
leisure sectors. Blackstone’s previous investments include Merlin Entertainments, SeaWorld, Six Flags,
Universal Orlando, Center Parcs, Hilton Hotels and The Cosmopolitan Hotel.

**Our Strategy**

**_Existing Estate Growth Driven by Access to Powerful Intellectual Property_**

We believe in the growth of our Existing Estate, to strengthen our global position and improve our offer
to all our visitors. We continue to invest in our existing Attractions to grow demand, increase capacity
and to refresh and improve the visitor experience, which we believe is a key driver for increased visitor
numbers and revenue growth. We also aim to fully unlock the benefits of combining our brand
experience with the strength of our Attractions portfolio, and are driven by a constant focus to refresh
and retool our portfolio to maintain and expand our attractiveness. While we strive to improve our
product appeal, maintain our high levels of customer satisfaction and drive organic growth, we also
have developed prudent investment practices. Investments are planned well in advance, where possible,
according to the forecasted potential returns and the capital requirements of the respective Attraction,
operating groups and location. Existing Estate capital expenditure is divided between adding new rides
or displays and enhancements to our Attractions, replacing old features with newer, more compelling
ones and general maintenance, including ensuring health and safety standards are met or exceeded. Our
capital expenditure practices are designed to develop the product portfolio over time so as to increase
visitor numbers and visitors’ length of stay and to support value added increases in admissions fee prices
and commercial spend, thereby delivering growth in revenue and profitability.

We are increasingly able to develop these investments in partnership with leading intellectual property
owners to provide an immersive, themed experience for our visitors. For example, in 2022 we opened
a “JUMANJI — The Adventure” ride and, in 2023, a “JUMANJI: The Labyrinth” ride in our Gardaland
Theme Resort, as part of our multi-territory exclusivity agreement with Sony Pictures Entertainment, to
develop and operate attractions, rides, lands, retail outlets and themed hotel rooms based on the studio’s
“Jumanji” film franchise. In 2023, we have also opened a “World of Jumanji” themed land at our
Chessington Theme Park Resort, along with Jumanji-themed rooms at the local resort hotel, and plan
to open a Jumanji themed rollercoaster in 2023. In addition, in May 2022 we opened “LEGO Ferrari
_Build and Race” at our LEGOLAND California Resort. Featuring a life-size LEGO Ferrari F40 model,_
this interactive attraction aims offer visitors a full “in the driver’s seat” experience, by allowing to build,
test and race LEGO Ferrari models.

In addition to major rides and developments, we also make smaller investments at most Attractions to
support a continually refreshed marketing message and sustained level of visitor satisfaction such as the
Warner Bros. Icons of Horror attraction at Madame Tussauds New York or Rainforest Adventure at
SEA LIFE London Aquarium. We intend to continue maintaining the existing standards of general
maintenance and commitments to ensure health and safety standards and making strategic, value
accretive investments in our Existing Estate and in respect of New Business Development to maintain
and strengthen our leading positions in the industry in which we operate.

In addition, we aim to keep a committed workforce by remaining a great place to work, with high levels
of employee engagement. We believe our employee satisfaction is also driven by our rigid health, safety
and security programmes (based on our “Protecting the Magic” vision), our commitment towards the
environment and animal welfare and our strong focus on developing our front-line team (including
through career acceleration opportunities).

**_Evolution of Theme Parks to Destination Resorts_**

We aim to enhance our operational excellence, by unlocking value across our pricing, data and retail
strategies. We continue to transform our Theme Parks into destination resorts, extending visitor market
reach and enhancing revenues from a number of sales channels. These include primary admissions


-----

(including multi-day tickets and second gate admission fees), and commercial spend such as the sale of
food and beverages, retail merchandise, and souvenirs such as photos.

In addition, the themed accommodation offerings in our hotels and holiday villages continue to be very
successful. We believe these provide an integral contribution to the overall visitor experience, helping
to drive pre-bookings, increase multi-day ticket sales and improve guest satisfaction.

We are developing and plan to open in May 2024 a LEGOLAND Woodland Village, the UK’s first
LEGO themed holiday village, at LEGOLAND Windsor Resort. LEGOLAND Woodland Village will
feature 150 lodges, an on-site restaurant, and a family entertainment hub.

We also intend to benefit from ongoing opportunities to add new visitor attractions at our theme parks,
for which additional admission fees are charged. These attractions, such as waterparks, are referred to
as Second Gate attractions.

As of 1 April 2023, we offered a total of 5,342 rooms across our Theme Parks, including themed on-site
accommodation at all LEGOLAND Parks. In addition, our Heide Park, Warwick Castle and Alton
Towers resorts, along with our LEGOLAND Deutschland, LEGOLAND Billund, and LEGOLAND
Florida parks each include a holiday village, ranging from 65 to 367 rooms. We believe these hotels
and holiday villages provide an integral contribution to the overall customer experience, help drive
pre-booking, increase multi-day ticket sales and improve guest satisfaction. We believe that this
destination positioning has already extended visitor market reach to over five hours drive time and has
enhanced revenues from both primary admissions, including multi-day tickets and second gate
admission fees, and commercial spend. The latter is typically comprised of the sale of food and
beverages, merchandise and souvenirs as a result of longer average lengths of stay.

**_Clustering of Midway Attractions_**

Our growth strategy includes the opening of our chainable Midway attractions in new locations and
countries including key gateway cities, often creating ‘clusters’, where multiple attractions are
developed in one location. We have developed “clusters” of Midway Attractions in Amsterdam,
Arizona, Bangkok, Berlin, Birmingham, Blackpool, Dallas, Istanbul, Kansas City, London,
Manchester, Melbourne, Michigan, New Jersey, Oberhausen, Orlando, San Antonio, Shanghai, Sydney
and Tokyo, where multiple Attractions are situated in one city or region to capitalise on strong cross
promotional and operational synergies, including multi-attraction tickets to drive cross selling. For
example, in 2022, we opened a Peppa Pig World of Play Attraction in Leidschendam (the Netherlands),
a LEGO Discovery Centre in Brussels (Belgium) and have taken over the management contract of
Amsterdam’s THIS IS HOLLAND flying theatre experience, thereby expanding our local cluster of
attractions.

**_LEGOLAND Park Developments_**

We aim to fully unleash the potential of our LEGOLAND Parks footprint, leveraging on our proven
track record of developing and operating LEGOLAND Parks globally. We opened new LEGOLAND
Parks in Florida in 2011, in Malaysia in 2012, in Dubai in 2016, in Nagoya, Japan in 2017, in New York
in 2021 and in South Korea in 2022. LEGOLAND Malaysia and LEGOLAND Dubai are operated
under management contracts. In addition, we are also developing three LEGOLAND Parks in China in
cooperation with local partners. Each of LEGOLAND Sichuan resort, LEGOLAND Shanghai resort
and LEGOLAND Shenzhen resort is expected to open during or after 2025. All three will be operated
under a management contract model.

We have three operating and investment models with respect to the development of LEGOLAND Parks.

Firstly, in more proven locations, we follow an “owned and operated” model. Under this approach, we
make the necessary capital investment to secure the land and develop the infrastructure ourselves. We


-----

have used this model in our European and North American LEGOLAND Parks as well as for
LEGOLAND Korea (which has been developed under this model with support from local authorities).

Secondly, we work with a local partner, marrying their capabilities and expertise with our strengths and
experience to both parties’ mutual benefit. Typically, the funding for the capital investment is provided
by a third party and we operate the park under a management contract. We do not own the park but
instead operate it pursuant to a development and management contract with our partners. We operate
LEGOLAND Malaysia under this model. The Malaysian government provided the funds to develop
LEGOLAND Malaysia. We own a 20 per cent. interest in the company that owns LEGOLAND
Malaysia. LEGOLAND Dubai is operated under a similar management contract model, whereby LL
Dubai Theme Park LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of DXB Entertainments, owns the assets and we
operate the park. We do not have an equity interest in LEGOLAND Dubai but hold a 40 per cent.,
equity interest in LL Dubai Hotel LLC, the company that developed the hotel at LEGOLAND Dubai
(opened in 2022) and owns the hotel’s premises. See “Business—Material Contracts.”

Third, we can operate parks under a “leased and operated” model. Under this approach, the acquisition
of the park site, the development of the infrastructure and the basic construction is funded by a third
party partner. We fund and build the rides and the necessary theming, lease the site on a long-term basis,
and operate the LEGOLAND Park. LEGOLAND Japan, for example, was developed using this
approach with a subsidiary of KIRKBI as the lessor.

**_Acquisitions and New Format Opportunities_**

We continue to consider acquisitions of, or investments in, visitor attractions, sites and brands that could
strategically enhance our portfolio and enable us to grow into new geographies, and reallocate our
capital expenditure accordingly. Over the course of our operating history, we have demonstrated a track
record of identifying, implementing and integrating both large and small acquisitions and delivering
significant value uplift through improving acquired operations, while maintaining a standard level of
excellence across our estate. We believe that there remain further attractive acquisition opportunities
that would meet our investment criteria in the future.

In 2022 we completed the acquisition of the COEX Aquarium in Seoul, South Korea, adding a further
significant attraction to the SEA LIFE portfolio, and consistent with our wider strategy to build clusters
of Midway indoor attractions in key gateway cities.

In 2022, we also acquired the operations and brand licence of Cadbury World (a popular attraction in
the UK) pursuant to an exclusive partnership with Mondelēz International, thereby deepening our
relationship with a leading UK chocolate brand. As part of the agreement, we will be responsible for
the day-to-day running of the Cadbury World site, its employees, and all operational decisions, as well
as holding brand usage rights for Cadbury World in the UK. The Cadbury World attraction has been
added to our Midway Attractions portfolio.

We also develop new formats of attraction, where currently our focus is on Peppa Pig branded
attractions aimed at pre-school children. We have opened five pilot indoor Peppa Pig World of Play
attractions, and one standalone Peppa Pig theme park that opened next to LEGOLAND Florida Resort
in early 2022. We plan to open our second Peppa Pig theme park in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in 2024.

**History**

**_Overview_**

Since our formation in 1999, our strategy has been to create a high growth, high return, family
entertainment company based on strong brands and a global portfolio of assets that is naturally hedged
against the impact of external factors. Our company was formed in 1999 when a management buyout
from Vardon Attractions Limited (“Vardon Attractions”) led to the formation of Merlin Entertainments.
At that time, our business comprised 17 SEA LIFE Centres in the United Kingdom, Germany, the


-----

Republic of Ireland, The Netherlands, Belgium and Spain, and the London Dungeon and York
Dungeon. From 1999 to 2005, we undertook a major expansion of our SEA LIFE and Dungeons brands,
which continue to be important brands in our business today. As a result of subsequent growth and
acquisitions, we now have a mixture of brands and Attractions that range from small visitor attractions
to national theme parks. Our ownership has changed a number of times since our formation in 1999,
with Hermes Private Equity acquiring the business in 2004 and Blackstone becoming a majority
shareholder in May 2005. On November 2013, we completed our initial public offering and listing of
the Merlin Shares on the London Stock Exchange. On November 2019, the transaction to take Merlin
private became effective and Merlin’s shares were delisted from the London Stock Exchange. Merlin
is now under the ownership of the Consortium, which shares the long-term strategic vision of Merlin
becoming the global leader in location based entertainment.

**_Acquisitions and Strategic Development_**

We have a longstanding history of successfully expanding our portfolio of brands and geographic
footprint, through highly accretive M&A transactions and strategic capital deployment. From May 2005
to May 2007, we completed a number of acquisitions, including the LEGOLAND Parks from the
KIRKBI Group in August 2005 and Gardaland Resort, Italy’s largest theme park by number of visitors
in 2021, together with its accompanying hotel, in November 2006. We further strengthened our portfolio
of assets in May 2007 by acquiring The Tussauds Group from Dubai International Capital. As part of
the acquisitions of the LEGOLAND Parks and The Tussauds Group, each of KIRKBI and Dubai
International Capital, respectively, became shareholders.

Since January 2011, we have completed the following strategic acquisitions or developments across our
brands:

- in March 2011, we acquired the Sydney Attractions Group, adding six Attractions to our
portfolio. These Attractions have since been rebranded. We have now exited from two of these
six Attractions, the small Attractions of SEA LIFE Manly and WILD LIFE Hamilton Island;

- in October 2011, we opened LEGOLAND Florida, built on the site of the former Cypress
Gardens theme park;

- in February 2012, we acquired Living and Leisure Australia, adding a further nine Attractions
to our portfolio (of which the Australian ski resorts at Mount Hotham and Falls Creek were
sold in April 2019). These Attractions have since been rebranded;

- in September 2012, we opened our first Theme Park in Asia with the opening of LEGOLAND
Malaysia, which we operate under a management contract, although we hold a minority equity
interest in IDR, which, together with its subsidiaries, owns the park;

- in October 2016, we opened LEGOLAND Dubai Resort, which is being operated under a
management contract, although we hold a minority equity interest in the hotel that opened at
the site in 2022;

- in 2017, we opened LEGOLAND Japan, which is managed under our “leased and operated”
model;

- in 2021, we opened LEGOLAND New York;

- in 2021, we opened six Attractions that had been delayed from 2020 as a result of the COVID19 pandemic: three LEGOLAND Discovery Centres located in the San Francisco Bay Area,
New Jersey and Scheveningen (the Netherlands), respectively, two SEA LIFE centres located
in San Antonio and New Jersey in the USA, and one Madame Tussauds attraction in Dubai;


-----

- In 2021, we opened a Peppa Pig World of Play in Chicago and a LEGOLAND Discovery Centre
in Hong Kong;

- in 2022, we opened LEGOLAND Korea;

- In 2022, we opened our first standalone Peppa Pig theme park, as a second gate attraction
adjacent to LEGOLAND Florida resort and a Peppa Pig World of Play attraction in
Leidschendam (the Netherlands);

- In 2022, we opened a LEGO Discovery Brussels, Belgium, our first “next generation”
LEGOLAND Discovery Centre;

- in 2022 we completed the acquisition of the COEX Aquarium in Seoul, South Korea, adding a
further significant attraction to our SEA LIFE portfolio;

- in 2022 we also acquired the operations and brand licence of Cadbury World (a popular
attraction in the UK) pursuant to an exclusive partnership with Mondelēz International, thereby
deepening our relationship with a leading UK chocolate brand.

We have also continued to invest in the Existing Estate with a number of new rides and features at
Attractions. For example, in 2021 we opened the LEGOLAND Water Park at the Gardaland Resort (the
first LEGO themed water park in Europe). In addition, following a multi-territory exclusivity agreement
with Sony Pictures Entertainment, in 2022 we opened “JUMANJI — The Adventure” at our Gardaland
Resort (Italy) and “LEGO Ferrari Build and Race” at our LEGOLAND California park. Lastly, in 2023
we opened a “World of Jumanji” themed land at our Chessington World of Adventures Resort.

In addition, we have made significant investments in accommodation to increase the number of short
break and multi day visitors. In particular, in 2022, we opened a 154 room hotel at LEGOLAND Korea.
In addition, in 2021, we opened a 250 room hotel at LEGOLAND New York. We intend to continue
this investment in themed accommodation on a selective basis to further our strategic goals.

**_Our Relationship with the KIRKBI Group_**

We have the right to use the LEGOLAND trademark and to the ancillary use of the LEGO trademark
to develop and operate LEGOLAND Parks, as well as other visitor attractions, on an exclusive and
worldwide basis until at least 2075 in return for the payment of a royalty, subject to a licencing and cooperation agreement with KIRKBI A/S. The license is subject to certain termination rights, though our
Directors believe that such termination is highly unlikely. See “—Material Contracts—Intellectual
_Property” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Market and Our Business—Our use of the_
_LEGOLAND and LEGO trademarks, content and other intellectual property rights are subject to the_
_terms and conditions of the LCA.” The strength of the LEGOLAND and LEGO brands, combined with_
our expertise in operating branded Attractions, has led to a successful relationship with the KIRKBI
Group. This is reflected in continued investment in and development of the existing LEGOLAND Parks
and associated accommodation since acquisition, the subsequent take private transaction and the
profitable growth delivered across the LEGOLAND Parks since acquisition. Revenue from the
LEGOLAND Parks operating group increased to £924 million for the 2022 financial year from £537
million for the 2021 financial year and £228 million for the 2020 financial year.

In addition, we have successfully developed the LEGOLAND Discovery Centre brand, which as of 1
April 2023, included 28 Attractions deployed across 10 countries. In addition, in 2022 we opened a
LEGO Discovery Centre in Brussels (Belgium), which we consider the first centre of the “next
_generation” of this brand. We have actively promoted the LEGOLAND Parks with the development_
and opening of LEGOLAND Florida in October 2011, LEGOLAND Malaysia in September 2012,
LEGOLAND Dubai in 2016, LEGOLAND Japan in 2017, LEGOLAND New York in 2021 and
LEGOLAND Korea in 2022. In addition, we are also developing three LEGOLAND Parks in China in
cooperation with local partners. Each of LEGOLAND Sichuan resort, LEGOLAND Shanghai resort


-----

and LEGOLAND Shenzhen resort is expected to open during or after 2025. All three will be operated
under our management contract model. We are also planning to open the UK’s first LEGO themed
holiday village at LEGOLAND Windsor Resort in 2024. The LEGOLAND Woodland Village will
feature 150 lodges, an on-site restaurant, and a family entertainment hub on a 10-acre site.

Lastly, we also believe that our relationship and arrangements with KIRKBI are of mutual benefit to us
and to the KIRKBI Group due to the broader global exposure of the LEGOLAND and LEGO brands
and the benefit of the continued success of our market leading Attractions. The relationship with the
KIRKBI Group has enabled us to develop and operate uniquely branded, interactive family theme parks.
For example, the development of a LEGOLAND Park in Japan has been funded through a “leased and
_operated” model whereby we invested approximately one third of the value of the park and lease the_
balance of the assets from a property company which is a subsidiary of KIRKBI, paying a turnover
based rent. See “—Material Contracts” and “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”

KIRKBI A/S holds a 75 per cent. ownership share in the LEGO Group and a 100 per cent. ownership
of the LEGO and LEGOLAND trademarks and through KIRKBI, holds 47.49 per cent. of the shares in
JVco.

**Our Brands and Attractions**

**_Midway Attractions_**

We have recognisable and well regarded brands in the industry, including SEA LIFE, Madame
Tussauds, The Dungeons, LEGO/LEGOLAND Discovery Centre and the Eye. The Midway Attractions
operating group consists of chainable, branded, predominantly city centre and coastal visitor attractions,
which draw tourists as well as visitors from the local markets. As of 1 April 2023, we operated 125
Midway Attractions across 23 countries.

Each individual Midway Attraction is a self-contained, mainly indoor facility, ranging from 10,000 to
100,000 square feet, requiring a much lower initial investment than in the Resort Theme Parks and
LEGOLAND Parks operating groups.

Midway Attractions are also typically less reliant on repeat visitors than our Theme Parks, require lower
ongoing capital expenditure to maintain guest satisfaction and require lower marketing expenditure to
attract visitors, as a result of their locations in city centres, coastal towns and destination malls that
experience high levels of foot traffic from both tourists and visitors from the local markets. The
integrated nature of each Midway Attraction and resulting ability to control visitor flow also contribute
to each Midway Attraction’s low ongoing operating costs. With relatively low visitor length of stay of
generally up to two hours, each Midway Attraction can accommodate a high turnover of visitors each
day, enhancing their revenue generating potential.

Midway Attractions generate revenue at both the start and conclusion of each visit, through admission
fees and merchandise sales, respectively, and tend to generate a relatively high cash spend given the
short length of stay. In the 2022 financial year, 96 per cent. of our revenue at our Midway Attractions
comprised visitor revenue. In the 2022 financial year, we generated £604 million of visitor revenue at
our Midway Attractions. At larger sites, we offer evening corporate events and functions to increase
site usage. In aggregate, our Midway Attractions attracted 28.7 million visitors in the 2022 financial
year. In the 2022 financial year, the revenue per capita at a Midway Attraction was £21.18.

In the 2022 financial year, we opened three new Midway Attractions, which comprised the Peppa Pig
theme park, a Second Gate attraction adjacent to LEGOLAND Florida Resort, Peppa Pig World of Play
Leidschendam opened in the Netherlands and the LEGO Discovery Centre Brussels opened in Belgium,
which represents first “next generation” LEGO Discovery Centre opened in the country. In addition, in
2022 we acquired the COEX Aquarium in Seoul, South Korea and took over the management contract
to operate the THIS IS HOLLAND flying theatre experience in the Netherlands, thereby strengthening


-----

our Amsterdam attractions cluster. Over the same period, certain smaller Midway Attractions have been
closed or divested, primarily as a result of reduced customer demand following COVID-19 or as part
of our business strategy.

_SEA LIFE_

SEA LIFE is our most visited Midway Attraction brand and has historically generated greater revenue
than any of our other Midway Attraction brands. SEA LIFE combines theming and marine biology
expertise to provide an educational and entertaining family experience. The first SEA LIFE Centre (now
closed) was opened in Oban, Scotland in 1979. Our next SEA LIFE Centre was opened in 1983 and
still operates today. As of 1 April 2023, we maintained 47 SEA LIFE Attractions across the globe. This
included one operated as a second gate at Gardaland Resort as part of the Resort Theme Parks operating
group. and three attractions operated as “second gates” within the LEGOLAND Parks operating group,
and specifically at each of LEGOLAND California, LEGOLAND Japan and LEGOLAND Malaysia.

In April 2022 we completed the acquisition of the COEX Aquarium in Seoul, South Korea, adding a
further significant attraction to the SEA LIFE portfolio, and consistent with our wider strategy to
enhance our clusters of Midway indoor attractions in key gateway locations globally.

SEA LIFE Centres are able to attract repeat visitors by refreshing their displays and by regularly
opening new displays which can be rotated across all of our SEA LIFE Centres. We are also
continuously improving our existing SEA LIFE Centres with new Attractions such as our “Ocean
_Invaders” feature at SEA LIFE London Aquarium or Shark Dive Xtreme at SEA LIFE Sydney_
Aquarium.

SEA LIFE Centres typically target city centre tourists, families with young children and schools and
we believe their easily communicated concept is ideal for entering new markets through new
developments and infill acquisitions.

SEA LIFE champions the cause of marine conservation through education and awareness. This is
emphasised by the “Breed, Rescue, Protect” programme that is at the heart of SEA LIFE business
models across the estate and demonstrates to visitors the conservation values of the brand. In addition,
we operate to world class welfare standards through our animal care network and support the work of
our pioneering marine conservation charity partner, the SEA LIFE TRUST, in its mission to protect
marine life and habitats across the world. In 2022, through SEA LIFE and SEA LIFE TRUST we
launched a conservation programme focused on funding local projects in countries around the world,
which included the world's first rewilding of endangered zebra sharks by the SEA LIFE Sydney
Aquarium team.

_Madame Tussauds_

Madame Tussauds is one of our most famous brands and has provided entertainment through the display
of life size wax figures to visitors for over 200 years. Madame Tussauds has strong relevance to today’s
popular culture in both mature and emerging markets and is frequently endorsed by celebrities,
providing significant public relations opportunities. The first Madame Tussauds was established in
London in 1835 and it has been at its present location since 1884. It has become an iconic London
tourist attraction. At the time of our acquisition of the Tussauds Group in 2007, there were six Madame
Tussauds attractions. As of 1 April 2023, there were 22 Madame Tussauds Attractions in twelve
countries worldwide, including Madame Tussauds Dubai, which opened in 2022. Madame Tussauds
are currently located in Amsterdam, Bangkok, Beijing, Berlin, Blackpool, Dubai, Hollywood, Hong
Kong, Istanbul, London, Las Vegas, Nashville, New York, Orlando, San Francisco, Shanghai,
Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo, Vienna, Washington and Wuhan.

Madame Tussauds Attractions typically target a broad visitor demographic, with a particular trend
towards 30 to 40 year olds, teens and young adults, as well as city centre tourists. The brand also


-----

typically targets discreet audiences, with particular wax figures proving very successful with particular
audiences.

_The Eye Brand_

As of December 31, 2022, we operated three observation attractions under the Eye brand: the
lastminute.com London Eye (“London Eye”), situated on the South Bank of the River Thames in central
London; the Sydney Tower Eye in downtown Sydney overlooking Darling Harbour and the Sydney
Opera House with views to the outlying suburbs and the Blackpool Tower Eye in the UK. In 2022, we
partnered with the Kensa Group with the aim to promote the sustainability of the London Eye and
reduce its environmental footprint.

Revenue from our Eye brand is generated through ticket sales, as well as sales of a range of value added
products such as private capsules to rent for an event or occasion, river cruises, food and beverages,
photographic souvenirs and themed merchandise.

The London Eye, conceived and designed by Marks Barfield Architects, opened to customers in March
2000 as part of London’s millennium building programme. The London Eye consists of a rotating wheel
with 32 clear glass pods, each capable of holding approximately 25 passengers, that turns at a rate of
approximately two rotations per hour. The pods give 360° panoramic views over London and rise over
135 metres above the ground, making it the World’s tallest cantilevered observation wheel. The London
Eye has become one of the iconic sights of London and has won over 40 awards for national and
international tourism and engineering achievement.

_LEGO/LEGOLAND Discovery Centre_

The LEGO and LEGOLAND Discovery Centre Attractions have a focus on “playful learning,” offering
a combination of indoor LEGO based rides and activities centred around their main “Miniland”
attraction, which contains reduced scale models built from LEGO bricks featuring landmarks from the
host country and surrounding countries, typically situated in the middle of the park. These experiences
may include a factory tour, “Build and Test” and 4D cinema and LEGO themed play areas such LEGO
NINJAGO soft play, with the overall visitor experience focused on hands on LEGO play.

Our first LEGOLAND Discovery Centre was launched in Berlin in March 2007. LEGOLAND
Discovery Centres are typically located in shopping malls and city centres and offer fun and playful
learning experiences for children between the ages of two and twelve years. A typical visit to a
LEGOLAND Discovery Centre lasts approximately two hours. As of 1 April 2023, there were 28
LEGO/LEGOLAND Discovery Centres open in Arizona, Atlanta, Bay Area, Birmingham, Beijing,
Berlin, Boston, Brussels, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas/Fort Worth, Hong Kong, Istanbul, Kansas City,
Manchester, Melbourne, Michigan, New Jersey, Oberhausen, Osaka, Philadelphia, San Antonio,
Scheveningen, Shanghai, Shenyang, Tokyo, Toronto and Westchester. In 2022, we opened a LEGO
Discovery Centre in Brussels, Belgium, which is the first of our “next generation” version of the brand.
We are planning to open a LEGO Discovery Center in Washington, D.C., in June 2023. LEGO
Discovery Centre Brussels features a new, state of the art LEGO “Spaceship Build & Scan” digital
experience, where children and families can build space rocket out of LEGO bricks and digitally scan,
launch and fly their creations in the LEGO Space solar system.

_The Dungeons_

The Dungeons are themed indoor Attractions with strong historical and irreverent horror references,
rides and live entertainment typically targeting teenagers, young adults and city centre tourists. As of 1
April 2023, there were ten Dungeons in four countries, located in Amsterdam, Berlin, Blackpool,
Edinburgh, Hamburg, London, Shanghai, York and as Second Gate attractions at our Warwick Castle
and Alton Towers Resort Theme Parks. The London Dungeon is the best known in the portfolio and
has been in operation since 1976. We relocated the London Dungeon in 2013 to the South Bank,


-----

adjacent to the London SEA LIFE and the London Eye Attractions, which we believe enables the
London Dungeon to benefit from increased cluster sales and synergistic operational savings.

_Peppa Pig Attractions_

In 2018, we opened our first “Peppa Pig World of Play” Attraction in Shanghai, having established
multi territory exclusivity with Entertainment One. As of 1 April 2023, we operated five Peppa Pig
World of Play sites including the Shanghai site, and additional sites located in Dallas, Michigan,
Chicago and Leidschendam. In 2022 we also opened our _Peppa Pig Theme Park Florida, our first_
standalone theme park based on the Peppa Pig brand, serving as a Second Gate attraction adjacent to
our LEGOLAND Florida Resort. This concept of standalone theme park features multiple rides,
interactive attractions, themed play-scapes and shows, all based on instantly recognizable locations
from the globally popular brand. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we are developing a
second Peppa Pig theme park to be located in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, Texas, which is scheduled for
opening in 2024.

_Little BIG City_

In 2017, we opened a new Midway Attraction brand in Berlin called Little BIG City and in 2018,
launched a Little BIG City in Beijing. Little BIG City is our take on a model village with a unique
fusion of miniature models and modern technology to make the history of the city come alive.

_Other_

In 2015, we opened “DreamWorks Tours’ Shrek’s Adventure!,” an interactive experience based around
DreamWorks characters on the London South Bank site, close to the London Eye.

In 2018, we opened our first pilot “Bear Grylls Adventure” Attraction, having secured global exclusivity
on the “Bear Grylls Adventure” concept.

Since 2012, we also own and operate two Treetop Walk and zip-line tour experiences in Victoria (Otway
_Fly) and New South Wales (Illawarra Fly), Australia._

In addition, we acquired two WILD LIFE Australian animal adventure Attractions as part of the Sydney
Attractions Group acquisition. We have subsequently exited from one of these Attractions, WILD LIFE
Hamilton Island, and still operate the WILD LIFE Sydney Zoo as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum.

In 2022, we opened “Peter Rabbit: Explore and Play” in Blackpool, enhancing our cluster of local
Midway Attractions currently featuring Madame Tussauds Blackpool, The Blackpool Tower and SEA
LIFE Blackpool.

**_LEGOLAND Resorts and Parks_**

The LEGOLAND Parks operating group consists of ten interactive LEGO themed parks across eight
countries and three continents. Our LEGOLAND Parks are typically targeted at families with children
aged two to twelve years. The LEGOLAND Parks benefit from a very high brand awareness level as a
result of their affiliation with the LEGO brand, one of the world’s leading toys’ brands. We use the
LEGO and LEGOLAND trademarks to develop and operate the parks pursuant to the LCA with the
KIRKBI Group. The KIRKBI Group is, as of 31 December 2022, a 75 per cent. shareholder of the
LEGO Group, has 100 per cent. ownership of the LEGO and LEGOLAND trademarks and through
KIRKBI, a 47.49 per cent. shareholder in JVco.

We have three business models for our LEGOLAND Parks:


-----

- Our “owned and operated” model is used in proven locations and geographies. We own and
operate our LEGOLAND Parks in Florida, California, New York state, the United Kingdom,
Germany, Denmark and South Korea.;

- Our “leased and operated” model is used in markets that are newer to us or in connection with
projects that are part of a broader development. Under this model, we have full operational
control and ownership of rides and LEGO theming and lease the land and infrastructure form a
partner. See “—Material Contracts.” We “lease and operate” our LEGOLAND Park in
Nagoya, Japan; and

- Our “manage and operate” model entails cooperating with a local partner, by merging their
local capabilities and expertise with our strengths. Typically, under our “manage and operate”
model, funding for the capital investment is provided by a third party, while we operate the
park under a management contract. Our LEGOLAND Parks in Malaysia and Dubai are operated
pursuant to this model. We also expect that LEGOLAND Sichuan, LEGOLAND Shenzhen and
LEGOLAND Shanghai will be managed under a similar operating structure once opened. See
“—Material Contracts.”

The LEGOLAND Parks received an aggregate of 16.2 million visitors in the 2022 financial year.
Revenue from the LEGOLAND Parks operating group increased by 135 per cent. from the 2020
financial year to the 2021 financial year, and by 68 per cent. from the 2021 financial year to the 2022
financial year, underscoring a significant recovery from the impact of COVID-19 in 2020. The original
LEGOLAND Park was opened in Billund in 1968 to showcase the LEGO brand and provide an
enhanced experience to visitors to the LEGO factory. Based on the success of the concept, the
LEGOLAND brand was rolled out by the KIRKBI Group into the United Kingdom in 1996, the United
States in 1999 and Germany in 2002. We opened a fifth LEGOLAND Park just outside Orlando,
Florida, in 2011, a sixth LEGOLAND Park in Malaysia, close to the border with Singapore, in 2012,
our seventh in Dubai in 2016, our eight in Nagoya, Japan in 2017, our ninth in New York in 2021 and
our tenth in South Korea in 2022. In addition, we are also developing three LEGOLAND Parks in China
in cooperation with local partners. Each of LEGOLAND Sichuan resort, LEGOLAND Shanghai resort
and LEGOLAND Shenzhen resort is expected to open during or after 2025. All three will be operated
under our management contract model.

The following table sets out certain details of each of our LEGOLAND Parks:

**Name** **Date Opened** **Country** **Other Amenities**

LEGOLAND Billund ............................ 1968 Denmark Two hotels and holiday Village

LEGOLAND Windsor[(1)] ....................... 1996 UK Two hotels

LEGOLAND California ........................ Two hotels, SEA LIFE Centre,

1999 U.S. LEGOLAND Waterpark

LEGOLAND Deutschland .................... Hotel, Holiday village (including hotel

________________________________________

(1) LEGOLAND Windsor benefits from two hotels. One hotel is owned by us and the other is “leased and operated.”

(2) LEGOLAND Malaysia is operated under a management contract and we hold a 20 per cent. equity interest in the project
company that owns the park assets. We have no equity interest in the hotel.

(3) LEGOLAND Dubai is operated under a management contract. While we do not hold any equity interest in the company owning
the park, we hold a 40 per cent. equity interest in the company that owns and operates the hotel.

(4) LEGOLAND Japan is “leased and operated.”


-----

All LEGOLAND Parks are based on a similar concept that is adapted to local visitor tastes. Each park
comprises a “Miniland,” reduced scale models built from LEGO bricks, featuring landmarks from the
host country and surrounding countries, typically situated in the middle of the park, with four to six
themed clusters containing interactive rides, shows and food and beverage facilities surrounding the
Miniland.

LEGOLAND Parks generate revenue through both admission fees and commercial spend on priority
ride access passes, merchandise, food and beverages, souvenir photography, participation games and
parking fees. Each park’s LEGOLAND branding permits a high level of cross promotion with LEGO
merchandise and results in correspondingly strong commercial spend with a relatively high revenue per
capita of £47.29 in the 2022 financial year, £44.16 in the 2021 financial year and £34.64 in the 2020
financial year. In the 2022 financial year, we generated £924 million of revenue at our LEGOLAND
Parks. In the 2022 financial year, 72 per cent. of our revenue at our LEGOLAND Parks comprised
visitor revenue and 23 per cent. comprised accommodation revenue.

The LEGOLAND Parks have been able to capitalise on the growth of the LEGO brand association by
using well known LEGO characters and brands, such as LEGO NINJAGO and LEGO Mythica.

The LEGOLAND Parks typically target families with children aged two to twelve years and the
majority of visitors to our LEGOLAND Parks fall within this demographic. This demographic does not
demand expensive, large format “thrill” rides and LEGOLAND Parks enjoy high repeat visitor
numbers.

_LEGOLAND California_

LEGOLAND California is our most visited LEGOLAND Park and is located on a 128 acre site in San
Diego County, the United States, close to the Pacific Ocean. Since it opened in 1999, we have added
substantial capacity to the park through new rides and Attractions and food, beverage and retail outlets.
The park has more than 60 rides, shows and other Attractions and a variety of shops and restaurants.
Signature features include “LEGO NINJAGO The Ride,” “LEGO City Deep Sea Adventure,” “Lost
_Kingdom Adventure” and “LEGO TECHNIC Coaster.” LEGOLAND California operates year round,_
with the park closed on select Tuesdays and Wednesdays in the off peak season. Combined with
Southern California’s moderate climate, this provides the park with a smoother seasonality profile,
compared to most of the other Theme Parks. In August 2008, we opened a SEA LIFE Centre as a second
gate at LEGOLAND California. We have since added the themed LEGOLAND Waterpark, opened in
2010 and expanded in 2014, which can be accessed by park visitors for an additional fee. In addition,
in May 2022, we opened “LEGO Ferrari Build and Race.” Featuring a life-size LEGO Ferrari F40
model, this interactive attraction aims offer visitors a full “in the driver’s seat” experience, by allowing
to build, test and race LEGO Ferrari models. We also developed a 250 room on site themed hotel,
opened in 2013. We opened a 250 room LEGOLAND California Castle Hotel in 2018.

_LEGOLAND Billund_

LEGOLAND Billund opened in 1968. It began as a nine acre Miniland which attracted 625,000 visitors
in the first year and has since grown to a park of approximately 38 acres with an additional 15 acres
owned and 20 acres rented for car parking and support services. LEGOLAND Billund is open from
March to October and consists of more than 50 rides, shows and other Attractions and a variety of shops
and restaurants. Attractions include “Atlantis by SEA LIFE,” “NINJAGO Land,” “Polar X plorer”,
“Flying Eagle” rides and “LEGO Movie World,” LEGOLAND Billund has a 142 room Castle Hotel as
well as a 223 room hotel, with a conference centre facility and a holiday village, which includes 110
lodges, 48 family rooms, 30 “barrels” and a campsite, which we lease and manage. Also located at the
Billund resort is a chalet style holiday village with 916 lodges and a Waterpark, each of which is
managed by Lalandia.


-----

LEGOLAND Billund is located in the middle of Jutland on the mainland of Denmark and benefits from
good transport links being close to Billund International Airport. In the 2022 financial year, we estimate
that domestic Danish visitors accounted for 46 per cent. of the total visitors, with the remainder visiting
mostly from Germany, Norway, Sweden and The Netherlands.

_LEGOLAND Windsor_

LEGOLAND Windsor opened in 1996 as the first LEGOLAND Park outside Denmark and, according
to the TEA/AECOM Theme Index and Museum Index: The Global Attractions Attendance Report
(2021), it was the second most visited theme park in the UK by number of visitors in 2021. The park is
located close to Windsor, United Kingdom and is open from February to late December. Signature rides
and Attractions include the “Miniland”, “LEGO City Driving School” and the “Dragon coaster.”
LEGOLAND Windsor opened the “World of LEGO MYTHICA” in 2021, featuring the UK’s first flying
theatre ride – Flight of the Sky Lion. In the summer of 2023 we plan to open two new attractions at
LEGOLAND Windsor, including the “Ferrari Build and Race” attraction, and LEGOLAND Windsor’s
first Second Gate experience: “LEGOLAND Adventure Golf” – the UK’s first LEGO themed indoor
golf attraction. In March 2012, we opened a 150 room LEGO themed hotel and conference centre to
enhance the resort’s appeal to the short break market. A second hotel, the LEGOLAND Windsor Castle
Hotel was opened in July 2017, which includes 61 fully themed premium rooms.

We are also planning to open the UK’s first LEGO themed holiday village at LEGOLAND Windsor
Resort in 2024. The LEGOLAND Woodland Village will feature 150 lodges, an on-site restaurant, and
a family entertainment hub on a 10-acre site. The LEGOLAND Woodland Village’s operational energy
will be fossil fuel free once complete, thereby representing the first operationally carbon-neutral
accommodation across our global Theme Park operations. We have partnered with The Carbon Trust
on developing a comprehensive carbon reduction plan, to guide our adoption of low carbon
technologies, energy efficiency and high-quality offsets.

LEGOLAND Windsor is located within a one hour drive from London and benefits from good transport
links.

_LEGOLAND Deutschland_

LEGOLAND Deutschland opened in May 2002 in Günzburg, Bavaria, Germany. LEGOLAND
Deutschland has more than 60 rides, shows and Attractions in ten themed areas, and a variety of shops
and restaurants, and is open from the end of March to early November. Signature rides and Attractions
include the “Maximus” family coaster (which is part of our new MYTHICA theme world), “The Great
_LEGO Race,” a LEGO NINJAGO 4 D ride, “Temple X pedition,” “Jungle X pedition” and_
“LEGOLAND Atlantis by SEA LIFE” and Miniland, nationally and internationally recognised buildings
being rebuilt out of more than 25 million LEGO bricks on a 1:20 scale. In addition, in 2023 we opened
a LEGO MYTHICA themed world.

We believe that approximately 70 per cent. of visitors in the 2022 financial year were German. The park
is serviced by good transport links and is within 1.5 hours’ drive from both Munich and Stuttgart.

In 2008, we opened our first holiday village at LEGOLAND Deutschland, initially with 48 chalets, a
refectory, a playground and a 177 space campsite. Since then, there have been further phases of
development, including the addition of a Knight’s Castle, a Dragon Castle, a 142 room “Pirate Island”
themed hotel and a King’s Castle extension, additional chalets and barrel style accommodations. In
2022, we added a new Ninjago Themed Accommodation with 72 rooms. At the end of the 2022 financial
year, the park had 60 chalets (120 rooms), 136 rooms in the castle hotels, 142 rooms in the “Pirate
_Island” hotel, 72 rooms in the NINJAGO accommodation, 39 barrels and a 165 space campsite._


-----

_LEGOLAND Florida_

LEGOLAND Florida was built on the site of the former Cypress Gardens theme park and opened to the
public in October 2011. It exceeded its business case visitor numbers in the first full year of operation.
Due to the site’s history and pre-existing infrastructure, we believe the development cost was
substantially below the standard cost to develop a comparable theme park.

The park is located on a 150-acre site on the shores of Lake Eloise in the city of Winter Haven, Florida
and is an approximately 45 minute drive from Orlando and downtown Tampa. The park has more than
50 rides, shows and Attractions, restaurants, shopping, and a botanical garden, and is based on thirteen
themed zones, including Miniland USA, the Imagination Zone, LEGO City, “Heartlake City” and
LEGO NINJAGO World. LEGOLAND Florida operates all year round, with the park closed on some
Tuesdays and Wednesdays during off peak periods. LEGOLAND Florida also includes a themed
LEGOLAND Waterpark which can be accessed by park visitors for an additional fee and a 152 room
LEGOLAND Florida hotel along with a 166-room holiday village. In 2020, we opened a 150 room
Pirate Island Hotel in LEGOLAND Florida, which represents first LEGO Pirate hotel in North America.

In 2023, we achieved Autism Centre accreditation for LEGOLAND Florida, and are planning to achieve
the same accreditation for other LEGOLAND sites in 2023.

_LEGOLAND Malaysia_

LEGOLAND Malaysia was developed on a 76-acre greenfield site in southern Malaysia close to the
Singapore border and the park was opened in 2012. In 2013, a 249 room LEGOLAND Hotel (which
has since been expanded to 263 rooms) and a LEGOLAND Waterpark were built. We do not own the
Park but instead operate it pursuant to a development and management agreement with Malaysian
partners, with funds provided by the Malaysian government under which we were paid an initial
development fee and receive an annual operating fee based on the revenue and EBITDA of the Resort
and an annual management fee based on yearly inflationary consumer price index increases. We hold
20 per cent. of the issued share capital of the project company that owns the Park. The park has more
than 70 interactive rides, slides, shows and Attractions. The Attractions are grouped into themed areas
of which the centrepiece is MINILAND, where Asian landmarks have been recreated using more than
30 million LEGO bricks. LEGOLAND Waterpark has over 20 slides and water-based Attractions.
LEGOLAND Malaysia operates year-round. In 2019, we opened a SEA LIFE centre as a second gate
Attraction, close to the Park. The SEA LIFE Centre is operated as part of the Midway Attractions
operating group. We manage the park and the hotel pursuant to management contracts. See “—Material
_Contracts.”_

_LEGOLAND Dubai_

LEGOLAND Dubai opened in 2016. The park is located between Dubai and Abu Dhabi on Sheikh
Zayed Road as an integral component of Dubai Parks and Resorts. We do not own the park but instead
operate it pursuant to a management agreement with our local partner, DXB Entertainment LLC. The
park has more than 40 interactive rides, shows and Attractions, grouped into six themed areas, and
includes a 17 metre tall Burj Khalifa LEGO model. Adjacent to LEGOLAND Dubai is LEGOLAND
Waterpark with over 20 slides and Attractions. LEGOLAND Dubai and LEGOLAND Waterpark
operate all year round. Since 2022, we also operate a hotel at LEGOLAND Dubai pursuant to a
management contract and in which we hold a 40 per cent. equity interest.

_LEGOLAND Japan_

LEGOLAND Japan opened in 2017. The park is located at Kinjofuto, Minato ku, Nagoya, Japan. We
developed the park under our “leased and operated” model, whereby we a local operating company
leases the site and park infrastructure from a development partner. Under this model, we invested
approximately one third of the total park cost, with the balance of the assets, primarily park
infrastructure assets, funded and owned by one of KIRKBI’s subsidiaries. We lease the park and


-----

associated assets on arm’s length commercial terms, paying a turnover based rent with an annual floor
on a 50 year lease. The park has more than 40 interactive rides, shows and Attractions, grouped into
eight themed areas such as Miniland, Bricktopia and Knights’ Kingdom, with approximately 10,000
LEGO models and 17 million LEGO bricks. In 2018, we opened a SEA LIFE Centre, a second gate
Attraction, and a 252 room LEGOLAND Hotel at the site and in 2019, we opened a NINJAGO land
attraction.

_LEGOLAND New York_

LEGOLAND New York, which opened in 2021, is located on a 550-acre site in Orange County, United
States, approximately 60 miles northwest of New York City. It is open seasonally, typically from early
April through December, with seven-day operations during peak season from Memorial Day to Labor
Day. The park has more than 50 rides and other Attractions and a variety of shops and restaurants spread
over seven themed lands. Signature features include “LEGO Factory Adventure Ride,” “LEGO
_NINJAGO,” “Dragon Coaster,” and “MINILAND LEGOLAND.” LEGOLAND New York also features_
a 250-room themed LEGOLAND hotel, representing the only LEGO themed hotel in the Northeast U.S.
Rooms at the hotel are featured in four themes: LEGO Pirates, Kingdom, LEGO Friends, and LEGO
NINJAGO. We opened our LEGOLAND hotel the same time as the theme park and have since recorded
bookings at or near 95% capacity throughout our 2021 and 2022 theme park seasons. We plan to open
a water playground in 2023.

_LEGOLAND Korea_

LEGOLAND Korea opened in 2022. The park is located on Jung-do island, which is within 2 hours
drive from the Great Seoul Metropolitan area. LEGOLAND Korea is the first LEGOLAND park built
on an island.

the hotel are featured in four themes: LEGO Pirates, Kingdom, LEGO Friends, and LEGO NINJAGO.

**_Resort Theme Parks_**

The Resort Theme Parks operating group consists of six national Resort Theme Parks each of which
has at least one on site accommodation offering. They typically target large populations in European
markets, generally catering to the domestic market where each site is located, but with an increasing
international audience at certain of the parks, particularly Gardaland Resort. All six Resort Theme Parks
have associated accommodation offerings, including hotels, holiday villages, lodge accommodation or
“glamping” which enable those parks to attract a wider range of visitors who live further from the parks.
Resort Theme Parks generate revenue through both admission fees and commercial spend on sales of
priority ride access passes, food and beverages, merchandise and souvenir photographs, participation
games and car parking. For the 2022 financial year, 80 per cent. of our revenue at our Resort Theme
Parks comprised visitor revenue and 18 per cent. comprised accommodation revenue. In the 2022
financial year, we generated £361 million of visitor revenue at our Resort Theme Parks. Multi day stays
by visitors at attached and off site hotels increase this commercial spend and targeting such stays has
been a growing part of the operating group’s strategy. Certain Resort Theme Parks have “second gates,”
a concept that management plans to continue developing at other Resort Theme Parks.

In addition, since the outbreak of COVID-19, we deployed several measures to refine our operating
model, aimed at reducing our fixed cost base and create a lower and more flexible cost base able to


-----

better react to material changes in demand. For example, we transitioned our Resort Theme Parks
located in the UK as well as our LEGOLAND California Resort and LEGOLAND Florida Resort to
having food and beverage services provided by our partner Aramark. For these Attractions, we no longer
record the value of revenue received from customers for such services, but instead report revenues on
a ‘net’ basis under the terms of our fee arrangement with Aramark, which comprises both fixed and
variable elements.

The Resort Theme Parks received an aggregate of 11.5 million visitors in the 2022 financial year.
Revenue per capita in 2022 was £31.40. Revenue for the Resort Theme Parks increased by 19.4 per
cent. between the 2021 financial year and the 2022 financial year, due in part to strong revenues per
guest and accommodation room rates reflecting robust consumer demand.

The following table sets out the location, target demographic and facilities of each of our Resort Theme
Parks:

**Name** **Date Opened** **Country** **Key Target Demographic** **Other Amenities**

Each Resort Theme Park offers a range of rides and activities, attracting stays of between one and three
days, with multi day stays encouraged by unique “resort style” hotel and holiday village accommodation
on site and partner hotels off site. The ability to plan multi day stays increases the pool of potential
visitors, as visitors are generally more likely to drive further distances for a multi-day visit compared
to a typical single day visit due to time constraints. The target visitor demographic ranges from families
with young children to teenagers and young adults to adults and families.

_Alton Towers Resort_

Alton Towers Resort was the United Kingdom’s most visited theme park in 2021 according to the
TEA/AECOM Report for 2021. The attraction is close to the Peak District National Park, Birmingham

_Warwick Castle_

Warwick Castle is a Grade I listed building and a scheduled ancient monument, whose grounds are a
Grade I registered park comprising 104 acres, designed by the renowned landscape gardener Capability
Brown, which are open all year round. The primary attraction is the castle itself, with a focus on
“historical escapism and fun learning,” interactive family activities and themed entertainment such as

walks which connect the castle with the River Avon.

There are three restaurants on the site with a combined seating capacity of around 250 people. Warwick
Castle also hosts private events including corporate hospitality functions, and up to 2,000 people can

**Material Contracts**

**_LCA_**

We license the LEGOLAND and LEGO trademarks pursuant to a licencing and co-operation agreement
dated 24 August 2005 (as subsequently amended and restated on 11 March 2011) with KIRKBI A/S.
See “—Intellectual Property.”

**_LEGOLAND Malaysia_**

We operate LEGOLAND Malaysia pursuant to a development and management agreement with
Malaysian partners with funds provided by the Malaysian government. Under the agreement, we were
paid an initial development fee and receive an annual operating fee and other fees based on the revenue
and EBITDA of the LEGOLAND Malaysia. We were required to contribute half of our initial
development fee to the capital of the project company (“IDR”) that owns the park assets and were
required to contribute future revenue and EBITDA related fees to the capital of IDR until we held 20
per cent. of the issued share capital of that company. That level has now been reached and thus we are
no longer required to contribute management fees to IDR. The Malaysian government has invested in
the development of LEGOLAND Malaysia. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party
_Transactions.” We also signed a development and management agreement to operate a SEA LIFE_
aquarium on land owned by LEGOLAND Malaysia, which was opened in 2019.

**_LEGOLAND Dubai_**

We operate LEGOLAND Dubai pursuant to a development and management contract. Our local partner
owns the assets and we operate the park. Under the contract, we were paid an initial development fee
and receive an annual operating fee and other fees based on the revenue and EBITDA of LEGOLAND
Dubai. A themed hotel at the resort opened in January 2022, developed in partnership with the park’s
owners. We do not have an equity interest in LEGOLAND Dubai but hold a 40% equity interest in the
joint venture which owns the hotel.

**_LEGOLAND Japan_**

LEGOLAND Japan, which opened in 2017, was funded through a “leased and operated” model, in
which we invested approximately one third of the value of the park, with the balance of the assets,
primarily park infrastructure assets, funded and owned by one of KIRKBI’s subsidiaries, through a


-----

combination of equity, and external debt provided by Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, of which
the debt has since been repaid. We lease the park and associated assets on arm’s length commercial
terms, whereby our obligations come in the form of fixed rental payments of JPY 879,000,000 per year
in addition to turnover rent and ongoing repair obligations on a 50 year lease. See “Certain
_Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”_

**_LEGOLAND Sichuan_**

We entered into an agreement with a local partner to develop a LEGOLAND resort in the city of
Meishan, located approximately 60 kilometres south of Chengdu city centre in the Sichuan Province in
Western China. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the LEGOLAND Sichuan resort is under
development, and is expected to open during or after 2025. Under the terms of the agreement relating
to the development of LEGOLAND Sichuan, our local partner has fully funded the construction of
LEGOLAND Sichuan, as well as the required infrastructure and adjacent commercial developments,
and will be responsible for maintenance capital expenditure once the park is operational. We have been
appointed to lead on the resort development and intend to operate it under a management contract
arrangement which includes a combination of fixed and variable returns. Our partner has currently
paused this development as the shareholding in the partner consortium is subject to finalization in 2023.
As part of this process the structure for development is likely to change with the partner taking on
responsibility for the general facility construction of the resort. As of date, no new contract for this has
been agreed.

**_LEGOLAND Shanghai_**

We entered into an agreement with a local state owned enterprise and our shareholder KIRKBI together
with a local minority investor to develop a LEGOLAND resort in the Jinshan District in south west
Shanghai, China. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the LEGOLAND Shanghai resort is
under development, and is expected to open during or after 2025. Under the terms of the agreement
with our partners for this project, parties have formed a joint venture company (including Merlin as a
minority shareholder) and contributed funding to the construction and development of LEGOLAND
Shanghai (pro rata to each joint venture partner’s share). We have been appointed to lead the
development of the LEGOLAND Shanghai Resort. Once opened, we will operate LEGOLAND
Shanghai under a management contract arrangement, which includes a combination of fixed and
variable returns. Capital expenditure in respect of the project is incurred by the joint venture.

**_LEGOLAND Shenzhen_**

We entered into an agreement with a local partner to jointly develop a LEGOLAND resort in the
Shenzhen province, China. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the LEGOLAND Shenzhen
resort is under development, and is expected to open during or after 2025. Pursuant the terms of the
agreement with our local partner, our local partner has funded the construction of LEGOLAND
Sichuan, as well as the required infrastructure and adjacent commercial developments, and will be
responsible for maintenance capital expenditure once the park is operational. We have been appointed
to lead on the resort development and will operate it under a management contract arrangement which
includes a combination of fixed and variable returns.

**_London Eye_**

We hold the property on which the London Eye Attraction is located pursuant to three lease agreements
and a River Works licence agreement. The main ticket hall is in the sub-basement, basement and ground
floor of the County Hall on London’s South Bank and held pursuant to a lease dated 30 December 2003,
valid until 31 December 2051. The main paved landscape and queue line area adjoining Jubilee
Gardens, next to the London Eye, is held under a lease dated 30 December 2003, valid until 31
December 2101. We also hold a third lease for further land at Jubilee Gardens, dated 8 February 2006,
which is valid for until 31 December 2030. The latter two leases include part of the London Eye
structure in addition to the aforementioned landscape and queue line area.


-----

The London Eye is situated in the Borough of Lambeth and was granted planning by Lambeth Council
in November 2003 on a conditional 25-year basis. We are in the process of discharging this condition
to secure the permanent retention of the London Eye in this location. Once the condition has been
discharged, we plan to agree long-term lease renewals with the London Eye landowners, prioritising
the 2031 lease expiry initially. We believe the landowners all share our desire to drive footfall to the
South Bank and the London Eye is a crucial part of this.

Further, part of the London Eye site is operated pursuant to a River Works licence granted to us by the
Port of London Authority, dated 10 August 1999. The licence does not have a contractual expiry date
but can be revoked by the Port of London Authority on three months’ notice, subject to the right of
appeal to the UK Government. Circumstances for cancellation include an un remedied breach of the
licence, the insolvency of the licensee or if the Port of London Authority exercises its statutory powers
for navigational or river regime reasons. We have recently agreed a deed of variation to fix the
mechanism for the annual fee paid to the Port of London Authority through to 2039.

**_Peppa Pig World of Play and Peppa Pig Theme Parks_**

We operate our Peppa Pig World of Play Attractions and our standalone Peppa Pig theme park pursuant
to an exclusive multi territory licensing agreement with Entertainment One (“eOne”) (which Hasbro
acquired in 2019), owner of the Peppa Pig brand, which allows us to develop a range of attractions
based on the Peppa Pig brand. Pursuant to this agreement, we opened the first Peppa Pig World of Play
Attraction in Shanghai at the end of 2018 and subsequently rolled out four additional Peppa Pig World
of Play Attractions in Dallas and Michigan in 2019, in Chicago in 2021 and in the Netherlands in 2022.
In addition, we opened one standalone theme park based on the Peppa Pig brand as a Second Gate to
our LEGOLAND Florida park in early 2022. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we are
developing a second Peppa Pig theme park to be located in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, Texas, which is
scheduled for opening in 2024.

Peppa Pig World of Play is an indoor Attraction that gives pre-school children an opportunity to step
into the exciting world of Peppa Pig in an immersive play environment packed full of family inclusive
activities. The license under the agreement confers exclusivity, with the exception of the UK and China.
In China, we have non-exclusive rights and have the right to be notified in advance of any third-party
deals. In China, we receive local exclusivity for all Peppa Pig World of Play Attractions once opened,
with the distance and exclusivity varying depending on the type of Attraction.

**_Sale and Leaseback Transactions_**

We lease Alton Towers Resort, Heide Park Resort, THORPE PARK Resort and Warwick Castle from
LXi REIT (which are currently valid until 2077), and we have a right to renew each lease for a 35-year
period on materially similar terms, subject to an adjustment to market rates at that time. We lease
Madame Tussauds, London from Fubon MTL Property (Jersey) Ltd.

In May 2012, we entered into a sale and leaseback arrangement with Richie Properties in respect of the
LEGOLAND Windsor Hotel. The lease for LEGOLAND Windsor Hotel was subsequently transferred
to Aberdeen Standard Investments.

We do not have any other sale and leaseback arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a
current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses,
operating results, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Sale and Leaseback Transactions.”

**_Intellectual Property_**

Our principal intellectual property rights are the various trademarks comprising the Key Brands. With
the exception of the LEGOLAND and LEGO trademarks, which are licensed to us under an agreement
with KIRKBI A/S, we have pursued a programme of registering trademarks relevant to the Key Brands


-----

in those territories in which we operate under the Key Brands, including the United Kingdom, Member
States of the EEA, the United States and various countries in the Asia Pacific region.

Pursuant to the LCA, we have an exclusive and worldwide right to use: (i) certain LEGOLAND
registered trademarks, including the word “LEGOLAND” and LEGOLAND associated logos; and (ii)
various LEGO related registered trademarks, until at least 2075 for the purpose of operating and
promoting the LEGOLAND Parks and LEGO/LEGOLAND Discovery Centres and for use in the
construction, operation and promotion of new LEGOLAND Parks and LEGO/LEGOLAND Discovery
Centres including in connection with hotels and other accommodation facilities and smaller
LEGOLAND Attractions such as merchandise.

We pay KIRKBI A/S a royalty, calculated as a percentage of gross qualifying revenue generated by the
operation of the LEGOLAND Parks and Attractions. The royalty rates are, in normal circumstances,
fixed but can (i) reduce if the LEGO Group’s worldwide turnover falls below specified levels and (ii)
increase, (a) in relation to any LEGOLAND Park whose qualifying revenue falls below a specified floor
(being a percentage of that LEGOLAND Park’s first year’s qualifying revenue) and (b) if, but only for
so long as, the number of LEGOLAND Parks that we operate falls below three. If an increase in royalty
is triggered by a fall in qualifying revenue at a particular LEGOLAND Park, this increase applies to the
qualifying revenue of the affected LEGOLAND Park only and continues only until the required revenue
is achieved again. The amount we currently pay is approximately a low single digit percentage of
revenue.

The LCA requires us to develop the LEGOLAND business and the extension of the term of the LCA
on an exclusive basis is subject to the development of a certain number of LEGOLAND Parks or
LEGOLAND Discovery Centres. Our opening of six LEGOLAND Parks (Florida, Dubai, Japan
Malaysia, New York and South Korea) and LEGO/LEGOLAND Discovery Centres since 2007, confer
worldwide exclusivity until at least the end of 2075. We also have a right of first refusal under the LCA
to open a new LEGOLAND Park in any country or U.S. state that becomes non-exclusive. Once the
new park opens, our exclusive rights under the LCA are restored for the country or U.S. state in question.
The LCA also includes certain operational requirements for the operation of the LEGOLAND
Attractions, confirming their family orientation, the requirement of a LEGO theme, a list of minimum
components for each attraction, requirements for any new rides or Attractions at any LEGOLAND
venue and a requirement to monitor customer satisfaction and maintain it at above pre-determined
levels, as well as to include a retail area to sell LEGO merchandise.

The LCA includes rights for each party to terminate the agreement in specified circumstances. For
example, if visitor satisfaction survey results fall below a specified level for a park, the relevant park
may lose its license, subject to a two year grace period, during which the park must to improve its
performance to avoid losing its license. Guest satisfaction levels are currently significantly above the
minimum levels required. The LCA also specifies that we may lose the right to operate the LEGOLAND
brands if we are acquired by a competitor of the LEGO Group or an “inappropriate” person.

We have implemented certain changes to the licensing arrangements for LEGOLAND Discovery
Centres. Amongst others, these changes include introducing a new global, exclusive perpetual license
agreement to use the LEGO trademark for the purpose of the LEGO Discovery Centres, which license
agreement will be subject to separate fixed term license agreements of 20 years individually agreed for
each LEGO Discovery Centre. Furthermore, we agreed in 2022 to a review of the current format of the
LEGOLAND Discovery Centres as they transition to LEGO Discovery Centres, as well as more
flexibility for the LEGO Group to operate education centres and events near the LEGOLAND Parks
and updates to the LEGO product supply arrangements.

We also leverage third-party intellectual property such as “The Ghostbusters Experience” at Madame
Tussauds, New York, BBC Worldwide’s “CBeebies” at Alton Towers Resort, and “Horrible Histories”
at Warwick Castle. We used third-party intellectual property as part of our joint development with
DreamWorks Animation at “DreamWorks Tours’ Shrek’s Adventure!” in London, which opened in


-----

2015. We have also secured global exclusivity on the “Bear Grylls Adventure” concept and rolled out
our pilot Attraction in 2018 in Birmingham, United Kingdom. In addition, we have established multi
territory exclusivity with Entertainment One (which Hasbro acquired in 2019) to roll out a variety of
location based Attractions based on the Peppa Pig intellectual property, with the first “Peppa Pig World
_of Play” Attraction having opened in China in late 2018 and two additional Peppa Pig World of Play_
Attractions having opened in Dallas and Michigan in 2019. Lastly, we have entered into a multi-territory
exclusivity agreement with Sony Pictures Entertainment, to develop and operate attractions, rides,
lands, retail outlets and themed hotel rooms based on the studio’s “Jumanji” film franchise. As part of
our partnership with Sony Pictures Entertainment, in 2022 and 2023, we opened the “JUMANJI — The
_Adventure” and “JUMANJI: The Labyrinth” rides at our Gardaland park in Italy, and in 2023 we have_
developed a “World of Jumanji” themed land at our Chessington Theme Park Resort. We also added
six new _Jumanji themed bedrooms to our Chessington Safari Hotel, while a_ _Jumanji themed_
rollercoaster is expected to open by the end of 2023.

**Industry Expertise and Commitment to Visitor Satisfaction**

**_Merlin Annual Passes and Merlin Pass Monthly Membership_**

We use a number of channels to sell and distribute tickets, many attracting discounts from the advertised
“lead” price, including a “Merlin Annual Pass”. Merlin Annual Passes can be purchased for a one-off
price and enable our customers to visit all Attractions within a particular country for one year for no
additional admission fee, subject to occasional restrictions, including certain ‘restricted days’. Merlin
Annual Passes are currently available in the United Kingdom, Germany, the United States and Australia.
We plan to launch Merlin Annual Passes in other jurisdictions where we own or operate multiple
Attractions. In the United Kingdom, we also allow customers to pay a monthly fee on a minimum twelve
month contract as part of a Merlin Pass Monthly Membership in order to enjoy entry to our Attractions
in the United Kingdom. Merlin Pass Monthly Memberships are offered at different price points to offer
customers varying levels of admission or amenities according to the price paid. We also offer monthly
membership schemes at our North American LEGOLAND Parks. We use the Merlin Annual Pass and
Merlin Monthly Membership to drive visitor loyalty and brand awareness, to provide us with revenue
visibility, to secure cash flows in advance and to increase levels of secondary spending at the
Attractions. In addition, certain Attractions have single attraction annual passes.

**_Merlin Magic Making_**

MMM is a specialist in-house site-search and business development, creative design, project
management and production group within Merlin. With the exception of new LEGOLAND Parks and
some maintenance projects, all projects with a cost of over £1 million is managed by MMM project
managers. In particular, MMM provides the following services:

- driving innovation across our group and creating high class, compelling propositions for our
Attractions;

- developing new concepts into commercially viable Attractions;

- producing compelling content such as LEGO models, wax figures and Attraction theming; and

- constructing new Attractions and investment projects, including new hotels and rides.

With respect to our ride based Attractions, MMM sources new rides from established third-party
manufacturers, generally buying proven rides which are in operation in other Attractions as opposed to
higher risk prototypes. In each case, MMM works with the established third-party manufacturer to add
content, theming and technology to give the ride its distinctiveness. In addition, MMM works in close
cooperation other teams having in-house ethical animal welfare expertise.

**_Continuing Commitment to Deliver the Highest Quality Experience for Customers_**

Our focus on guest experiences and visitor satisfaction is key to generating growth in visitor numbers
and extending the length of stay across all our Attractions. Visitor satisfaction is an important
determinant of repeat visits and customer loyalty and also forms part of our employee incentive
arrangements. We measure visitor satisfaction levels through daily monitoring processes, which assist
management in identifying opportunities to support pricing and to help direct capital investment to
improving or replacing our product offering. We have a target overall guest satisfaction level and a
target value for money level of over 90 per cent. at each of the Attractions, and most of our Attractions
consistently achieve scores above this target. Our overall average guest satisfaction across our group
was 94 per cent. in 2022, which was unchanged compared to 2021. Historically our guest satisfaction
was 93, 93, 93, 94, 94, 96, 95, 94, 94, 94 and 94 per cent. for the financial years 2012, 2013, 2014,
2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. We also target the propensity for our
guests to recommend our Attractions through social media. Our Group Guest Excellence Director is
tasked with ensuring that our quality of experience key performance indicators remain high across the
portfolio. We have implemented specific processes at each Attraction to measure guest satisfaction and
give performance feedback daily. Touch screen machines have been installed in all Attractions and
these provide instant feedback to the relevant Attraction and the Group Guest Excellence team. We
conduct regular mystery shopper visits to measure each attraction against key metrics and to gauge
guest satisfaction. We also carry out mystery shopper visits for guests with disabilities and use the same
format for our key competitors to maintain our standards. Every Merlin site also has a portal to monitor
and respond to online reviews to maintain our external reputation.

We regularly use league tables and “Net Promoter Scores” (measuring whether a guest would
recommend our Attractions) to encourage further improvement and we view complaints, where they
occur, as a real opportunity to exceed visitor expectations through effective resolution. Product
Excellence Managers at most Attractions are tasked (under the leadership of their respective Divisional
Directors or General Managers) with resolving the sources of visitor complaints.

In addition, our board members and members of our senior management undertake regular site visits to
ensure that our guest experience is in line with guest expectations. We also make use of the “Yext”
platform, to monitor online guest reviews and assist us in gathering information to be leveraged when
planning on how to improve our attractions. In particular, customer insight have assisted us in making
significant progress on guest accessibility at our Attractions.

**Employees**

Our average number of permanent employees for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 financial years was 8,449,
8,367 and 11,954, respectively. Our average number of total employees, which also include seasonal or
temporary employees, for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 financial years was 13,599, 17,610 and 20,561,
respectively. Our workforce increased to approximately 25,660 employees during the peak season in
the 2022 financial year.

**_Employee Engagement_**

Every summer we run our online employee survey, “Wizard Wants to Know,” to assess how engaged
our staff are. Our employee engagement score is one of Merlin’s Key Performance Indicators,
measuring whether our teams think we are a “great place to perform,” “a great place for customers”
and a “great place to work.” In 2022, our engagement score was 68 per cent. favourable.

**_Diversity and Inclusion_**

Gender equality, ethnic diversity and inclusion are a crucial part of our people strategy and we are
committed to offering an inclusive working environment where difference is valued and diverse groups
are fully and properly represented at all levels of our organisation. In 2022, we expanded our “Everyone
_Matters at Merlin” diversity and inclusion strategy that looks to celebrate and enhance further diversity_


-----

within the business. Our four regional task forces deliver regional plans to support our global diversity
and inclusion goals, as well as assisting in driving change to our teams and wider communities at site
level. We strive to ensure we have the best people for every role, regardless of gender, race, disability,
sexual orientation or any other factor. For example, in 2022 we sponsored the first Evenfields Black
Talent Awards in the UK, celebrating winners from across the country in multiple different sectors
ranging from marketing to finance and the public sector. Over the same period, we also partnered with
the University College Birmingham to offer career and placement opportunities to students and
graduates from diverse backgrounds who are enrolled in tourism, hospitality, events and business
courses. As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, 50% of our top 10 attractions by revenue are run
by women and we believe that according to our internal estimates, as at the date of this Offering
Memorandum, we employ people from 96 different countries.

**_Recruitment, training and development_**

We operate in a sector with high employee turnover and so it requires effort to maintain our existing
employee base. On top of this, as we grow each year, we need an ever greater variety of roles and skills
and offer an increasingly wide range of opportunities. As a result, we have been working closely with
our recruiters to give them the skills, knowledge and creativity they need to find and select candidates
who have the right skills and attitudes for long and successful careers with us. Technology plays a key
role in our hiring strategy and application process so we continue to put special emphasis on our social
media activities and how we present our internal employer brand and values to the outside world.

Our goal is to allow everyone to have the right skills to be the best at what they do and fulfil their
potential in their career with us. We provide a variety of training and development activities across all
parts of our business. These range from induction training and role specific learning (for example in
health and safety, and animal welfare), through management and leadership programs, and on to
executive leadership development. During COVID-19 we deployed an increasing share of online
content and self-led learning modules, thereby allowing our teams to continue to access learning
opportunities remotely. Moreover, through 2021 and 2022, as we recovered from the impacts of
COVID-19, we shifted to a blended mix of online learning and development. and in person programs
for leadership development and critical skills such as marketing, engineering and commercial training.

**_Compensation and Benefits_**

We look to pay fairly for the roles performed and seek to incentivise and reward our employees through
the payment of annual performance related bonuses which are paid when Attraction or Group profit
targets are achieved and where personal objectives are met. In addition, we maintain a management
incentive plan in place, which allows many employees to have a stake in the business and to benefit
from its future growth. We also maintain numerous benefits on a global level, including an employeededicated Merlin Magic Pass allowing access to our Attractions, a stay-for-less arrangement at our
Attractions hotels, an employee assistance program and other locally relevant discounts.

**Health, Safety and Security**

Our health, safety and security programmes are designed to deliver industry leading health, safety and
security (“HSS”) standards, a rigorous safety culture and a commitment to safety from management and
staff. In addition, we further enhanced our HSS protocols and standards as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic. We maintain the rigor of our HSS standards by, amongst other things:

- providing intensive training and instruction, with mandatory new starter training for all
employees;

- implementing maintenance systems and procedures, comprising daily, weekly, monthly and
annual maintenance programmes across our estate;

- maintaining construction standards across all our global construction projects;

- emphasising fire safety as a core priority;

- our adoption of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point system for food safety and
supplier approval programmes designed to ensure full traceability over food products;

- communication of our strategic HSS vision through, for example, the production and
distribution of “Protecting the Magic—a Guide to Health, Safety and Security” and the launch
of “Employee Safety and Contractor Safety Handbooks” in 2018;

- reinforcement of our safety culture and engagement of employees through events such as
“Merlin Safety Week” which resumed in 2022;

- adopting precautionary measures to control the security risks such as terrorism, including bag
and guest searches and enhancement of covert security through the use of CCTV; and

- responding to weather risks such as hurricanes and heatwaves.

The Committee in charge of HSS (the “HSS Committee”) assists the Board in ensuring that HSS risks
are managed effectively across our group by overseeing our policies and procedures for HSS,
monitoring our processes for identifying and managing risks and monitoring the skills, effectiveness
and levels of resource within our HSS teams. The MTC rate captures the rate of guest injuries requiring
external medical treatment relative to 10,000 guest visitations. The reduction in our MTC rate on a
rolling basis in 2022 to 0.01 (as compared to 0.02 in 2020 and 2021, respectively) is therefore a positive
outcome.

**_Performance Monitoring_**

HSS performance is monitored and regularly reviewed by each attraction, each operating group’s senior
leadership team and the HSS Committee. Each attraction undergoes three types of routine review, being
self-audits, independent internal audits and periodic external audits. Our HSS performance is assessed
according to “leading indicators,” (those activities such as inspections and audits we perform to manage
risk) and “lagging indicators” (incident frequencies like the number of medical treatment case rates, for
both guests and employees).

**_The LEGOLAND Germany Accident_**

In August 2022, two rollercoaster trains collided at our LEGOLAND Germany theme park, resulting in
34 passengers sustaining either minor or no injuries, with passengers sent to hospital for further
examinations being discharged later on the same day (the “LEGOLAND Germany Accident”). This
incident received media attention and was followed by a police investigation which has not yet
concluded and involved a number of complex, inter-related, factors. Following this incident, we have
issued a safety alert, mandating a number of technical and procedure enhancements.


-----

**_Other Developments and Initiatives_**

Following the Grenfell Tower fire in the United Kingdom in 2017, a review was undertaken into the
suitability of fire safety practices at our hotels. No significant issues were found, but a number of
opportunities for improvement have been implemented as a result. Proactive fire engineering surveys
of our hotels have helped ensure that we continue to uphold high physical and procedural controls at all
of our hotels.

**_Information Technology_**

The primary role of our IT systems is to ensure that the necessary applications and underpinning
infrastructure are available to support our business. We have a specific operating group (“Merlin
_Digital”) which is responsible for providing support to the Attractions and delivering IT related projects._
In order to provide a responsive service to our larger Attractions, Merlin Digital is supported locally by
on site staff. Key IT systems used at many of the Attractions have specialist support teams based in the
United Kingdom.

We have extensive IT systems which support a wide range of areas of our business, including marketing,
sales, admissions, maintenance and retail operations, as well as finance and human resources. Our IT
systems comprise a combination of centralised and decentralised technology, with the larger Attractions
having their own dedicated IT support resources.

**Corporate Social Responsibility**

As one of the leading entertainment companies in the world, we define our values not just by the
passionate way we do business but also the way we treat our people, our visitors, our suppliers, the
creatures in our charge and the communities and environment in which we operate. We are committed
to being a responsible corporate citizen and design our governance structures and operate our business
in this regard. Over and above this, we are committed to “being a force for good” and making a positive
impact on both the planet and people. We focus on making a difference through our two charities:
Merlin’s Magic Wand and the SEA LIFE Trust.

**_Sustainability and the Environment_**

Merlin manages resources responsibly. We recognise that our operations have an impact upon the
environment and that effective management of this impact is essential for sustainable business success.
We maintain a robust track record of seeking to reduce both our local and global impact on the
environment with clear, measurable actions. In particular, we are committed to regular monitoring,
auditing and review of our activities and identifying opportunities for sustainable environmental
improvement, in line with our strategic business goals and in order to minimise the potentially harmful
effects of such activity.

We also participate in the UK Streamline Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR), the UK Energy
Savings Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) and other applicable environmental regulations globally. In 2022,
we are setting a net zero target for our global scope 1 and 2 emissions, to be met by 2030.

We have budgets set aside to test and implement environmentally focused initiatives. We have
developed group wide sustainability management and carbon reduction plans and a number of water
and waste management initiatives that have been developed to encourage sites and build on examples
of best practice across our group.

Some examples of environmental initiatives in the 2022 financial year were:

- continuing to drive staff and guest awareness on environmental issues, by launching a
sustainability good practice guide and a video tailored for general managers and technical staff;


-----

- maintaining a “green capex fund” supporting projects throughout our Existing Estate focusing
on LED lighting optimisation, variable frequency drives and the optimisation of building
management and life support systems; and

- commencing cooperation with a partner to install electric vehicle chargers across our UK
resorts.

Some examples of environmental initiatives in the 2021 financial year were:

- being one of only two venues selected to host HRH The Duke of Cambridge, who we welcomed
on the London Eye, for the inaugural Earthshot Prize 2021 Awards Ceremony. This event was
broadcast globally and awarded prizes to contestants who delivered innovative solutions to the
planet’s environmental issues;

- continued promotion of our conservation efforts through our SEA LIFE brand, by educating
guests on the dangers of plastic pollution in oceans and by actively contributing to raising
awareness through our partner charity, the SEA LIFE Trust. Over the same period, we also
supported SEA LIFE Trust’s annual beach clean activities; and

- we reviewed our retail store footprint with the aim remove unnecessary packaging and plastic
across all of our merchandise.

**_Marine and Wildlife Conservation_**

We take responsibility for the animals in our care and understand the role we must play in the
conservation of endangered creatures and habitats around the world. To this end, we strive to work to
world-class welfare standards through our animal care network. We promote the protection of wildlife
across the globe by supporting projects and campaigns that make a real difference. In doing this, we
leverage our reputation for the ethical and responsible care, preservation and conservation of animals
and the marine environment.

We maintain a strong animal welfare and conservation framework. For example, we established the
SEA LIFE Trust (the “Trust”) in 2013, a registered charity dedicated to protecting our oceans and the
wildlife within them. The Trust operates marine wildlife sanctuaries, runs inspiring conservation
campaigns and funds projects and education programmes that champion plastic-free oceans, sustainable
fishing, effective marine protected areas, and an end to the over-exploitation of marine life. We engage
our staff across the SEA LIFE estate to support these activities, such as our beach clean events where
SEA LIFE teams go out into the local community to keep their local beaches free of litter and we engage
our staff and our guests to support the Trust’s campaigns. We also established the SEA LIFE TRUST
Beluga Whale Sanctuary, in cooperation with Whale and Dolphin Conservation, with the goal to protect
Beluga Whales, provide a more natural home, and advance knowledge through wildlife research.

Chessington World of Adventure Resort in the United Kingdom and WILD LIFE Sydney Zoo also help
support our long standing commitment to animal breeding or managed species programmes.

Moreover, we maintain an in-house network of zoologists, marine biologists, aquarists and industry
experts, forming our the Conservation, Welfare and Engagement (“CWE”) team. Our CWE team
partners with universities, research centres and community programmes on global conservation
projects, and inspires our guest to support our work for the benefit of the marine environment.

We also routinely conduct external zoo licence audits, and maintain an internal ethics committee that
partners with our CWE team to monitor the welfare of animals at our Attractions. We implement a
comprehensive range of policies, standards, procedures and guidelines and deploy preventative
maintenance programmes to ensure buildings, infrastructure and vegetation remain suitable for
displaying the animals in our care. In addition, all staff who interacts with animals as part of their duties
undergoes a rigorous training program.


-----

**_Social & Governance_**

We deliver a strong contribution to local economies through our employment and procurement
channels, while also supporting other enterprises and services by generating consistent flows of tourists
at our Attractions.

We are also committed to maintaining the highest standards of governance in our internal structures.
Our Board works to ensure that all procedures, policies and practices of our business continue to be
effective, also through the assistance of _ad hoc committees. For example, our Health, Safety and_
Security Committee assists the board in governing the safe management of HSS risks effectively and
proactively throughout our group. The Committee’s primary areas of focus are to oversee our policies
and procedures for ensuring the HHS of guests, employees, contractors and operating assets, to monitor
our processes for identifying and managing risks and to monitor the skills, effectiveness and levels of
resource within our health, safety and security teams.

_Merlin’s Magic Wand_

In addition, we established the Merlin’s Magic Wand Children’s Charity in the UK 2008 and the
Merlin’s Magic Wand Foundation in the US in 2012, to enable children who are facing challenges of
serious illness, disability or adversity to have a memorable experience at one of our Attractions around
the world. These trips are made possible by the provision of attraction tickets (which come directly from
us at no cost to the charities) and travel grants which are provided by Merlin’s Magic Wand’s
fundraising. Since the charities have begun, we have provided days out to over one million children and
their families, launched multiple “Merlins Magic Spaces” projects globally and taken the magic of
Merlin “on tour” to children in hospitals all over the world. In the 2022 financial year, the charity
delivered over 60,000 Magical Days Out tickets to children facing serious illnesses, disability and
adversity and to their families. As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, the charity has gifted over
40,000 days out in 2023. In circumstances that prevent children from having a day out due to the nature
of their illness or disability, the charity invests in its “Merlin’s Magic Spaces” projects, which are local
outreach projects within the localities of our Attractions. For example, in 2022 we completed a Merlin
Magic Spaces project at the Ronald McDonald House in Philadelphia, in partnership with the
LEGOLAND Discovery Center Philadelphia team.

_Accessibility_

We aim to provide experiences and environments that are accessible to all. We want to provide industry
leading facilities and experiences. The cornerstones of our approach are:

- _Guest Information—to provide clear, accurate, consistent and accessible information to enable_
visitors to make informed choices;

- _Accessible Environments—to make our environments as accessible as possible, continually_
improving our estate; and

- _Team Engagement—to ensure employees have the tools and training to deliver memorable_
experiences to accessibility challenged guests.

In 2022, we launched an internal intel group, tasked with bringing together our employees with lived
experiences of disability, to inform and guide changes we are implementing to our disability inclusion
policies.

In 2022, we achieved Autism Center accreditation for our LEGOLAND Florida and LEGOLAND
California parks. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, LEGOLAND Florida’s three onsite
hotels, as well as the Peppa Pig Theme Park located in close proximity thereto, are also Autism Center
accredited. We are planning to extend such accreditation to additional sites, and expect all our North
American LEGOLAND parks to become Autism Center certified within Q2 2023


-----

**Insurance**

We maintain global insurance policies for property damage, terrorism, public and product liability,
travel, marine cargo, construction, professional indemnity and directors and officers liabilities. We
maintain business interruption insurance for the London attractions and we maintain insurance policies
at a local level based on legislative requirements including employer’s liability, motor, pension fund
liability and engineering. We do not maintain any key person insurance cover.

We believe that our insurance coverage is in accordance with industry custom, including the terms of
and the coverage provided by such insurance. Our policies are subject to standard limitations and
therefore insurance may not necessarily cover all losses that we incur. We cannot provide any assurance
that we will not incur losses or suffer claims beyond the limits of, or outside the relevant coverage of,
our insurance policies.

**Legal Proceedings**

At any given time, we may be a party to litigation or be subject to non-litigated claims arising out of
the normal operations of our business. We do not expect any liability arising from any of these legal
proceedings to have a material impact on our results of operations, liquidity, capital resources or
financial position. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Market and Our Business—We are subject
_to risks from legal and arbitration proceedings.”_

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

**Ordinary Course of Business Relationships with Subsidiaries**

In the course of our ordinary business activities, we regularly enter into agreements with companies
within our group. These agreements mainly relate to intercompany loans and group recharges.

We believe that all transactions with subsidiaries are negotiated and executed on an arm’s length basis
and that the terms of these transactions are comparable to those currently contracted with unrelated
third-party suppliers and service providers.

**Transactions with Shareholders**

During the 2020 to 2022 financial years, we entered into transactions with a major shareholder, KIRKBI
Invest A/S, the LEGO Group, a related party of KIRKBI Invest A/S, and LLJ Investco K.K, a subsidiary
of KIRKBI. Transactions entered into, including the purchase and sale of goods, the payment of fees
and royalties, and trading balances outstanding at the relevant financial year end, are as follows:

We lease land, buildings and car parking spaces from KIRKBI Invest A/S. The term of this lease is 25
years, with 17 years remaining as of 31 December 2022. Our annual obligations consist of fixed rental

“Business—Material Contracts—Intellectual Property.”


-----

In connection with the development of LEGOLAND Japan, we entered into a 50 year lease with LLJ
Investco K.K. (a subsidiary of KIRKBI Invest A/S). There were 44 years remaining as of 31 December
2022. Our annual obligations consist of fixed rental payments, turnover rent and service charges
totalling £6 million in 2022 (compared to £6 million in 2021). The total undiscounted commitment
relating to fixed rental payments is £245 million over the remaining lease term.

We also lease land and buildings from Koldingvej 2 Billund A/S (which has a 25 per cent. shareholding
in the LEGO Group). The term of this lease is 29 years, with 19 years remaining as of 31 December
2022. Our annual obligations consist of fixed rental payments, turnover rent and service charges
totalling less than £1 million in 2022 (compared to less than £1 million in 2021). The total undiscounted
commitment is £8 million over the remaining lease term.

We have also entered into lease agreements with parties that are related parties of the Blackstone
Investment Funds, comprising Multi Corporation B.V. in relation to SEA LIFE and LEGOLAND
Discovery Centre Istanbul, Shopcore in relation to LEGOLAND Discovery Centre Chicago, and NEC
Group Ltd, relating to the Bear Grylls Adventure attraction and the LEGOLAND Discovery Centre,
both located in Birmingham. In aggregate, our annual obligations for these agreements consist of fixed
rental payments, turnover rent and service charges totalling £2 million in 2022 (compared to £2 million
in 2021). The total undiscounted commitments relating to fixed rental payments on these leases are £22
million over the remaining term for each lease.

From time to time, our shareholders, or affiliates thereof, may also buy a portion of the Notes in the
open market or otherwise and may become lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement. For example,
certain of our shareholders (or other parties related to those shareholders), are lenders under the Senior
Facilities Agreement. In particular, as of 31 December 2022, KIRKBI Invest A/S held £479 million
(compared to £451 million in 2021) and funds advised by parties related to Blackstone held £32 million
(compared to £26 million in 2021) of facilities outstanding under the Senior Facilities Agreement.

In addition, our deferred income for the 2022 financial year includes an amount of less than £1 million
(compared to £2 million in the 2021 financial year) we received in 2020 from a KIRKBI affiliate (LEGO
Juris A/S) to support certain development activities. In 2022, we subsequently received an additional
£6 million as support for our development activities, of which less than £1 million remains to be spent.
Over the same period, we also contracted our payroll services for the North America region from UKG,
a related party of the Blackstone Investment Funds. The total fees paid to this company over the 2022
financial year amounted to than £1 million.

As of 31 December 2022, we held funds totalling £38,000 on behalf of KIRKBI Invest A/S, in
connection with the transfer and conversion of 505,876 ordinary A shares in TopCo.

We believe that all transactions with shareholders are negotiated and executed on an arm’s length basis.

**Transactions with Key Management Personnel**

In 2021, we introduced our Management Incentive Plans, which allowed eligible employees to invest
in the Group on customary terms and conditions. Pursuant to the Management Share Incentive Plans,
we issued preference shares and ordinary shares in our subsidiary Topco to senior management in
exchange for consideration. As of December 31, 2022, total management investment pursuant to the
Management Share Incentive Plans amounted to £4.5 million, compared to £4.4 million as of December
25, 2021.

As of 25 December 2021, two members of our key management team were provided with loans from
the Group equalling £120,000 in aggregate, to finance their participation to the Management Share
Incentive Plans. The loans were repaid during the course of the 2022 financial year. No interest was
payable on such loans.


-----

**Transactions with Other Related Parties**

As part of an agreement for the development and operation of LEGOLAND Malaysia, we have
subscribed for share capital in IDR which, together with its subsidiaries, owns LEGOLAND Malaysia
and its assets.

In May 2020, JVco issued shares aggregating to approximately five per cent. of its total share capital to
The Wellcome Trust for aggregate proceeds of £150 million.

In 2020 JVco issued fixed cumulative preference shares for a total consideration of £293 million. These
preference shares earn a fixed, cumulative, preferential dividend at the rate of 6% per annum, which
accrues (but is not payable) on each preference share on a daily basis from the date of issue of the
relevant preference share. Payment of these dividends is at the discretion of JVco and accordingly such
preference shares have been classified as equity. The nature and rights of these preference shares are
set out in note 1.1. of the audited financial statements for the 2022 financial year.

As of 31 December 2022, we held 20 per cent. of the issued share capital of IDR. In the 2022 financial
year, we made sales to IDR and its subsidiaries amounting to £3 million (compared to £2 million in the
2021 financial year) and were owed £2 million (compared to £2 million in the 2021 financial year) by
IDR and its subsidiaries.

In addition, as of 31 December 2022 we held a minority equity investment in, and have entered into
transactions with, Gangwon Jungdo Development Corporation Ltd, a South Korean company which
acts under the direction of the Gangwon Province. Gangwon Jungdo Development Corporation Ltd. has
provided funding and infrastructure support amounting to KRW 80 billion (£52 million at year end
exchange rates) in connection with the development of LEGOLAND Korea. As required under the
terms of the funding agreement entered into with this company, we have used the support funds received
to finance costs associated with the LEGOLAND Korea project. The conditions of the funding require
that following the completion of the park’s construction, we will operate the park for a certain period
of time post-opening. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, all funds have been received and
were recorded under deferred income.

In the course of our ordinary business activities, we may have other related party relationships with our
joint ventures and other co investors. We believe that all transactions with related parties are negotiated
and executed on an arm’s length basis.

**Transactions with Political Institutions**

The European Commission (“EC”) published a preliminary decision in November 2017, finding that
certain elements of the UK’s Controlled Foreign Company rules amount to unlawful State Aid. In April
2019, the EC announced its final decision that certain elements of these rules partially represent State
Aid. As a result, in the first quarter of 2021 we received charging notices from HMRC totalling £28
million, which we have duly paid. While the UK Government has made an annulment application
against the EC’s decision, however the EU General Court dismissed the UK’s application in June 2022.
The UK Government has subsequently lodged an appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Union.
As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we expect that the UK Government’s appeal will
ultimately be successful and accordingly we have recorded the £28 million paid to HMRC as receivables
as part of our non-current assets. If the appeal is ultimately unsuccessful, then this could result in an
increase in our future effective tax rate.

**Shareholders’ Agreement**

In connection with the Acquisition, the Consortium entered into a shareholders’ agreement (the
“Shareholders’ Agreement”) which governs their various rights in relation to their direct shareholding
in JVco and indirect shareholding in the subsidiaries of JVco.


-----

Pursuant to the Shareholders’ Agreement, Blackstone, CPP Investments and KIRKBI have the right to
nominate two members, one member and three members, respectively, of the board (each an “Investor
_Director”) of JVco, Merlin and each member of the group comprising JVco and its subsidiaries (the_
“Group”) (the “Boards”). Each Investor Director is, subject to certain exceptions, entitled to serve as a
member of each committee of the Boards. The CEO and CFO of Merlin have also been appointed to
the board of Merlin but do not have voting rights. Blackstone, CPP Investments and KIRKBI have a
right to nominate one observer, one observer and two observers, respectively, to the Boards. The
observers are entitled to participate in discussions on the Board but do not have any voting rights nor
are they liable in respect of such Board. Blackstone and KIRKBI have jointly nominated a
non-executive independent chairman to join the Board.

Subject to consent rights by Blackstone and KIRKBI, any decision by the Board requires approval of a
majority of the directors (provided that one Investor Director appointed by each of Blackstone and
KIRKBI vote in favour of the decision). Certain decisions regarding MAL and/or Merlin will require
the prior written approval of the Investor Directors appointed by each of Blackstone and KIRKBI. These
decisions include, among others, amendments to the organisational documents of MAL and/or Merlin,
any borrowing or financing that would cause Merlin to exceed a certain leverage ratio, changes to the
capital structure, the appointment and dismissal of key members of management, material changes in
the nature or scope of Merlin’s business and the winding up or dissolution of any Merlin company
(other than a dormant company). A narrower set of decisions requires the prior written approval of the
Investor Director appointed by CPP Investments.

The Shareholders’ Agreement contains certain exit rights, including in connection with an initial public
offering and the listing of the shares in the Group, and rights to require a Group refinancing as well as
restrictions on transferring shares in JVco and pursuing acquisition opportunities without first offering
the opportunities to the Group, in each case, on specified terms and subject to the occurrence of certain
conditions.

**Senior Facilities Agreement**

**_Overview and Structure_**

MAL (the “Company”) entered into a senior facilities agreement on 4 November 2019 between, among
others, the Company, Bank of America Europe Designated Activity Company (formerly Bank of
America Merrill Lynch International Designated Activity Company as Agent and Deutsche Bank AG,
London Branch as Security Agent (each as defined therein) as subsequently amended and restated by
an amendment and restatement agreement dated 17 December 2021 (the “Senior Secured Facilities
_Agreement”)._

The following term facilities were made available under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement: (i) a
Euro term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of €1,460,000,000 (“Facility B (EUR)”); (ii) a
USD term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1,210,000,000 (“Facility B1 (USD)”); and
(iii) a delayed draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $172,500,000, which was
automatically reallocated into a single fungible tranche of Facility B1 (USD) at the end of the first
interest period (“Facility B2 (USD)” and, together with Facility B EUR and Facility B1 (USD), the
“Original Senior Secured Term Facilities”). Facility B (EUR) and Facility B1 (USD) were utilised in
full on 12 November 2019. Facility B2 (USD) was utilised in full on 20 February 2020.

In addition a multi-currency revolving credit facility in a principal amount equal to £400,000,000 (the
“Original Senior Secured Revolving Facility” and, together with the Original Senior Secured Term
Facilities, the “Original Senior Secured Facilities”) was made available under the Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement.


-----

The Original Senior Secured Revolving Facility is available to be utilized from (and including) 4
November 2019 to (and including) the termination date of the Original Senior Secured Revolving
Facility (as set out below in the section entitled “Repayments”). The Original Senior Secured Revolving
Facility may be utilised in its base currency (being pounds sterling) or any agreed optional currency
(being euros, U.S. dollars and Danish kroner on the date of this Offering Memorandum) by way of cash
loans, letters of credit or ancillary facilities.

All amounts borrowed under the Original Senior Secured Revolving Facility may be applied in or
towards general corporate purposes and working capital purposes of the Group, including funding of
capital expenditure, restructuring costs, acquisitions, investments, joint ventures, operational
restructuring and reorganization requirements of the Group and fees, costs, expenses and taxes
(including stamp duty).

Incremental facilities may also be established under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement from time
to time (including by way of an increase to any existing facilities or the establishment of new facilities)
(“Incremental Senior Secured Facilities” and, together with the Original Senior Secured Facilities, the
“Senior Secured Facilities”).

**_Borrowers_**

The Original Senior Secured Term Facilities have been utilized in full by the Issuer.

The Original Senior Secured Revolving Facility may be utilised by the Company, the Issuer, Motion
Finco, LLC (“US FinCo”), Motion Finco 2 S.à r.l. (“Lux FinCo 2”), Merlin Entertainments Limited,
Merlin Entertainments Group Holdings Limited and certain other restricted subsidiaries of the Company
that may become Borrowers of the Original Senior Secured Revolving Facility in accordance with the
terms of the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement.

**_Interest and Fees_**

Loans under the Original Senior Secured Facilities shall initially bear interest at rates per annum equal
to LIBOR (or SONIA, EURIBOR or CIBOR in respect of loans denominated in sterling, euros or
Danish kroner (respectively) and, in respect of SONIA based loans only, a credit adjustment spread)
plus an applicable margin, which in each case are subject to a decreasing margin ratchet based on the
ratio of consolidated senior secured debt indebtedness to LTM EBITDA (each as defined in the Senior
Secured Facilities Agreement) (the “Consolidated Senior Secured Debt Ratio”).

If LIBOR (or the daily rate for SONIA, EURIBOR or CIBOR as applicable) is less than zero, LIBOR
(or SONIA, EURIBOR or CIBOR as applicable) shall be deemed to be zero for the purpose of
calculating the interest payable on loans under the Original Senior Secured Facilities.

A commitment fee is payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled commitments under the
Original Senior Secured Revolving Facility from the date of initial utilisation of the Original Senior
Secured Facilities to the end of the availability period applicable to the Original Senior Secured
Revolving Facility at a rate equal to 30 per cent. of the applicable margin for the Original Senior Secured
Revolving Facility. Such commitment fees are payable quarterly in arrears on such undrawn and
uncancelled commitments and (i) on any cancelled commitments under the Original Senior Secured
Revolving Facility on the date of their cancellation and (ii) on the last day of the availability period
applicable to the Original Senior Secured Revolving Facility.

Any letter of credit issued under the Original Senior Secured Revolving Facility shall be subject to such
issuing bank and fronting fees as may be agreed between the Company and the applicable issuing bank
and a letter of credit fee equal to the margin that would have been applicable to a cash drawn under the
Original Senior Secured Revolving Facility in the applicable currency.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1 per cent. on the defaulted amount.


-----

**_Repayments_**

The outstanding loans made under Facility B1 (USD) (including the commitments utilised by the Group
under Facility B2 (USD) which have been reallocated into Facility B1 (USD) to form a single fungible
tranche) are required to be repaid in instalments by repaying on each Quarter Date (as defined in the
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement) (commencing with the Quarter Date falling on 31 March 2020)
an amount which reduces the principal amount such loans drawn during the availability period by 0.25
per cent. of their outstanding principal amount from time to time, with the balance to be repaid in full
on 18 November 2026. The outstanding loans made under Facility B (EUR) are required to be repaid
in full on 18 November 2026.

Amounts repaid by the borrowers on loans made under the Original Senior Secured Term Facilities may
not be reborrowed.

In respect of the Original Senior Secured Revolving Facility, each advance will be repaid on the last
day of the interest period relating thereto, subject to an ability to roll over cash drawings. All outstanding
amounts under the Original Senior Secured Revolving Facility will be repaid on the date falling six and
a half years after initial utilisation of the Original Senior Secured Facilities, being 14 May 2026.

Amounts repaid by the Borrowers on loans made under the Original Senior Secured Revolving Facility
may be reborrowed, subject to certain conditions.

**_Mandatory Prepayment_**

The Senior Secured Facilities Agreement permits voluntary prepayments to be made (subject to de
minimis amounts) and require mandatory prepayment in full or in part in from, for each financial year
(commencing with the first full Financial Year ending after the Final Closing Date), a percentage of
excess cash flow in the event that excess cash flow exceeds a minimum threshold amount, which
percentage decreases as the Consolidated Senior Secured Debt Ratio decreases (an “Excess Cash Flow
_Prepayment”)._

At the election of the Company and subject to certain conditions, amounts required to be prepaid
pursuant to an Excess Cash Flow Prepayment may instead be applied in repayment of certain other
indebtedness of the Senior Secured Group.

Upon the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and
which follows terms substantially similar to the Notes as described in the section entitled “Description
_of Notes”), each lender shall be entitled to require prepayment of its commitments within a prescribed_
time period. A change of control shall include:

- any person or group becoming the beneficial owner of more than 50 per cent. of the voting
power of the Company, subject to certain conditions;

- subject to certain exclusions, the Parent ceasing to own 100 per cent. of the capital stock of the
Company; and

- a disposal of all or substantially all the assets of the Senior Secured Group.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

_Guarantor Coverage Test_

The Senior Secured Facilities are guaranteed by the Issuer, each borrower of the Senior Secured
Facilities (collectively, the “Borrowers”) and the same Guarantors as will guarantee the Notes (together,
the “Obligors”).


-----

The Senior Secured Facilities are secured by (i) share security granted by the holding company of each
Senior Secured Obligor or Material Subsidiary (as defined below) over its shares in the capital of that
Senior Secured Obligor or Material Subsidiary (as applicable), (ii) security over material, structural
intercompany loan receivables owed by the Company, the Issuer, Lux FinCo 2 or US FinCo (each an
“Original Senior Secured Obligor”) to other Original Senior Secured Obligors, (iii) security over the
material bank accounts (if any) of each Original Senior Secured Obligor (without control over use), (iv)
security over the business and assets of the Company pursuant to a floating charge and (v) security over

any state thereof (including the District of Columbia) and (B) over which security is capable of being
registered and perfected solely by customary UCC 1 filings in its jurisdiction of incorporation or
formation.

Subject to certain adjustments and agreed security principles in the Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement, the Company is required to ensure that members of the Senior Secured Group (i) that
generate at least 80 per cent. of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the section entitled “Description
_of Notes”) of the Group within certain agreed jurisdictions, namely, Australia, Denmark, Germany,_
Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States and the jurisdiction of
incorporation of any Borrower (the “Guarantor Coverage Test”) and (ii) that individually generate 5
per cent. or more of LTM EBITDA of the Group (a “Material Subsidiary”), in each case, are guarantors
under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement within 120 days of the date on which the annual financial
statements of the Company are required to be delivered to the agent under the Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement.

_Release of Guarantees and Security_

In addition to the circumstances described below under “—Intercreditor Agreement—Distressed
_Disposals” and “—Intercreditor Agreement—Non-distressed Disposals,” the Company may, subject to_
certain conditions, request the release of a guarantor from its guarantee under the Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement if (i) such guarantor is the subject of a third-party disposal or other permitted
activity under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement pursuant to which such guarantor will cease to
be a member of the Group, (ii) on a pro forma basis taking into account such release, the Guarantor
Coverage Test will continue to be satisfied or (iii) the lenders whose commitments under the Senior
Secured Facilities Agreement aggregate greater than 50 per cent. of the total commitments under such
facilities consent to such release. Upon the effectiveness of a release pursuant to the foregoing sentence,
the applicable guarantor would have no further obligations under the Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement, including any obligations to grant Security in any Collateral owned by such guarantor.

The provision and the terms of the security and guarantees set forth above will in all cases be subject to
certain limitations and are at all times and in all cases subject to the requirements of applicable law and
the other matters set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement.

**_Springing Financial Covenant and Liquidity Covenant applicable during the Financial Covenant_**
**_Waiver Period_**

Solely for the benefit of the lenders participating in the Original Senior Secured Revolving Facility (and
any Incremental Senior Secured Facility that is a revolving credit facility (together with the Original
Senior Secured Revolving Facility, the “Senior Secured Revolving Facilities”) and is elected by the
Company to benefit from such provision), the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement requires that, in the
event that the aggregate amount of all cash loans drawn under the Senior Secured Revolving Facilities
(excluding any amounts utilized to fund any original issue discount, market flex or acquisition costs
and net of cash and “Cash Equivalent Investments” (as defined in the Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement) held by the Senior Secured Group) exceeds 40 per cent. of the total revolving facility
commitments on the relevant testing date or, if higher, the total revolving facility commitments as of
the original date of the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement (the “Revolving Facility Financial
_Covenant Condition”), the Consolidated Senior Secured Debt Ratio does not exceed 10.00 to 1.00 (the_
“Financial Covenant”). The Consolidated Senior Secured Debt Ratio is based on the definitions and
adjustments in the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, which may differ from similar definitions in
the Indenture and the equivalent definitions described in this Offering Memorandum. Following expiry
of the “Financial Covenant Waiver Period” described below, the springing financial covenant under
our Revolving Facility is tested on each financial quarter date (being 31 March, 30 June, 30 September
and 31 December of each fiscal year) if the Revolving Facility is drawn above 40 per cent. by way of
cash loans (and excluding utilisations by way of letters of credit or under ancillary facilities and
excluding any amounts utilized to fund any OID, market flex or acquisition costs and net of cash and
“Cash Equivalent Investments” (as defined in the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement) held by the
Senior Secured Group) on such date. See “Risk Factors—Our substantial debt service obligations could
_adversely affect our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes.”_

The Senior Secured Facilities Agreement contains an equity cure provision enabling the shareholders
of the Company to make shareholder injections by way of subordinated shareholder funding and/or
equity to the Company to (i) increase the consolidated pro forma EBITDA under the Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement (an “EBITDA Cure”), (ii) decrease consolidated senior secured debt indebtedness
as defined in the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement (a “Net Debt Cure”), or (iii) prepay the Senior
Secured Revolving Facilities so that the Revolving Facility Financial Covenant Condition is no longer
satisfied. The EBITDA Cure and Net Debt Cure rights may not be exercised on more than five occasions
after the Final Closing Date in aggregate and may not be exercised on more than two occasions in any
four consecutive financial quarters.

A failure to comply with the Financial Covenant shall be automatically cured if the Financial Covenant
is complied with (or is not required to be tested as a result of the Revolving Facility Financial Covenant
Condition not being satisfied) on the following testing date, unless the requisite super majority lenders
under the Senior Secured Revolving Facilities have exercised their acceleration rights to declare all or
part of the loans under the Senior Secured Revolving Facilities to be immediately due and payable.

On May 28, 2021, the Company requested the consent of the majority of the lenders participating in the
Original Senior Secured Revolving Facility to a waiver of the requirement under the Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement that the Financial Covenant be tested (and met), subject in each case, to the
Revolving Facility Financial Covenant Condition having been met, on each financial quarter-end date
(the “Financial Covenant Waiver Request”), during any financial quarter-end date falling after (and
including) June 26, 2021 but prior to (and including) the earlier of: (a) July 1, 2023 and (b) any earlier
date selected by the Company (the “Financial Covenant Waiver Period”). The Financial Covenant
Waiver Request became effective on June 26, 2021.


-----

Under the terms of the Financial Covenant Waiver Request, on each financial quarter-end date falling
within the Financial Covenant Waiver Period (a “Relevant Quarter Date”), solely for the benefit of the
lenders participating in the Original Senior Secured Revolving Facility, the sum of: (x) cash and “Cash
Equivalent Investments” (as defined in the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement) held by the Senior
Secured Group; and (y) the aggregate commitments available to the Senior Secured Group under the
Original Senior Secured Revolving Facility and any available ancillary commitments under any
ancillary facility ((x) and (y) together being, “Liquidity”), is required to be at least £75,000,000 (or
equivalent) (the “Liquidity Covenant”).

The Financial Covenant Waiver Request requires the Company to deliver a compliance certificate (the
“Liquidity Compliance Certificate”) on or prior to the date falling 12 business days after each Relevant
Quarter Date confirming (solely for the benefit of the lenders participating in the Original Senior
Secured Revolving Facility) whether or not the Liquidity Covenant has been satisfied as at such
Relevant Quarter Date. If the Company fails to (x) comply with the Liquidity Covenant as at the
Relevant Quarter Date; or (y) deliver the Liquidity Compliance Certificate when due, in each case, an
event of default (the “Liquidity Condition Event of Default”) will occur on the date falling 20 business
days after the last date on which the Company is required to deliver the relevant Liquidity Compliance
Certificate (the “Liquidity Cure Date”) unless cured or remedied (as applicable) prior to the relevant
Liquidity Cure Date.

A Liquidity Condition Event of Default may be cured if, on or prior to the Liquidity Cure Date, the
Company delivers a Liquidity Compliance Certificate which certifies that the Liquidity of the Senior
Secured Group is sufficient such that, if the Liquidity Covenant were to be re-tested on such date, it
would have been satisfied.

A failure to comply with the Liquidity Covenant or to deliver the Liquidity Compliance Certificate
when due and, in each case, any Liquidity Condition Event of Default resulting therefrom, shall be
automatically cured if the Company delivers a Liquidity Compliance Certificate evidencing that the
Liquidity Covenant is complied with on the following testing date, unless the requisite super majority
lenders under the Original Senior Secured Revolving Facility have exercised their acceleration rights
to declare all or part of the loans under the Original Senior Secured Revolving Facility to be immediately
due and payable (and such exercise has not been rescinded prior to the following testing date).

-----

accompanying compliance certificates provided that the obligation to deliver financial information may
differ from similar requirements in the Indenture and as described in this Offering Memorandum.

Certain agreed covenants and other provisions of the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement will fall away
on the satisfaction of certain release conditions, being (i) the Senior Secured Facilities have obtained a
rating equal to or higher than Baa3 (or the equivalent) by Moody’s and BBB− (or the equivalent) by
Standard & Poor’s or Fitch, or if the applicable securities are not then rated by Moody’s, Standard &
Poor’s or Fitch, an equivalent rating by any other rating agency and (ii) no Default is continuing.

**_Events of Default_**

The Senior Secured Facilities Agreement provides for substantially the same events of default as under
the Notes. In addition, the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement provides for additional events of default,
subject to customary materiality qualifications and grace periods, including (i) breach of the Financial
Covenant, provided that (A) in the event of such breach, only the requisite super majority of the lenders
under the Senior Secured Revolving Facilities (the “Super majority Revolving Facility Lenders”) may
exercise acceleration rights as a result of such breach and (B) if the Super majority Revolving Facility
Lenders have exercised such acceleration rights as a result of such breach, the remaining lenders shall
have a right of cross acceleration; (ii) misrepresentation; (iii) invalidity and unlawfulness of the Senior
Secured Facilities financing documents; and (iv) material failure to comply with the Intercreditor
Agreement.

**_Governing Law_**

The Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in
connection with it, are governed by, construed in accordance with and will be enforced in accordance
with English law although certain information undertakings, restrictive covenants, events of default and
related definitions scheduled to the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement will be interpreted in
accordance with New York law (without prejudice to the fact that the Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement is governed by English law).

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, the Issuer,
the Parent Guarantor, Lux Finco 2, the U.S. Co Borrower and the other Subsidiary Guarantors are party
to an Intercreditor Agreement dated 4 November 2019 between, among others, the agent, arrangers and
lenders under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, the Existing 2026 Notes Trustee, the Existing
Senior Notes Trustee and the Security Agent.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and notwithstanding the terms of any Debt Document to the
contrary, the Notes shall be designated as notes ranking as Senior Secured Liabilities (“Senior Notes”)
in accordance with the terms and for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, provided that (i) the
Company gives prior notice to the Security Agent in writing that the Notes are to be designated as
“Senior Notes” for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) the Trustee under the Notes has
agreed to become a party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Senior Notes Trustee.

By accepting a Note, holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and
conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law and will set out various matters governing the
relationship of the creditors to our group including the relative ranking of certain debt of Motion Midco
Limited (the “Senior Parent”), Motion Bondco DAC (the “Existing Senior Notes Issuer”), the Issuer,
the Guarantors and any other person that becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor (as
defined below) or Third party Security Provider (as defined below), when payments can be made in


-----

respect of debt of the Debtors or Third party Security Providers, when enforcement action can be taken
in respect of that debt, the terms pursuant to which certain of that debt will be subordinated upon the
occurrence of certain insolvency events and turnover provisions and provisions related to the
enforcement of security.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions to be contained in the Intercreditor
Agreement. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and we urge you to read that
document because it, and not the discussion that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the
Notes and of the Trustee. Capitalised terms used but not defined herein have the meanings given to
them in the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Priority of Debts_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the liabilities owed by the Issuer and each other debtor under
the Intercreditor Agreement (together, the “Debtors”) shall rank in right of priority and payment in the
order, and are postponed and subordinated to any prior ranking liabilities, as set out below.

_Primary Creditor Liabilities—Other Than Senior Parent Independent Liabilities_

Liabilities (other than any Senior Parent Independent Liabilities, as defined below) owed to the creditors
described below (the “Primary Creditors”) by Debtors (other than a Senior Parent Debt Issuer to the
extent relating to Senior Parent Issuer Liabilities (each as defined below)) shall rank in right of priority
and payment in the following order and are postponed and subordinated to any prior ranking liabilities
as follows:

(a) **first, liabilities owed to:**

(i) the arrangers, agents, trustees, lenders, issuing banks, ancillary lenders and the
Security Agent in relation to the Notes, the Existing 2026 Notes, the Senior
Secured Facilities Agreement and any future senior secured loans, notes or
other indebtedness borrowed and/or issued by any of the Company or its
Restricted Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Senior Secured Group”), other than
any Operating Facility (as defined below) (“Permitted Senior Financing
_Debt”), such liabilities together being the “Senior Secured Liabilities”;_

(ii) the arrangers, agents, trustees, lenders, issuing banks, ancillary lenders and the
Security Agent in relation to any future second lien loans, notes or other
indebtedness borrowed and/or issued by a member of the Senior Secured
Group (“Second Lien Debt”), such liabilities together being the “Second Lien
Liabilities”;

(iii) the hedge counterparties in relation to any hedging agreements, such liabilities
together being the “Hedging Liabilities”;

(iv) the creditors in relation to any cash management or other facility which is
designated as an “Operating Facility” under the Intercreditor Agreement (an
“Operating Facility”), such liabilities together being the “Operating Facility
_Liabilities”; and_

(v) the agents, trustees and the Security Agent (in each case for their own account
and not on behalf of the applicable lenders and/or noteholders) in relation to
the Existing Senior Notes and any future loans, notes or other indebtedness
(“Permitted Parent Financing Debt” and, together with the Existing Senior
Notes, “Senior Parent Debt”), borrowed and/or issued by the Senior Notes
Issuer or any other member of the Senior Parent Group, which is designated as
an issuer of Senior Parent under the Intercreditor Agreement (a “Senior Parent


-----

_Debt Issuer”), such liabilities together being the “Senior Parent Agent_
_Liabilities,”_

_pari passu and without any preference amongst them; and_

(b) **second, liabilities owed to the arrangers, agents, trustees, lenders and Security Agent**
in respect of the Senior Parent Debt and in each case (A) including, without limitation,
liabilities in respect of any proceeds loan (a “Senior Parent Debt Proceeds Loan”)
pursuant to which the proceeds of any Senior Parent Debt are on lent to a member of
the Senior Secured Group (“Senior Parent Debt Proceeds Loan Liabilities”) and (B)
excluding any Senior Parent Agent Liabilities and any Senior Parent Independent
Liabilities, such liabilities together being the “Senior Parent Shared Guarantee
_Liabilities,” pari passu and without any preference amongst them._

_Primary Creditor Liabilities—Senior Parent Issuer Liabilities_

Liabilities owed to the Primary Creditors by a Senior Parent Debt Issuer (to the extent that such
liabilities relate to the Senior Parent Debt borrowed / issued by such Senior Parent Debt Issuer) (the
“Senior Parent Issuer Liabilities”) rank pari passu and without any preference amongst them with the
Senior Secured Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities, the Operating Facility
Liabilities and the Senior Parent Agent Liabilities owed by such Senior Parent Debt Issuer.

_Primary Creditor Liabilities—Senior Parent Independent Guarantee Liabilities_

The Intercreditor Agreement does not rank or restrict the payment by any person which is a guarantor
of the Senior Parent Debt but is not a member of the Senior Secured Group, has not guaranteed any
Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities or Operating Facility Liabilities
and is not a Senior Parent Debt Issuer (a “Senior Parent Independent Guarantor”) of any liabilities of
any such person in respect of any Senior Parent Debt (the “Senior Parent Independent Guarantee
_Liabilities,” together with the Senior Parent Issuer Liabilities, the “Senior Parent Independent_
_Liabilities” and together with the Senior Parent Issuer Liabilities, the Senior Parent Agent Liabilities_
and the Senior Parent Shared Guarantee Liabilities, the “Senior Parent Liabilities”) or any other
liabilities of any such person.

_Intra Group and Investor Liabilities_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that any Intra Group liabilities owed by one member of the Senior
Secured Group to another member of the Senior Secured Group (other than any Senior Parent Debt
Proceeds Loan Liabilities) (the “Intra Group Liabilities”) and any liabilities (the “Investor Liabilities”)
owed by a member of the Senior Parent Group to a holding company or the Senior Parent Group or to
any other person who becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as an Investor (an “Investor”), will
be subordinated to the liabilities owed to the Primary Creditors by the Debtors in respect of the Senior
Secured Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities, the Operating Facility
Liabilities and the Senior Parent Liabilities (together, the “Secured Liabilities”).

The Senior Parent Debt Issuer and Existing Senior Notes Issuer are party to the Intercreditor Agreement
as Investors.

The Intercreditor Agreement does not purport to rank any of the Investor Liabilities or the Intra Group
Liabilities as between themselves.

_Transaction Security_

Each of the parties to the Intercreditor Agreement agrees that the Transaction Security (as defined
below) shall secure the liabilities regulated by the Intercreditor Agreement (but only to the extent that
such Transaction Security is expressed to secure those liabilities) in the following order:


-----

(a) **first, the Senior Secured Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities, the Operating Facility**
Liabilities, the liabilities owed to the agents, trustees and the Security Agent (in each
case for their own account and not on behalf of the applicable lenders and/or
noteholders) in relation to the Second Lien Liabilities (the “Second Lien Agent
_Liabilities”) and the Senior Parent Agent Liabilities_ _pari passu and without any_
preference amongst them;

(b) **second, the Second Lien Liabilities (other than the Second Lien Agent Liabilities) pari**
_passu and without any preference amongst them; and_

(c) **third (to the extent of any Shared Security), the Senior Parent Liabilities (other than**
the Senior Parent Agent Liabilities) pari passu and without any preference amongst
them.

_Additional Debt_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to certain conditions, for the implementation of existing,
additional, supplemental or new financing arrangements that may or may not constitute Secured
Liabilities (including any of the classes of Secured Liabilities described in the section entitled “Primary
_Creditor Liabilities” above) (“Additional Debt”), provided that the incurrence of such Additional Debt_
is not prohibited by the Indenture, the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, the Existing 2026 Notes
Indenture, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture or any other loan agreement, notes indenture or other
debt instrument pursuant to which any prior Additional Debt is borrowed or issued (as applicable) (each
a “Debt Financing Agreement”).

Such financing arrangements may be implemented by way of refinancing, replacement, increase or
otherwise restructuring in whole or in part under the relevant finance documents.

In connection with and in order to facilitate any Additional Debt, each party to the Intercreditor
Agreement shall be required to enter into any amendment to or replacement of the then current Debt
Documents (as defined below) (including for the purpose of reflecting the terms and ranking of any
Additional Debt) and/or take such other action as is required by the Company in order to facilitate such
Additional Debt.

The amendments and replacements in the foregoing paragraph shall extend to any changes to, the taking
of, or the release coupled with the retaking of, any guarantee or security interest including granted in
respect of any of the Secured Liabilities.

Each lender, noteholder or similar creditor authorises and instructs its respective facility agent, notes
trustee or other creditor representative and the Security Agent to (unless such person is required under
applicable law to act in its own name, in which case it shall) enter into any such amendment to the
Intercreditor Agreement and such other Debt Document required by the Company to reflect, enable
and/or facilitate any such arrangements (including as regards the ranking of any such arrangements) to
the extent such financing, refinancing, replacement and/or sharing is not prohibited by the Debt
Financing Agreements to which the relevant Secured Party is a party.

_Priority Revolving Facilities_

The Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions which (i) facilitate the incurrence of revolving
facilities ranking, or the elevation of existing revolving facilities to rank, in priority to the other Senior
Secured Liabilities (other than any other such revolving facilities incurred or elevated with such
ranking) with respect to the right to receive proceeds from an enforcement of the Transaction Security
and certain distressed disposals, in each case to the extent not prohibited by the Debt Financing
Agreements (“Priority Revolving Facilities”) and (ii) to the extent that any Priority Revolving Facilities
have been incurred, permit certain Hedging Liabilities and Operating Facility Liabilities to be incurred
and/or elevated, such that they shall rank pari passu with the Priority Revolving Facilities with respect


-----

to the right to receive proceeds from an enforcement of the Transaction Security and certain distressed
disposals.

To the extent incurred, such Priority Revolving Facilities may have different rights and obligations than
the other Senior Secured Liabilities, including with respect to the right to instruct the Security Agent to
enforce the Transaction Security. The terms in the Intercreditor Agreement applicable to Priority
Revolving Facilities are not described in further detail in this description.

The incurrence of Priority Revolving Facilities are not permitted by the Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement prior to the discharge of the term facilities made available thereunder, unless otherwise
agreed by the requisite lenders.

_Supplemental Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement permits supplemental security to be granted in favour of any Hedging
Liabilities and/or Operating Liabilities in order to ensure that such Hedging Liabilities and/or Operating
Liabilities benefit from security interests over the assets subject to the Transaction Security.

_Existing 2026 Notes_

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Existing 2026 Notes were designated as Senior Notes for
the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement. The trustee from time to time under the Existing Senior
Secured 2026 Indenture (the “Existing 2026 Notes Trustee”) became a party to the Intercreditor
Agreement as a Senior Notes Trustee on 19 November 2019.

Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and notwithstanding any other term of any other
Debt Document (other than the Existing Senior Secured 2026 Indenture) (i) the liabilities in respect of
the Existing 2026 Notes existing on the date of the Intercreditor Agreement (the “Existing 2026 Notes
_Pre Existing Liabilities”) may not be released or otherwise compromised pursuant to the provisions of_
the Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) no requirement to share any payment or distribution of, or on
account of or in relation to (including without limitation by way of set off), any of the liabilities from
any member of the Senior Secured Group or a Third party Security Provider (“Recoveries”) shall apply
to any Recovery by the holders of the Existing 2026 Notes or the Existing 2026 Notes Trustee made in
respect of the Existing 2026 Notes Pre Existing Liabilities, except solely to the extent such Recovery is
made under the Transaction Security Documents (as defined below).

To the extent that any applicable Recoveries that are to be distributed to the Existing 2026 Notes Trustee
as described in the section entitled “—Application of Proceeds” below at a time when and to the extent
the relevant accrued liabilities in respect of the Existing 2026 Notes are not then due and payable (such
amount being the “Relevant Amount”), the Relevant Amount shall be paid into a holding account for
the benefit of the Existing 2026 Notes Trustee and such amount shall be treated as having been applied
in satisfaction of the liabilities in respect of the Existing 2026 Notes for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement.

To the extent that an asset of a member of the Senior Secured Group is permitted (or deemed or required
to be permitted) by the other Primary Creditors (other than the Operating Facility Lenders) to be
released from the Transaction Security, the Security Agent shall also be authorised to release the such
asset from the Transaction Security by the Existing 2026 Notes Trustee.

Nothing in the foregoing paragraph or the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to
distressed disposals shall permit the Security Agent to release the borrowing claims of MEL with respect
to the Existing 2026 Notes.


-----

**_Permitted Payments_**

_Permitted Payments—Senior Secured Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities and Operating Facility Liabilities_

The Debtors and Third party Security Providers may make payment in respect of the Senior Secured
Liabilities, the Operating Facility Liabilities and (subject to the further conditions below) the Hedging

respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities that are in the form of loans or hedging liabilities (the “Majority
_Senior Creditors”), the Trustee, the Existing 2026 Notes Trustee and each notes trustee in respect of_
Permitted Senior Financing Debt in the form of notes (each a “Senior Secured Notes Trustee”) (or,
following the discharge of all Senior Secured Liabilities (the “Senior Secured Discharge Date”), the
creditors holding greater than 50 per cent. of the credit participations in respect of the Second Lien
Liabilities (the “Majority Second Lien Creditors”)).

In addition, the Debtors and Third party Security Providers are restricted from making certain payments
in respect of Hedging Liabilities without the consent of the Majority Senior Creditors if, among other
conditions, such payments do not related to scheduled payments under the applicable hedging
agreements, certain agreed mandatory prepayment events, non-credit related close outs and/or permitted
enforcement action.

_Permitted Payments—Second Lien Liabilities_

Prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the date on which all Operating Facility
Liabilities have been discharged (such later date, the “Senior Discharge Date”), the Debtors and the

Lien Liabilities (including any capitalised interest), such payment is (A) not prohibited

Financing Agreement (in compliance with the applicable consent thresholds set out
therein) (the “Required Senior Consent”); or

(c) such payment is (i) in respect of certain customary exceptions for the payment fees,
costs, expenses, agency liabilities and the satisfaction of certain mandatory prepayment

Secured Agent, a “Senior Agent”) may deliver a notice (a “Second Lien Payment Stop Notice”)
specifying the event or circumstance giving rise to the relevant Material Event of Default to the
Company, the Security Agent and Second Lien Creditor Representative), and such Second Lien

“Second Lien Secured Creditors”) an amount equal to any payments which had accrued
under the finance documents in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities (the “Second Lien

**_Effect of Insolvency Event_**

“Insolvency Event” is defined as, in relation to any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third party
Security Provider, (a) any resolution is passed or order made for the winding up, dissolution,
examinership, administration or reorganisation of that member of the Senior Secured Group, a
moratorium is declared in relation to any indebtedness of that member of the Senior Secured Group or
an administrator is appointed to that member of the Senior Secured Group or Third party Security
Provider, (b) any composition, compromise, assignment or arrangement is made with its creditors
generally, (c) the appointment of any liquidator, receiver, administrator, administrative receiver,
compulsory manager, examiner or other similar officer in respect of that member of the Senior Secured
Group or Third party Security Provider or any of its material assets or (d) any analogous procedure or
step is taken in any jurisdiction, in each case to the extent constituting an Insolvency Event of Default
which is continuing and provided that:

(a) if prior to the Senior Discharge Date, that Insolvency Event of Default is an Insolvency
Event of Default in respect of Senior Secured Liabilities and the applicable Senior
Agent in respect of such Senior Secured Liabilities has declared by written notice to
the Security Agent, each other Agent and the Company that an “Insolvency Event” has
occurred;

(b) if prior to the Second Lien Discharge Date, that Insolvency Event of Default is an
Insolvency Event of Default in respect of Second Lien Liabilities and the relevant
Second Lien Creditor Representative (to the extent expressly permitted by the relevant
Debt Financing Agreement) has declared by written notice to the Security Agent, each
other Agent and the Company that an “Insolvency Event” has occurred; or

(c) if on or after the First/Second Lien Discharge Date, that Insolvency Event of Default is
an Insolvency Event of Default in respect of Senior Parent Liabilities and the applicable
Senior Parent Agent in respect of such Senior Parent Liabilities has declared by written
notice to the Security Agent, each other Agent and the Company that an “Insolvency
_Event” has occurred._


-----

“Insolvency Event of Default” means, in respect of the Notes, an Event of Default described under
“Description of Notes—Events of Default and Remedies” or, in respect of any other Secured Liabilities,
any substantially equivalent Event of Default under the applicable Debt Financing Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event or an
Acceleration Event which is continuing or any party to the Intercreditor Agreement entitled to receive
a distribution out of the assets of a Debtor (or, following an Acceleration Event, any member of the
Senior Secured Group) or (to the extent arising from any Third party Security) Third party Security
Provider in respect of liabilities owed to such party shall (in the case of any Creditor, only to the extent
that such distribution would otherwise constitute a receipt or recovery of a type subject to the provisions
set out above under “—Turnover”) and, in all cases if prior to a Distress Event, only if required by the
Security Agent acting on the instructions of an Instructing Group), subject to receiving payment
instructions and any other relevant information from the Security Agent and to the extent it is able to
do so, direct the person responsible for the distribution of the assets of that member of the Senior
Secured Group or Third party Security Provider to pay that distribution to the Security Agent until the
liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full.

To the extent that any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third party Security Provider’s liabilities
to creditors are, with certain exceptions, discharged by way of set off (mandatory or otherwise) after
the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to that member of the Senior Secured Group, any
Creditor which benefited from that set off shall, subject to receiving payment instructions and any other
relevant information from the Security Agent, pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed
to it which are discharged by that set off to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the
provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

Subject to certain exceptions as set out in “—Distressed Disposals” and “—Non-distressed Disposals”
below, if the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in
cash in respect of any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except
to the extent that the realization proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

Subject to certain netting and set off rights under a multi account overdraft facility, each creditor
irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent to take Enforcement Action (as defined below), make
demands, collect and receive distributions, file claims and take other actions necessary to make recovery
after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to an Obligor, member of the Senior Secured
Group or Third party Security Provider. The creditors agree to do all things the Security Agent
reasonably requests in order to give effect to these provisions.

delay the commencement of enforcement of the Transaction Security would reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on:

(i) the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the Transaction Security; or

(ii) the realisation proceeds of any enforcement of the Transaction Security,

and, where this paragraph applies:

(A) any instructions shall be limited to those necessary to protect or

from enforcing the Senior Parent Independent Transaction Security as they see fit.

The Security Agent shall enforce the Senior Parent Independent Transaction Security in such manner

enforcement of any Transaction Security or (ii) take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action in
relation to the Second Lien Liabilities, except as set out under “—Permitted Second Lien Enforcement”
provided, however, that no such action required by the Security Agent need be taken except to the extent
the Security Agent is otherwise entitled under the Intercreditor Agreement to direct such action.

_Permitted Second Lien Enforcement_

The restrictions set out above under “—Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Secured Creditors”
do not apply if:

(a) an event of default (a “Second Lien Event of Default”) under any Debt Financing
Agreement in respect of Second Lien Liabilities (the “Relevant Second Lien Default”)
is continuing;

(b) each Senior Agent has received a notice of the Relevant Second Lien Default specifying
the event or circumstance in relation to the Relevant Second Lien Default from the
relevant Second Lien Creditor Representative;

(c) a Second Lien Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

Standstill Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of a Second Lien Event of Default, the relevant Second Lien Creditor
Representative may by notice (a “Second Lien Enforcement Notice”) in writing notify the Senior Agents
of the existence of such Second Lien Event of Default.

In relation to a Relevant Second Lien Default, a Second Lien Standstill Period shall mean the period
(the “Second Lien Standstill Period”) beginning on the date (the “Second Lien Standstill Start Date”)
the relevant Second Lien Creditor Representative serves a Second Lien Enforcement Notice on each of

of:

(a) the date falling 120 days after the Second Lien Standstill Start Date;

(b) the date the Senior Secured Parties (other than the Second Lien Secured Creditors) take
any Enforcement Action in relation to a borrower (a “Second Lien Borrower”) or
guarantor (a “Second Lien Guarantor”) of Second Lien Liabilities, provided, however,
that if a Second Lien Standstill Period ends pursuant such Enforcement Action, the
Second Lien Secured Creditors may only take the same Enforcement Action in relation


-----

to the relevant Second Lien Borrower or Second Lien Guarantor as the Enforcement
Action taken by the Senior Secured Parties (other than the Second Lien Secured
Creditors) against such Second Lien Borrower or Second Lien Guarantor and not
against any other member of the Senior Secured Group;

(c) the date of an Insolvency Event in relation to the relevant Second Lien Borrower or a
particular Second Lien Guarantor against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

(d) the expiry of any other Second Lien Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first
mentioned Second Lien Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a
result of a cure, waiver or other permitted remedy);

(e) the date on which the consent of each of the Senior Secured Agents (acting on the
instructions of the requisite majority of Senior Secured Creditors represented thereby)
has been obtained; and

(f) a failure to pay the principal amount outstanding under any Second Lien Debt at the
final stated maturity of the amounts outstanding on that Second Lien Debt (provided
_that, unless otherwise agreed by the Company and the majority lenders under the Senior_
Secured Facilities Agreement, prior to the Senior Discharge Date, such maturity date
or any shortening thereof is permitted by the Debt Financing Agreements in respect of
the Senior Secured Liabilities).

_Enforcement on behalf of Second Lien Secured Creditors_

If the Security Agent has notified the Second Lien Creditor Representatives that it is enforcing Security
created pursuant to any Transaction Security Document over shares of a Second Lien Borrower or a
Second Lien Guarantor, no Second Lien Secured Creditor may take any action referred to above against
that Second Lien Borrower or Second Lien Guarantor (or any subsidiary of that Second Lien Borrower
or Second Lien Guarantor) while the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that Security in
accordance with the instructions of an Instructing Group where such action might be reasonably likely
to adversely affect such enforcement or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

_Option to Purchase: Second Lien Creditors_

Following acceleration or the enforcement of Transaction Security upon acceleration under any Senior
Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Secured Creditors may, by giving not less than ten days’ notice, elect
to purchase all but not part of the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Operating Facility Liabilities for
the amount that would have been required to prepay or redeem such liabilities on such date plus certain
costs and expenses. Second Lien Secured Creditors must also elect for the Hedge Counterparties to
transfer their Hedging Liabilities to such Second Lien Secured Creditors in exchange (subject to
specified conditions) for the amount that would have been payable under such Hedging Liabilities had
they been terminated on such date plus certain costs and expenses in connection with any such purchase.

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Senior Parent Creditors_

Until the First/Second Lien Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by an
Instructing Group (i) no Senior Parent Creditor or Senior Parent Investor shall direct the Security Agent
to enforce or otherwise require the enforcement of any Shared Security, (ii) no Senior Parent Creditor
or Senior Parent Investor shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action in relation to the
Senior Parent Shared Guarantee Liabilities or (iii) no Senior Parent Creditor, Investor or Senior Parent
Debt Issuer shall take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action in relation to the Senior Parent
Debt Proceeds Loan Liabilities, except as set out under “—Permitted Senior Parent Enforcement”
provided, however, that no such action required by the Security Agent need be taken except to the extent
the Security Agent is otherwise entitled under the Intercreditor Agreement to direct such action.

from the relevant Senior Parent Agent;

(c) a Senior Parent Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

existence of such Senior Parent Event of Default.

In relation to a Relevant Senior Parent Default, a Senior Parent Standstill Period shall mean the period
(the “Senior Parent Standstill Period”) beginning on the date (the “Senior Parent Standstill Start Date”)

Agents in respect of such Relevant Senior Parent Default and ending on the earliest to occur of:

Debt Proceeds Loan Liabilities, the relevant Senior Parent Invest may only take the
same Enforcement Action in relation to the relevant Senior Parent Guarantor as the

Guarantor and not against any other member of the Senior Secured Group or (to the
extent not a Senior Parent Guarantor) Third party Security Provider;

(c) the date of an Insolvency Event in relation to the relevant Senior Parent Debt Issuer or
a particular Senior Parent Guarantor against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;

mentioned Senior Parent Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a
result of a cure, waiver or other permitted remedy);

(e) the date on which the consent of each of the Senior Agents (acting on the instructions
of the requisite majority of Senior Creditors represented thereby) has been obtained;
and

(f) a failure to pay the principal amount outstanding under any Senior Parent Debt at the
final stated maturity of the amounts outstanding on that Senior Parent Debt (provided
_that, prior to the First/Second Lien Discharge Date, such maturity date or any_
shortening thereof is permitted by the Debt Financing Agreements in respect of the
Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities).


-----

_Enforcement on Behalf of Senior Parent Creditors_

If the Security Agent has notified the Senior Parent Agents or the relevant Senior Parent Investor that
it is enforcing Security created pursuant to any Security Document over shares of a Senior Parent
Guarantor, no Senior Parent Creditor or that Senior Parent Investor may take any action referred to
above against that Senior Parent Guarantor (or any subsidiary of that Senior Parent Guarantor) while
the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce that Security in accordance with the instructions of an
Instructing Group where such action might be reasonably likely to adversely affect such enforcement
or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

_Option to Purchase: Senior Parent Creditors_

Following acceleration or the enforcement of Transaction Security upon acceleration under any Senior
Secured Liabilities, Senior Parent Creditors may, by giving not less than ten days’ notice, elect to
purchase all but not part of the Senior Secured Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Operating
Facility Liabilities for the amount that would have been required to prepay or redeem such liabilities on
such date plus certain costs and expenses. Senior Parent Creditors must also elect for the Hedge
Counterparties to transfer their Hedging Liabilities to such Senior Parent Creditors in exchange (subject
to specified conditions) for the amount that would have been payable under such Hedging Liabilities
had they been terminated on such date plus certain costs and expenses in connection with any such
purchase.

**_Non-distressed Disposals_**

The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the Secured Parties) agrees that it shall (and is irrevocably
authorized, instructed and obliged to do so without further consent, agreement or instruction from any
Creditor or Debtor) promptly upon the receipt of a request from the relevant Debtor or the Company:

(a) promptly release (or procure the release) from the Transaction Security or Senior Parent
Independent Transaction Security and the Secured Debt Documents:

(i) any Security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset
which the Parent has confirmed is the subject of:

(A) a disposal not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing
Agreement (including a disposal to a member of the Senior Secured
Group but without prejudice to any obligation of any member of the
Senior Secured Group in a Debt Financing Agreement to provide
replacement security); or

(B) any other transaction not prohibited by the terms of any Debt
Financing Agreement pursuant to which that asset will cease to be held
or owned by a member of the Senior Secured Group;

(ii) any Security (and/or any other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any
document or other agreement requested in order for any member of the Senior
Secured Group to effect any amendment or waiver in respect of that document
or agreement or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any obligations or
take any action in relation to that document or agreement (in each case to the
extent not prohibited by the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement);

(iii) any Security (and/or any other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any
asset of any member of the Senior Secured Group which has ceased to be a
Debtor (or will cease to be a Debtor simultaneously with such release); and


-----

(iv) any Security (and/or any other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any
other asset to the extent that such release is in accordance with the terms of the
Debt Financing Agreements; and

(b) in the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor (or any
holding company of any Debtor), or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor
(or any holding company of any Debtor) will cease to be a member of the Senior Parent
Group or a Debtor, the Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the Secured Parties)
agrees and is irrevocably authorized and instructed to do so without any consent,
sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor, Operating Facility
Lender, other Secured Party or Debtor) to promptly release (or procure that any other
relevant person releases) that Debtor and its Subsidiaries from all present and future
liabilities (both actual and contingent) under the Secured Debt Documents and the
respective assets of such Debtor and its Subsidiaries (and the shares in any such Debtor
and/or Subsidiary) from the Transaction Security or Senior Parent Independent
Transaction Security and the Secured Debt Documents (including any claim relating to
a Debt Document and any guarantee liabilities or other liabilities (not being borrower
or guarantee liabilities)).

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraphs (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above, the Company shall
confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that the relevant disposal or other action is not prohibited by
the terms of any Debt Financing Agreement and, for any request for a release pursuant to paragraph
(a)(iv) above, the Parent shall confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that the relevant disposal or
other action is in accordance with the terms of the Debt Financing Agreements.

Without prejudice to the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, if requested by the Company in
accordance with the terms of any of the Debt Financing Agreements (and provided that the requested
action is not expressly prohibited by any of the other Debt Financing Agreements), the Security Agent
and the other Creditors shall (at the cost of the relevant Debtor and/or the Company) promptly execute
any guarantee, security or other release and/or any amendment, supplement or other documentation
relating to the Security Documents as contemplated by the terms of any of the Debt Financing
Agreements (and the Security Agent is authorised to execute, and will promptly execute if requested by
the Company, without the need for any further consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from
any Creditor, any such release or document on behalf of the Creditors). When making any request
pursuant to this paragraph the Company shall confirm in writing to the Security Agent that such request
is in accordance with the terms of a Debt Financing Agreement (and the requested action is not expressly
prohibited by any of the other Debt Financing Agreements) and the Security Agent shall be entitled to
rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured Debt Documents.

For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Debt Document, nothing
in any Security Document shall operate or be construed so as to prevent any transaction, matter or other
step not prohibited by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or the Debt Financing Agreements (a
“Permitted Action”). The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the Secured Parties) hereby agrees
(and is irrevocably authorised and instructed to do so without any consent, sanction, authority or further
confirmation from any party to the Intercreditor Agreement) that it shall (at the request and cost of the
relevant Debtor or the Company) promptly execute any release or other document and/or take such
other action under or in relation to any Debt Document (or any asset subject or expressed to be subject
to any Security Document) as is requested by the Company in order to complete, implement or facilitate
a Permitted Action. In the event that the Company makes any request pursuant to and in reliance on the
preceding sentence, the Security Agent shall be permitted to request a confirmation from the Company
that the relevant transaction, matter or other step is a Permitted Action and the Security Agent shall be
entitled to rely on that confirmation for all purposes under the Secured Debt Documents.

**_Distressed Disposals_**

_Distressed Disposal Definition_

“Distressed Disposal” means a disposal of an asset or shares of, or shares issued by, a member of the
Senior Secured Group or, in the case of a Third party Security Provider, any asset of a Third party
Security Provider which is subject to Transaction Security, which is (a) being effected at the request of
an Instructing Group in circumstances where the Transaction Security has become enforceable in
accordance with the terms of the relevant Transaction Security Documents, (b) being effected by
enforcement of the Transaction Security in accordance with the terms of the relevant Transaction
Security Documents, or (c) being effected, after the occurrence of a Distress Event, by a Debtor or a
Third party Security Provider to a person or persons which is not a member of the Senior Secured
Group.

_Release and Transfer of Liabilities_

Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement dealing with the Existing 2026 Notes (see “—
_Existing 2026 Notes”) and to the following paragraphs, if a Distressed Disposal is being effected the_
Security Agent is irrevocably authorised (at the cost of the relevant Debtor, Third party Security
Provider or the Company and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any
Creditor, other Secured Party, Third party Security Provider or Debtor):

(a) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over the asset which is the subject
of the Distressed Disposal and execute and deliver or enter into any release of that
Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallisation of any floating
charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be
considered necessary or desirable;

(b) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, to release
(i) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing,
guarantee or other liabilities, (ii) any Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or
any subsidiary of that Debtor over any of its assets and (iii) any other claim of any
Senior Parent Investor, Investor, Intra Group Lender or other Debtor over that Debtor’s
assets or over the assets of any Subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant
Creditors, Third party Security Providers, Debtors and Agents;

(c) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company
of a Debtor, to release (A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding
company from all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities, (B) any
Transaction Security granted by that holding company or any subsidiary of that holding
company over any of its assets, and (C) any other claim of any Senior Parent Investor,
Investor, Intra Group Lender or other Debtor over that holding company’s assets or
over the assets of any Subsidiary of that holding company, on behalf of the relevant
Creditors, Debtors, Third party Security Provider and Agents;

(d) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the
holding company of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities owed by
such Debtor or holding company or any of their subsidiaries to creditors or other
Debtors:

(i) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement)
does not intend that any transferee of those liabilities (the “Transferee”) will
be treated as a Primary Creditor (other than an Operating Facility Lender) or a
Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and
deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities,


-----

_provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any Debt Document, the_
Transferee shall not be treated as a Primary Creditor (other than an Operating
Facility Lender) or a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement; and

(ii) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement)
does intend that any Transferee will be treated as a Primary Creditor (other
than an Operating Facility Lender) or a Secured Party for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement
to dispose of all (and not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Primary
Creditors and all or part of any other liabilities and the liabilities owed to any
Debtor (“Debtor Liabilities”), on behalf of, in each case, the relevant Creditors,
Third party Security Provider and Debtors;

(e) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the
holding company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting
in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor
(the “Receiving Entity”) all or any part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any
obligations of a subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of the Intra Group
Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to:

(i) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those Intra Group Liabilities
or Debtor Liabilities on behalf of the relevant creditors of such liabilities and
on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(ii) (if the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is
also a guarantor of Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities) to
accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those Intra
Group Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities on behalf of the Receiving Entity or
Receiving Entities to which the obligations in respect of those Intra Group
Liabilities or Debtor Liabilities are to be transferred.

_Proceeds of Distressed Disposals_

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as
described above) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions
set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below (to the extent that the asset disposed were subject to
the Transaction Security, as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction
Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities or Debtor Liabilities has occurred, as if that
disposal of liabilities or Debtor Liabilities had not occurred).

_Market Value_

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the
Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), the Security Agent shall take
reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions (though the Security
Agent shall have no obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in
order to achieve a higher price).

_Transfer of Liabilities_

Where borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities would otherwise be released pursuant to the paragraphs
above, the Creditor or Operating Facility Lender concerned may elect to have those borrowing or
guarantee liabilities and/or, as the case may be, other liabilities transferred to the Company in which
case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorised (to the extent legally possible and at the cost of the
relevant Debtor or the Company and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation


-----

from any Creditor, other Secured Party or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so
transfer those borrowing or guarantee liabilities and/or, as the case may be, other liabilities.

_Fair Value Protections—Senior Secured Creditors_

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to paragraph (d)(ii) of the
provisions entitled “—Release and Transfer of Liabilities” above) effected by or at the request of the
Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), unless the consent of each
Senior Agent at such time (other than the Existing 2026 Notes Trustee (see “—Existing 2026 Notes”)),
is otherwise obtained, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal under those provisions
above that:

(a) the proceeds of such disposal are in cash (or substantially all in cash); and

(b) such sale or disposal is made:

(i) pursuant to an auction (public or private) or other competitive sale process (a
“Public Auction”) in which more than one bidder participates or is invited to
participate, which may or may not be conducted through a court or other legal
proceeding, and which is conducted with the advice of an internationally
recognised investment bank or internationally recognised accounting firm
selected by the Security Agent or, if all of the internationally recognised
investment banks and internationally recognised accounting firms are subject
to conflicting and client or potential client issues and are unable to act in
relation to the relevant matter, any other third party professional firm which is
regularly engaged in providing valuations of businesses or assets similar or
comparable to those subject to the relevant Transaction Security (a “Financial
_Adviser”) in respect of which the Primary Creditors (other than the Operating_
Facility Lenders) are entitled to participate; or

(ii) where a Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an
opinion in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received in
connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view, taking into account
all relevant circumstances, including the method of enforcement, provided that
the liability of such Financial Adviser may be limited to the amount of its fees
in respect of such engagement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent
shall have no obligation to select or engage any Financial Adviser unless it
shall have been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its
satisfaction).

_Fair Value Protections—Second Lien Secured Creditors_

If prior to the Second Lien Discharge Date a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that any Second
Lien Liabilities will be released or disposed of, or any Transaction Security securing the Second Lien
Liabilities will be released, it is a further condition to the release that either:

(a) each Second Lien Creditor Representative has approved the release; or

(b) where shares or assets of a Second Lien Borrower or a Second Lien Guarantor are sold:

(i) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash); and

(ii) all claims of the First Lien Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders (other
than in relation to performance bonds or guarantees or similar instruments)
against a member of the Senior Secured Group (if any) all of whose shares
(other than any minority interest not owned by members of the Senior Secured
Group) are sold or disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are


-----

unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently
with such sale (and are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates)
and all Security under the Security Documents in respect of the assets that are
sold or disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally released and
discharged concurrently with such sale, _provided that if each of the Senior_
Secured Agents (acting reasonably and in good faith):

(A) determines that the Senior Secured Creditors will recover a greater
amount if any such claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the
purchaser or one of its affiliates and not released and discharged; and

(B) serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same,

the Security Agent shall be entitled to sell or otherwise transfer such claim to the purchaser or one of
its affiliates; and

(iii) such sale or disposal is made:

(A) pursuant to a Public Auction in respect of which the Primary Creditors
(other than the Operating Facility Lenders) are entitled to participate;
or

(B) here a Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered
an opinion in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received
in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view, taking
into account all relevant circumstances, including the method of
enforcement, provided that the liability of such Financial Adviser may
be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement (it
being acknowledged that the Security Agent shall have no obligation
to select or engage any Financial Adviser unless it shall have been
indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

For the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, “entitled to participate” shall be interpreted to mean
that any offer, or indication of a potential offer, that a holder of any Senior Secured Liabilities, Second
Lien Liabilities or Senior Parent Liabilities makes shall be considered by those running the Public
Auction against the same criteria as any offer, or indication of a potential offer, by any other bidder or
potential bidder. For the avoidance of doubt, if, after having applied those same criteria, the offer or
indication of a potential offer made by a holder of any Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien
Liabilities or Senior Parent Liabilities is not considered by those running the Public Auction to be
sufficient to continue in the sale process, such consideration being against the same criteria as any offer,
or indication of a potential offer, by any other bidder or potential bidder (such continuation may include
being invited to review additional information or being invited to have an opportunity to make a
subsequent or revised offer, whether in another round of bidding or otherwise), then the right to
participate which a holder of any Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Senior Parent
Liabilities under the Intercreditor Agreement shall be deemed to be satisfied.

_Fair Value Protections—Senior Parent Creditors_

If prior to the Senior Parent Discharge Date a Distressed Disposal is being effected such that the
guarantees of any Senior Parent Liabilities or any Shared Security over assets of a Senior Parent Debt
Issuer or assets of or shares in any Senior Parent Guarantor will be released and/or any Senior Parent
Liabilities will be released or disposed of, it is a further condition to the release that either:

(a) each Senior Parent Agent has approved the release; or

(b) where shares or assets of a Senior Parent Guarantor or assets of a Senior Parent Debt
Issuer are sold:


-----

(i) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash); and

(ii) all claims of the Senior Secured Creditors and the Operating Facility Lenders
(other than in relation to performance bonds or guarantees or similar
instruments) against a member of the Senior Secured Group (if any) all of
whose shares (other than any minority interest not owned by members of the
Senior Secured Group) are sold or disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement
Action, are unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of
concurrently with such sale (and are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its
affiliates) and all Security under the Transaction Security Documents in respect
of the assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally
released and discharged concurrently with such sale, _provided that if each_
Senior Agent (acting reasonably and in good faith):

(A) determines that the Senior Secured Creditors will recover a greater
amount if any such claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the
purchaser or one of its affiliates and not released and discharged; and

(B) serves a written notice on the Security Agent confirming the same, the
Security Agent shall be entitled to sell or otherwise transfer such claim
to the purchaser or one of its affiliates; and

(iii) such sale or disposal is made:

(A) pursuant to a Public Auction in respect of which the Primary Creditors
(other than the Operating Facility Lenders) are entitled to participate;
or

(B) where a Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered
an opinion in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received
in connection therewith is fair from a financial point of view, taking
into account all relevant circumstances, including the method of
enforcement, provided that the liability of such Financial Adviser may
be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement (it
being acknowledged that the Security Agent shall have no obligation
to select or engage any Financial Adviser unless it shall have been
indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

**_Adjustment of Mandatory Prepayments_**

If the making of any mandatory prepayment by any member of the Senior Secured Group in respect of
any of the Senior Secured Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities, the Senior Parent Liabilities and/or
the Operating Facility Liabilities (an “Original Mandatory Prepayment”) would directly or indirectly
result in a payment (a “Hedge Reduction Payment”) being made to any Hedge Counterparty as a
consequence of any close out or termination (in whole or in part) which is intended to ensure that the
maximum aggregate notional amount of any hedging does not exceed the maximum aggregate amount
of any indebtedness or the exposure the subject of that hedging, if elected by the Company, the
maximum aggregate amount of the mandatory prepayment required to be made by the Senior Secured
Group will be reduced so that the aggregate of (i) the amount of the reduced mandatory prepayment
and (ii) each Hedge Reduction Payment which would result from that reduced mandatory payment, is
equal to the amount of the Original Mandatory Prepayment.

**_Equalization_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that if, for any reason, any Secured Liabilities remain unpaid
after the first date on which certain types of Enforcement Action are taken (the “Enforcement _Date”)_
and the resulting losses are not borne by the creditors in any given specified class in the proportions
which their respective exposures at the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the
creditors in that specified class at the Enforcement Date, the relevant class of creditors will make such
payments amongst themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the relevant creditors in such a
position that (after taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions (or,
as the case may be, to otherwise reflect the order of priority described above under “—Application of
_Proceeds”)._

**_Amendments and Waivers_**

_Required Consents_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended or
waived only with the consent of the Company, the Investors and the Security Agent; and, to the extent
prohibited under the applicable Debt Financing Agreement, the agents and trustees for the Secured
Parties under that Debt Financing Agreement, provided that, to the extent that an amendment, waiver
or consent only affects only creditors under a particular Debt Financing Agreement and such


-----

amendment, waiver or consent does not reasonably be expected materially or adversely to affect the
interests of the other creditors, only written agreement from the agent or trustee acting on behalf of the
affected creditors shall be required.

Notwithstanding the above, certain of the provisions set out below under “—Existing 2026 Notes” shall
not be amended or waived without the consent of the Existing 2026 Notes Trustee.

_Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents_

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent may, if authorised
by an Instructing Group or the Majority Senior Parent Creditors (as applicable), and if the Company
consents, amend the terms of, waive any of the requirements of or grant consents under, any of the
Transaction Security Documents or Senior Parent Independent Transaction Security Documents (as
applicable) which shall be binding on each party to the Intercreditor Agreement.

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, in case of any amendment or waiver
of, or consent under, any Transaction Security Document or Senior Parent Independent Transaction
Security Document (as applicable) which would adversely affect the nature or scope of the assets subject
to the Transaction Security or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction
Security or Senior Parent Independent Transaction Security are distributed, that amendment, waiver or
consent shall require approval in accordance with the provisions described above under “—Required
_Consents.”_

_Exceptions_

Subject to the paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which adversely relates to the express
rights or obligations of an Agent, an arranger or co manager under the Debt Documents or the Security
Agent (in each case in such capacity) may not be effected without the consent of that Agent, that
arranger, that co-manager or the Security Agent (as the case may be) at such time.

The preceding paragraph and the paragraphs above under “—Amendments and Waivers—Transaction
_Security Documents” are subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, relating in_
particular to (i) any release of Transaction Security, or Senior Parent Independent Transaction Security,
claim or liabilities, or (ii) to any consent, which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance
with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the enforcement of Senior Parent
Independent Transaction Security.

Any term of the Intercreditor Agreement or a Transaction Security Document or Senior Parent
Independent Transaction Security Document may be amended or waived by the Company and the
Security Agent without the consent of any other party to the Intercreditor Agreement if that amendment
or waiver is (i) to cure defects or omissions, resolve ambiguities or inconsistencies or reflect changes
of a minor, technical or administrative nature or (ii) otherwise for the benefit of all or any of the Secured
Parties.

**_Senior Parent Administrative Consents_**

If the Senior Secured Creditors (or the requisite Senior Secured Creditors) at any time give any consent
in relation to any of the Senior Debt Documents of a minor, technical or administrative nature which
does not adversely affect the interests of the Senior Parent Creditors or change the commercial terms
contained in the Senior Parent Finance Documents then, if that action was approved by the Company
and permitted by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Parent Creditors will (or will be
deemed to) (a) give a corresponding Consent in equivalent terms in relation to each of the Secured Debt
Documents to which they are a party and (b) do anything (including executing any document) that the
Security Agent and the Company may reasonably require by written notice to give effect to this
provision.


-----

**_Agreement to Override_**

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement will
override anything in the Debt Documents to the contrary.

**_Governing Law_**

The Intercreditor Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it
are governed by English law, except for certain provisions relating to the appointment of the Security
Agent in respect of certain Transaction Security governed by German law, which provisions are
governed by German law.

**Hedging Agreements**

We currently maintain certain derivatives, including interest rate swaps and caps to manage our
exposure to interest rate movements on our financial debt. The valuation of our interest rate and foreign
exchange hedges as of 1 April 2023 was £31 million, with £34 million of assets and £3 million of
liabilities.

**Lease Liabilities**

We reported £1,556 million of lease liabilities as non-current liabilities and £41 million of lease
liabilities as current liabilities as of 1 April 2023. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contractual Commitments.”_

**Sale and Leaseback Transactions**

In July 2007, we entered into sale and leaseback arrangements with the predecessor in title of Secure
Income REIT plc in respect of substantially all land, buildings and rides at Alton Towers Resort, HeidePark Resort, Madame Tussauds London, THORPE PARK and Warwick Castle. Secure Income REIT
plc subsequently sold the freehold of Madame Tussauds to Fubon MTL Property (Jersey) Ltd. with no
changes to the terms of the lease. As a result of this arrangement, we have paid rent for these Attractions
during the periods under review.

In May 2012, we sold the LEGOLAND Windsor Hotel for £19 million to Richie Properties in a sale
and leaseback transaction, resulting in rent being payable on this site. The term of the lease is 35 years
with the option, but not the contractual requirement, to extend the lease agreement for two further terms
of 35 years, subject to an adjustment to market rates at the time of renewal. The lease for LEGOLAND
Windsor Hotel was subsequently transferred to Aberdeen Standard Investments.

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

Certain terms used in this description are defined under the subheading “—Certain Definitions.” In this
“Description of Notes,” (1) the term “Issuer” refers only to Motion Finco S.à r.l. a _société à_
_responsabilité limitée incorporated under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, having its_
registered office at 2-4, rue Eugène Ruppert, L-2453 Luxembourg and registered with the Luxembourg
Trade and Companies Register (Registre du Commerce et des Sociétés, Luxembourg) under number
B234977, and any successor obligor to Motion Finco S.à r.l. in respect of the Notes, and not to any of
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, and (2) the term “Company” refers only to Motion Acquisition Limited, a
private company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, and any
successor obligor to Motion Acquisition Limited in respect of its guarantee of the Notes, and not to any
of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates. The terms the “Group,” “we,” “our,” and “us” each refer to the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries.

The following is a description of the €650.0 million in aggregate principal amount of % senior
secured notes due 2030 (the “Notes”), offered hereby. The Notes will be issued by the Issuer under an
indenture (the “Indenture”) to be dated as of the Issue Date, between, among others, the Issuer, the
Guarantors and Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”) and Deutsche Bank AG,
London Branch (the “Security Agent”), in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration
requirements of the Securities Act (the “Offering”). See “Notice to Investors.” The terms of the Notes
will include those stated in the Indenture. The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner
of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will have rights under the Indenture, including, without
limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Indenture will not be
qualified under, incorporate provisions by reference to, or otherwise be subject, to the U.S. Trust
Indenture Act of 1939 (as amended).

On or about the Issue Date (as defined below), the proceeds of the Offering will be used, together with
cash on balance sheet, to redeem the Issuer’s €500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7% Senior
Secured Notes due 2025 (the “Existing 2025 Notes”), including to pay the redemption premium thereon
and accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption, to maintain cash on balance sheet to repay,
redeem, repurchase (including from the open-market) or address maturities of, our other secured
indebtedness and to pay the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Offering. See “Use of
_Proceeds.”_

Upon the issuance of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Notes will be senior secured obligations of the
Issuer. On the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Company (the
“Parent Guarantor” and such guarantee, the “Parent Guarantee”) and the Subsidiary Guarantors (as
defined herein) (together with the Parent Guarantor, the “Guarantors” and such guarantees, the
“Guarantees”). As further described in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of
_Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries,” in the future, certain additional Restricted Subsidiaries of the_
Company (other than the Issuer) that guarantee certain Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor will
be required to guarantee the Notes, subject to certain exceptions and subject to release and discharge as
described in this “Description of Notes.”

Within 30 days from the Issue Date, the Notes and the Guarantees will be secured on a first priority
basis, by the Senior Security (as defined herein). As described further in “—Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”, the Senior Security also secures the Existing 2026_
Notes, the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations on a first priority basis. The Notes will rank
pari passu with the Existing 2026 Notes, the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations. The Notes
and the Guarantees will be further secured on a first priority basis by the Shared Collateral (as defined
herein). As described further in “—Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement”, the Shared Collateral also secures the Existing 2026 Notes, the Senior Facilities and certain_
hedging obligations on a first priority basis and the Existing Senior Notes on a second priority basis.


-----

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below), and in the case of certain conflicts between the terms of
the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail.
The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of
indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, the procedures
for undertaking enforcement action, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security
Agent. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a
description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Issuer is a direct subsidiary of the Company and was incorporated for purposes of facilitating the
Acquisition and performing certain activities related thereto. The Issuer has no material assets, other
than equity interests in, and/or intercompany balances with, other subsidiaries or affiliates of the Group.
The Issuer has no revenue generating activities of its own and no business operations. Therefore, after
the Issue Date, the Issuer will depend on the receipt of funds from Lux Finco 2 pursuant to the
Luxembourg Proceeds Loan (as defined herein). Lux Finco 2 is a direct subsidiary of the Issuer and was
incorporated for purposes of facilitating the Acquisition and performing certain activities related
thereto. Lux Finco 2’s only material assets are its receivables under the UK Proceeds Loan (as defined
herein). Lux Finco 2 has no revenue generating activities of its own and no business operations.
Therefore, after the Issue Date, Lux Finco 2 will depend on the receipt of funds from the Company
(including payments made under a proceeds loan). The Company in turn, will depend on receipt of
funds from its Subsidiaries (whether in the form of dividends, other distributions, return on capital or
payments with respect to intercompany obligations) to meet its obligations, including, its obligations
under the Notes. The Notes will be structurally subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and
other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Company’s
Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors or the Issuer.

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Notes, and refers to the
Intercreditor Agreement and the other Security Documents. This description does not purport to be
complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all provisions of the Indenture,
the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the other Security Documents, respectively. Because this
description is a summary, it may not contain all the information that is important to you. You should
read the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the other Security Documents in their
entirety.

**General**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will be general obligations of the Issuer and will:

- rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing or future obligations that are
not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the Issuer’s guarantee of the
Existing 2026 Notes and its obligations under the Senior Facilities and certain hedging
obligations;

- rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the Issuer’s obligations under
its guarantee of the Existing Senior Notes;

- be effectively subordinated to all existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are secured
by property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property
and assets securing such obligations;

- be structurally subordinated to all obligations of the Company’s subsidiaries that do not
guarantee the Notes (other than the Issuer);


-----

- be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Guarantors, subject to limitations under applicable law
as set forth below under the caption “—Guarantees;” and

- be secured as set forth below under “—Security.”

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Liens,” the Notes will permit and subject to repayment of the term facilities under the_
Senior Facilities Agreement (or receipt of consent thereunder), the Senior Facilities will permit certain
credit facility Indebtedness and certain Hedging Obligations to have priority with respect to the receipt
of proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral and certain distressed disposals in priority to Holders
of the Notes pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**_The Guarantees_**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors.

The Guarantees will be general obligations of the Guarantors and will:

- rank _pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior obligations of that_
Guarantor that are not subordinated in right of payment to the Guarantee (including such
Guarantor’s obligations under the Existing 2026 Notes, the Senior Facilities and certain
hedging obligations);

- rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future obligations of that Guarantor that are
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Guarantee (including such Guarantor’s
obligations under its guarantee of the Existing Senior Notes);

- be effectively subordinated to all existing and future obligations of that Guarantor that are
secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes to the extent of the value of the
property and assets securing such obligations;

- be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of the Subsidiaries of the
Guarantor that do not guarantee or issue the Notes; and

- be secured as set forth below under “—Security.”

The obligations of the Guarantors will be contractually limited under the applicable Guarantees to
reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit,
fraudulent conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective
shareholders, directors and general partners. For a description of such limitations, see “Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital_
_maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the_
_validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral” and “Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security.”_

During the 53 weeks ended 1 April 2023, the Guarantors accounted for 79 per cent. of the consolidated
revenue and 81 per cent. of the consolidated EBITDA of the Group, and as of 1 April 2023, the
Guarantors accounted for 63 per cent. of the consolidated assets (excluding brand values, goodwill,
minority equity investments and investments in wholly owned subsidiaries) of the Group. As of April
1, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, the
Issuer and the Guarantors would have had £3,268 million (equivalent) in total aggregate principal
amount of senior secured indebtedness outstanding, consisting of £2,371 million (equivalent) of
borrowings under the Senior Facilities, £325 million (equivalent) of the Existing 2026 Notes and £572
million (equivalent) of the Notes.


-----

**Principal and Maturity**

The Issuer will issue an aggregate principal amount of €650.0 million of Notes on the Issue Date. The
Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof. The Notes will constitute separate series of Notes under the Indenture but, except as
otherwise provided herein, will be treated as a single class with each other series of Notes issued under
the Indenture for all purposes under the Indenture, including for purposes of voting and taking all other
actions permitted by Holders of the Notes. The Notes will mature on, 2030; provided that if any
Existing Senior Notes remain outstanding on 15 August 2027, the Notes will mature on 15 August 2027
(the “Maturity Date”). On the Maturity Date, the outstanding principal amount of the Notes will be due
and payable, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, at par.

The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive the payments on such Notes are
subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect
of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder
thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at
such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of such delay.

**Interest**

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of   % per annum. Interest on the Notes will be payable
semi-annually in arrears on each    and   , commencing   , 2023, to the Holders of record on the
Business Day immediately preceding the applicable interest payment date. Interest on the Notes will
accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from
and including the Issue Date. Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360 day year
comprised of twelve 30 day months. Each interest period will end on (but not include) the relevant
interest payment date. The interest amount will be calculated by applying the applicable rate to the
aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Notes.

**Additional Notes**

From time to time, subject to the Issuer’s compliance with the covenants described under the headings
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock
_and Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens,” the Issuer is permitted to issue additional_
Notes (“Additional Notes”), which shall have terms substantially identical to the Notes, respectively,
except in respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate, or at
the election of the Issuer in its sole discretion, a supplemental indenture, delivered by the Issuer to the
Trustee:

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued and will mature;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear
interest and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such
interest rate or rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment
dates on which such interest shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be
determined, the record dates for the determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is
payable and the basis upon which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the
currency in which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional
Notes may be payable;


-----

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms
and conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000, in excess
thereof, in respect of the Additional Notes, the denominations in which such Additional Notes
shall be issued and redeemed;

(8) the ISIN, Common Code or other securities identification numbers with respect to such
Additional Notes;

(9) to reflect a change in tax law since the date of the Indenture in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(as defined below under “—Withholding Taxes”); and

(10) any relevant limitation language with respect to Guarantees and Security Documents.

Such Additional Notes will be treated, along with all other Notes, as a single class for the purposes of
the Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically
distinguished for such series. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture
and this “Description of Notes,” references to “Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the
Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Notes.

In order for any Additional Notes to have the same ISIN or Common Code, as applicable, as the Notes,
such Additional Notes must be fungible with the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

Principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes will be payable at the
office or agency of the Issuer maintained for such purpose (the “Paying Agent”) or, at the option of the
Issuer, cash payment of principal, premium, if any, interest and Additional Amounts on the Notes may
be made through the applicable paying agent by check mailed to the Holders of the Notes at their
respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders; provided that (i) all cash payments of principal,
premium, if any, and interest with respect to the Notes represented by one or more global notes
registered in the name of or held by the common depositary of Euroclear and Clearstream or its nominee
will be made through the Paying Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts
specified by the registered Holder or Holders thereof and (ii) all cash payments of principal, premium,
if any, and interest with respect to certificated Notes may, at the option of the Issuer, be made by wire
transfer to a euro account maintained by the payee with a bank in the United Kingdom or Europe if the
applicable Holder elects payment by wire transfer by giving written notice to the Trustee or the Paying
Agent to such effect designating such account no later than 30 days immediately preceding the relevant
due date for payment (or such other date as the Trustee may accept in its discretion).

**Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents for the Notes. The initial Paying Agent for the Notes
will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch.

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (the “Registrar”) and transfer agents for the Notes.
The initial Registrar will be Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas and the transfer agent (the
“Transfer Agent”) will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch. The Registrar will maintain a register
reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to time. The Paying Agent will make payments
on, and the Transfer Agent will facilitate transfer of, the Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

The Issuer may change any paying agent, registrar or transfer agent without prior notice to the Holders.
The Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act as a paying agent, registrar or transfer agent in respect
of the Notes. For so long as the Notes are listed, and dealings in the Notes are permitted on the Official
List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”), the Issuer will satisfy any requirement of


-----

such exchange as to paying agents, registrars and transfer agents and will comply with any notice
requirements required under the International Stock Exchange Authority Limited’s listing rules in
connection with any change of paying agent, registrar or transfer agent.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar and the
Trustee may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection
with a transfer of Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. The Issuer and the
applicable transfer agent will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption
or tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of Control Offer or an
Asset Sale Offer (each as defined herein). Also, the Issuer and the applicable transfer agent will not be
required to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before the delivery of a notice of
redemption of Notes to be redeemed or between record date and payment date. The registered Holder
of a Note will be treated as the owner of the Note for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

As of the Issue Date, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” of the
Company for the purposes of the Indenture. In the circumstances described below under “—Certain
_Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Company will be permitted to designate Restricted_
Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be
subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.

**The Proceeds Loans**

On April 29, 2020, the Issuer on-lent the proceeds of the Existing 2025 Notes to Lux Motion Finco 2
S.à r.l. a _société à responsabilité limitée incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg, having its_
registered office at 2-4, rue Eugène Ruppert, L-2453 Luxembourg and registered with the Luxembourg
Trade and Companies Register (Registre du Commerce et des Sociétés, Luxembourg) under number
B235038 (“Lux Finco 2”) (the “Luxembourg Proceeds Loan”) and Lux Finco 2 further on lent the
proceeds of the Existing 2025 Notes to the Company (the “UK Proceeds Loan” and together with the
Luxembourg Proceeds Loan, the “Proceeds Loans”) under the proceeds loan agreements and/or loan
note instruments (the “Proceeds Loan Agreements”). The Proceeds Loans are in a total aggregate
principal amount of €500 million. The Proceeds Loan Agreements will be repaid, amended or replaced,
on or about the Issue Date, to provide that Lux Finco 2 will pay to the Issuer, interest and principal in
an amount sufficient to pay amounts due under the Notes as well as any Additional Amounts due
thereunder on a timely basis in order to ensure that the Issuer can satisfy its payment obligations under
the Notes and the Indenture. The Proceeds Loans will be repaid, amended or replaced on the date on
which the Notes are repaid, prepaid, redeemed, repurchased or defeased, and the Company and Lux
Finco 2 may at any time prepay the Proceeds Loans, including in connection with any proposed
repayment, prepayment, redemption, repurchase or defeasance of the Notes.

The Proceeds Loans are, or will be, assigned by way of security to the Security Agent for the benefit of
the Holders and other secured parties, including the creditors under the Senior Facilities and the Existing
2026 Notes.

**Guarantees**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors. As further
described in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted
_Subsidiaries,” in the future, certain additional Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company (other than the_
Issuer) that guarantee certain Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor will be required to guarantee
the Notes, subject to certain exceptions and subject to release and discharge as described in this
“Description of Notes.”


-----

Guarantees granted by the Guarantors will also benefit the Senior Facilities and the Existing 2026 Notes
on a senior basis and the Existing Senior Notes on a senior subordinated basis. The Indenture will limit
the obligation to grant guarantees in favour of obligations under the Notes. The Indenture will include
restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by
general statutory limitations, financial assistance, capital maintenance, corporate benefit, fraudulent
preference, thin capitalization rules, retention of title claims and similar principles. The obligations of
the Guarantors will be contractually limited under the applicable Guarantees to reflect these limitations
and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and
general partners. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our_
_Structure—Insolvency laws and other limitations on the Guarantees, including fraudulent conveyance_
_statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.”_

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the
Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. This provision may not,
however, be effective to protect a Guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may
reduce the applicable Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its Guarantee
worthless. If a Guarantee was rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other
indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending
on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability in respect of its Guarantee could be reduced
to zero. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—Corporate benefit, financial
_assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may_
_adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral.”_

In addition, as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of
_Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed_
Security Principles and limitations described in the immediately preceding paragraph, each Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company (other than the Issuer) that in the future guarantees the Senior Facilities, the
Existing 2026 Notes, the Existing Senior Notes or certain other Indebtedness shall also enter into a
supplemental indenture as a Guarantor to grant a senior secured guarantee of the Notes and accede to
the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favour of obligations
under the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees
where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory limitations, regulatory
requirements or restrictions, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance rules, liquidity
protection rules, fraudulent preference, “earnings stripping,” “controlled foreign corporation,” “thin
capitalization” rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval
requirements and similar principles. Each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would
not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance
provisions of applicable law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles to comply
with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s
obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the
Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes and Our Structure—Insolvency laws and other limitations on the Guarantees,_
_including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability” and_
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—Enforcing your rights as a holder of the
_Notes or under the guarantees or in the Collateral across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult.” See_
“Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the
_Guarantees and Security.”_

Each Guarantee by a Guarantor will provide by its terms that it will be automatically and
unconditionally released and discharged upon:


-----

(1) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, any sale, exchange, issuance, disposition or transfer (by
merger, amalgamation, consolidation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital
Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor, after which the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor is no
longer a Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) all or substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary
Guarantor, in each case if such sale, exchange, issuance, disposition or transfer is made in
compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture (including any amendments
thereof);

(2) the release or discharge of the guarantee by, or direct obligation of, such Guarantor of
Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities, the Existing 2026 Notes and the Existing Senior Notes,
or the release or discharge of such other guarantee or direct obligation that resulted in the
creation of such Guarantee, except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under
such guarantee or direct obligation (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent
reinstatement will constitute a release for the purposes of this provision, and that if any such
Guarantee is so reinstated, such Guarantee shall also be reinstated to the extent that such
Guarantor would then be required to provide a Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted
_Subsidiaries”);_

(3) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a
Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable
provisions of the Indenture or the occurrence of any event following which the Subsidiary
Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of
the Indenture;

(4) upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Issuer or
another Guarantor or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor, in each case, in compliance with
the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(5) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event (as
defined herein);

(6) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver”;

(7) the exercise by the Issuer of its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as
described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the discharge of the
Issuer’s obligations under the Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(8) in the case of the Company, if the Company ceases to be the direct parent of the Issuer, subject
to the assumption of all of the obligations of the Company under the Indenture, in each case,
pursuant to supplemental indentures or other applicable documents or instruments by the entity
that directly owns 100% of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests in the Issuer pursuant to
the definition thereof;

(9) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

(10) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, by written notice from the Issuer to the Trustee upon the
Notes achieving an Investment Grade Rating; or

(11) in the case only of the Parent Guarantee, pursuant to the provisions described below under “—
_IPO Pushdown.”_

Notwithstanding clause (5) above, if, after any Covenant Suspension Event, a Reversion Date (as
defined herein) shall occur, then the Suspension Period (as defined herein) with respect to such


-----

Covenant Suspension Event shall terminate and all actions reasonably necessary to provide that the
Notes shall have been unconditionally guaranteed by each Guarantor (to the extent such guarantee is
required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of
_Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”) shall be taken within 30 days after such Reversion Date or as_
soon as reasonably practicable thereafter.

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Guarantee, as specified above, the Trustee, subject to
receipt of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will execute any documents delivered to it by the
Issuer in order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and termination in respect of such
Guarantee. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the
Notes to reflect any such release, discharge or termination.

Substantially all the operations of the Company and the Issuer are conducted through Subsidiaries of
the Company. Claims of creditors of Subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Guarantors, including trade
creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and
claims of preferred shareholders and minority shareholders of those Subsidiaries generally will have
priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the
Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders. The Notes and each Guarantee therefore will be
effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors), preferred shareholders and minority
shareholders of Subsidiaries of the Company other than the Issuer and the Guarantors. Although the
Indenture will limit the incurrence of indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of the
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company, the limitations will be subject to a number
of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the incurrence by
such Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of
_Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.”_

**Security**

**_The Collateral_**

Within 30 days from the Issue Date, the Notes and the Guarantees will be secured, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, on a first priority basis, by:

- a share charge granted by Motion Midco Limited (“Midco”) over its shares in the capital of the
Company and an assignment of material structural intercompany receivables owed by the
Company to Midco (together, the “Shared Collateral”); and

the following security interests:

- security over the shares in the capital of the Issuer and each Subsidiary Guarantor (other than
Gardaland S.r.l.);

- security over the material bank accounts (if any) of the Company, the Issuer, Lux Finco 2 and
the Motion Finco LLC (“U.S. Co Borrower”) (in each case, without control over use);

- an assignment of material, structural intercompany receivables owed by the Company to Lux
Finco 2;

- a pledge of material, structural intercompany receivables owed by Lux Finco 2 to the Issuer;

- a floating charge over the business and assets of the Company; and

- security interests over the assets of each Subsidiary Guarantor that is incorporated or organized
under the laws of the United States or any state thereof (or the District of Columbia) (A) which
are located in the United States or any state thereof (including the District of Columbia) and


-----

(B) over which security interests are capable of being registered and perfected solely by
customary UCC 1 filings in its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation (collectively, the
“Senior Security”, and together with the Shared Collateral and any and all assets from time to
time in which a security interest has been or will be granted pursuant to any Security Document
to secure the obligations under the Indenture or the Notes or any Guarantee, in each case as
may be in existence from time to time, the “Collateral”).

As described further in “—Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”,
the Senior Security also secures the liabilities in respect of the Existing 2026 Notes, the Senior Facilities
Agreement and certain hedging obligations. The Notes will rank pari passu with the Existing 2026
Notes, the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations with respect to the right to receive proceeds
from the enforcement of the Senior Security. As described further in “—Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”, the Shared Collateral also secures the liabilities_
in respect of the Existing 2026 Notes, the Senior Facilities, certain hedging obligations on a first-priority
basis and the Existing Senior Notes on a second-priority basis. The Notes will rank pari passu with the
Existing 2026 Notes, the Senior Facilities and certain hedging obligations, and in priority to the Existing
Senior Notes, with respect to the right to receive proceeds from an enforcement of the Shared Collateral.

The Agreed Security Principles embody recognition by all parties that there may be certain legal and
practical difficulties in obtaining guarantees and security from the Issuer and all Guarantors in every
jurisdiction in which the Issuer and the Guarantors are located. In particular:

- general legal and statutory limitations (including, but not limited to, with respect to the relevant
jurisdictions for which guarantee limitation language is set out in the Indenture, such limitations
as set out therein), financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin
capitalization”, “earnings stripping”, “controlled foreign corporation”, “capital maintenance”
and “liquidity impairment” rules, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval
requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of the Parent and its Restricted
Subsidiaries to provide a guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or security be
limited by an amount or otherwise;

- the Liens over the Collateral and extent of their perfection will be agreed taking into account
the cost to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of providing such security (including
any increase to the tax and/or regulatory costs of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries)
so as to ensure that it is proportionate to the benefit accruing to the Noteholders and the
maximum guaranteed or secured amount may be limited to minimize stamp duty, notarization,
registration or other applicable fees, taxes and duties where the benefit of increasing the
guaranteed or secured amount is disproportionate to the level of such fee, taxes and duties;

- any assets subject to third party arrangements which are permitted by the Indenture and which
prevent those assets from being charged, and any cash constituting regulatory capital or
customer cash, will be excluded from the Collateral;

- the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be required to give guarantees or enter
into security documents if: (1) other than in the case of the Issuer, they are not incorporated in
Australia, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the
United States or a jurisdiction of a borrower under the Senior Facilities Agreement (each a
“Security Jurisdiction”), (2) in the good faith judgment of the directors of the Company, the
creation of security and/or the giving of a guarantee could materially adversely affect the
solvency capital requirements, of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to
any applicable law or regulation, (3) if it would conflict with the fiduciary duties of their
directors or managers, or (4) contravene any legal, contractual or regulatory prohibition or result
in a risk of personal or criminal liability on the part of any officer;

- if there are third party arrangements in place in respect of any asset, business or entity acquired
by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (where those third party arrangements were not


-----

entered into in contemplation of that acquisition) as a result of which the consent of a third
party is required for that acquired entity to provide a guarantee or to secure any acquired asset,
such guarantee and/or security will not be required to be granted;

- the granting or perfection of Liens over the Collateral will not be required if it would have a
material adverse effect on the ability of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to
conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course or as otherwise permitted by the
Indenture and the related finance documents (including, without limitation, notification of such
security to any third party);

- no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions that are not Security Jurisdictions; and

- the maximum guaranteed or secured amount may be limited to minimize stamp duty,
notarization, registration or other applicable fees, taxes and duties.

The Agreed Security Principles with respect to the Notes will be interpreted and applied in good faith
by the Issuer.

The guarantee granted by the Guarantors and security over the Collateral will be limited as necessary
to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed by local law and defenses generally available
to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws,
regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under
applicable law. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security.”_

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens,” the Company is_
permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of its Indebtedness
or Indebtedness of its Restricted Subsidiaries, including any Additional Notes, in each case, as permitted
under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Administration of Security and Enforcement of Liens_**

The Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent under the Security Documents, pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement, for the benefit of all holders of secured obligations. The enforcement of the
Security Documents will be subject to the procedures set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. For a
description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The ability of Holders of the Notes to realize the Collateral will be subject to various bankruptcy law
limitations in the event of the Issuer’s, a Guarantor’s or the relevant Collateral grantor’s or provider’s
bankruptcy. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—The security interests
_in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes._
_The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law” and “Certain_
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees_
_and Security.”_

In addition, the enforcement of the Collateral may be limited to the maximum amount permitted under
applicable law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. As a result of these
limitations, the enforceable amounts of the Issuer’s obligation under the Notes and a Guarantor’s
obligations under its Guarantee could be significantly less than the total amounts payable with respect
to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See “Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees_
_and Security.”_


-----

The Security Documents will be entered into by the relevant security provider and the Security Agent
to the extent permitted by applicable laws. The relevant Security Documents or the Intercreditor
Agreement may provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favour of the Security Agent,
and certain security interests in such jurisdictions may secure the parallel debt (and not the Indebtedness
under the Notes, the Guarantees and the other secured obligations). See “Risk Factors—Risks Related
_to the Notes and Our Structure—The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security_
_Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the_
_Collateral may be restricted by local law” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations_
_on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security.” Subject to the terms of the Security_
Documents, the Issuer, the Guarantors and the other relevant providers or grantors of the Collateral will
have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes,
to freely operate the Collateral, to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom and, where
applicable, dispose of or use up assets that are Collateral, in each case until such time as the Collateral
is enforceable under the terms of the Security Documents.

No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer in connection
with the issuance of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of the
Collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders. By its nature, some or all
of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there
can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or at all.

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement places limitations on the ability of the Security Agent to cause
the sale of certain of the Collateral. These limitations may include requirements that some or all of the
Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to public auctions or only at a price confirmed by a valuation.
See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Trustee for the Notes has, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have:

- irrevocably appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement
and the other relevant documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the other
Security Documents);

- irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights and
powers that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or other documents
to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the other Security Documents), together
with any other incidental rights and powers; and (ii) execute each document, waiver,
modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security
Agent on its behalf; and

- accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below), and each Holder will also be deemed to have
authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents as between (a) the lenders under the Senior Facilities and other future indebtedness that is
secured by the Collateral, (b) the counterparties under certain hedging contracts, (c) the trustee and the
noteholders under the Existing 2026 Indenture, (d) the trustee and the noteholders under the Existing
Senior Notes Indenture, (e) the Trustee and Holders under the Indenture, and (f) the creditors of certain
other Indebtedness (including Indebtedness that may be Incurred in the future) permitted to be secured
by such Collateral, respectively, are established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, which
provides, among other things, that the obligations under the Senior Facilities, certain hedging
obligations, the Existing 2026 Notes and the Notes are secured equally and ratably by first priority
Security Interests in the Collateral and the Existing Senior Notes are secured by second priority Security


-----

Interests in the Shared Collateral; provided that subject to certain conditions, including compliance with
the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” certain credit facility
Indebtedness and certain hedging obligations may be designated as having super senior priority
pursuant to the operation of the Intercreditor Agreement, in which case, such super senior priority
Indebtedness will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Security Interests in the Collateral and
certain distressed disposals in priority to Holders of the Notes pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Release of Liens_**

The Security Agent will, upon written direction and reasonable request from the Company or the Issuer
and at the cost of the Company or the Issuer, take any action required to effectuate any release of
Collateral required by a Security Document:

(1) upon release of a Guarantee (with respect to the Liens over the property and assets, and Capital
Stock of such Guarantor) in accordance with the Indenture;

(2) in connection with any disposition of Collateral (with respect to the Lien on such Collateral),
directly or indirectly, to (a) any Person other than the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Certain Covenants—Merger,
_Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets”) or (b) the Company or any Restricted_
Subsidiary consistent with the Intercreditor Agreement, so long as the relevant Collateral
becomes subject to a substantially equivalent Lien in favour of the Security Agent securing the
Notes; provided that in the case of each of clauses (a) and (b), such disposition is permitted by
the Indenture;

(3) automatically without any action by the Trustee, if the Lien granted in favour of any
Indebtedness that gave rise to the obligation to grant the Lien over such Collateral pursuant to
the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Liens” is released (other than pursuant
to the repayment and discharge thereof); provided that such release would otherwise be
permitted by another clause above;

(4) in order to effectuate a merger, consolidation, conveyance or transfer conducted in compliance
with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of
_All or Substantially All Assets”;_

(5) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the Notes issued
under the Indenture or discharge or defeasance thereof in accordance with the Indenture;

(6) as otherwise provided in the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver”; or

(8) pursuant to the provisions described below under “—IPO Pushdown,” as specified in the
Indenture.

Subject to the receipt of certain certifications and opinions, each of these releases shall be effected by
the Security Agent and, to the extent required or necessary, the Trustee, without the consent of the
Holders.

The Issuer, Midco and the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may also, among other things,
without any release or consent by the Trustee or the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities
with respect to Collateral, including, without limitation, (i) selling or otherwise disposing of, in any
transaction or series of related transactions, any property subject to the Lien under the Security
Documents which has become worn out, defective or obsolete or not used or useful in the business; (ii)
selling, transferring, paying off or using up or otherwise disposing of current assets or intercompany


-----

receivables in the ordinary course of business; and (iii) any other action not prohibited by the Indenture,
the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

**IPO Pushdown**

(a) On, in contemplation of, or following a public equity offering (an “IPO Event”), the
Company shall be entitled to require (by written notice to the Trustee (a “Pushdown
_Notice”)) that the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement (or any_
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) shall operate (with effect from the date specified
in the relevant Pushdown Notice) on the basis that: (i) references to the Company and
Restricted Subsidiaries (and all related provisions) shall apply only to the IPO
Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries from time to time; (ii) all financial
ratio calculations, basket calculations and financial definitions shall exclude any
Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity and all reporting obligations shall be
assumed at the level of the IPO Pushdown Entity; (iii) each reference in the Indenture
or the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) to “the
_Company” shall be deemed to be a reference to the IPO Pushdown Entity (to the extent_
applicable and unless the context requires otherwise); and _provided,_ _further, that_
nothing in this paragraph, including the deeming construct contemplated by this sub
paragraph (iii) and any action related thereto taken by the IPO Pushdown Entity prior
to but in connection with it being deemed to be the Company, shall, or shall be deemed
to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any covenant or other term
in the Indenture or a Default or an Event of Default; (iv) none of the representations,
warranties, undertakings, covenants or Events of Default, as applicable, in the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the
other Security Documents shall apply to any entity of which the IPO Pushdown Entity
is a Subsidiary (whether in its capacity as a Guarantor in respect of the Notes or
otherwise); (v) no event, matter or circumstance relating to any Holding Company of
the IPO Pushdown Entity (whether in its capacity as a Guarantor or otherwise) shall,
or shall be deemed to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any
covenant or other term in the Indenture or a Default or an Event of Default; (vi) each
Holding Company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be irrevocably and
unconditionally released from all obligations under the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and any security granted by
any such Holding Company; (vii) unless otherwise notified by the Company: (A) each
Person which is party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) as an “Investor” (as such term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement)
shall be irrevocably and unconditionally released from the Intercreditor Agreement (or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and all obligations and restrictions under the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (and from the date
specified by the Company, that Person shall cease to be party to the Intercreditor
Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor and shall have
no further rights or obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) as an Investor); and (B) there shall be no obligation or
requirement for any Person to become party to the Intercreditor Agreement as an
Investor; and (viii) in the event that any Person is released from or does not become
party to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) as an
Investor as a consequence of this paragraph (a), any term of the Indenture and/or the
Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) which requires or
assumes that any Person be an Investor or that any liabilities or obligations to such
Person be subject to the Intercreditor Agreement (or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) or otherwise subordinated shall cease to apply. A Pushdown Notice may
not be delivered if a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
(disregarding any Default or Event of Default that could be deemed to arise in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this provision).


-----

(b) The Trustee, the Security Agent and any other agents party thereto shall be required to
enter into any amendment to the Indenture or amendment to or replacement of the
Intercreditor Agreement or the other Security Documents required by the Company in
writing and/or take such other action as is required by the Company in order to facilitate
or reflect any of the matters contemplated by the first paragraph of this covenant
(collectively, an “IPO Pushdown”); provided that such amendment or replacement will
not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee, the Security Agent and any other
agents party thereto or adversely affect the personal rights, protections, duties,
liabilities, indemnifications or immunities of the Trustee, the Security Agent or any
other agents party thereto under the Indenture, Intercreditor Agreement or Security
Documents. The Trustee, the Security Agent and any other agents party thereto are
each irrevocably authorized and instructed by the Holders of the Notes (without any
consent by the Holders of the Notes) to execute any such amended or replacement
documents and/or take other such action on behalf of the Holders (and shall do so on
the reasonable request of and at the cost of the Company).

(c) For the purpose of this covenant, the “IPO Pushdown Entity” shall be any Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company notified to the Trustee by the Company in writing as the
Person to be treated as the IPO Pushdown Entity in relation to the relevant IPO Event;
_provided that the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be a Restricted Subsidiary of the_
Company which will issue shares, or whose shares are to be sold, pursuant to that IPO
Event (or a Holding Company of such Restricted Subsidiary); provided, further, that
the Company may not designate the Issuer or a Subsidiary of MEL as the IPO
Pushdown Entity.

(d) If the Company delivers a Pushdown Notice to the Trustee pursuant to the first
paragraph of this covenant in relation to a contemplated IPO Event, it shall be entitled
to revoke that Pushdown Notice at any time prior to the occurrence of the relevant IPO
Event by written notice to the Trustee. In the event that any Pushdown Notice is
revoked in accordance with this paragraph (d): (i) the provisions of clauses (i) to (vii)
of the first paragraph of this covenant shall cease to apply in relation to that Pushdown
Notice; (ii) if any security has been released pursuant to paragraph (a) above in reliance
on that Pushdown Notice, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Company or
the relevant Restricted Subsidiary shall as soon as reasonably practicable execute a
replacement Security Document in respect of that security; and (iii) if any Person party
to the Intercreditor Agreement as an “Investor” has been released from the Intercreditor
Agreement pursuant to sub paragraph (a)(vii) above in reliance on that Pushdown
Notice, that Person shall as soon as reasonably practicable accede to the Intercreditor
Agreement as an Investor.

For the avoidance of doubt: (A) nothing in the immediately preceding paragraph shall prohibit or
otherwise restrict the Company from delivering a further Pushdown Notice in relation to any actual or
contemplated IPO Event; and (B) revocation of a Pushdown Notice shall not, and shall not be deemed
to, directly or indirectly constitute or result in a breach of any representation, warranty, undertaking or
other term in the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or a Default or an Event of Default (whether
by reason of any action or step taken by any Person, or any matter or circumstance arising or committed,
while that Pushdown Notice was effective or otherwise).

**Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

In connection with the incurrence of any Indebtedness by the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries that is permitted to share in the Collateral (and which the Company elects shall share in
the Collateral), the Trustee and the Security Agent shall, at the written request of the Company or the
Issuer, enter into with the Company, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries and the holders of such
Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) one or more intercreditor agreements or deeds
(including a restatement, replacement, amendment or other modification of the Intercreditor


-----

Agreement) (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”), on substantially the same terms as the
Intercreditor Agreement (or terms that are not materially less favourable to the Holders) and
substantially similar as applies to sharing of the proceeds of security and enforcement of security,
priority and release of security; provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose
any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or adversely affect the personal rights,
protections, duties, liabilities, indemnifications or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under
the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement. In connection with the foregoing, the Company or the
Issuer shall furnish to the Trustee and the Security Agent such documentation in relation thereto as they
may reasonably require. As used herein, a reference to the Intercreditor Agreement will also include
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

In relation to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the
payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any
obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply
with the covenant described herein under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture will also provide that, at the written direction of the Company or the Issuer and without
the consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or
more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or
inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any
such Intercreditor Agreement that may be incurred by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries that
is subject to any such Intercreditor Agreement (provided that such Indebtedness is incurred in
compliance with the Indenture), (3) add Guarantors or other Restricted Subsidiaries as third party
security providers to the Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including Additional
Notes), (5) make provision for pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes or to implement any
Permitted Liens or (6) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the
Holders of Notes in any material respect. The Company or the Issuer shall not otherwise direct the
Trustee or Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the
consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except
as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” or as permitted by the
terms of such Intercreditor Agreement, and the Company or the Issuer may only direct the Trustee or
Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal
obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent,
adversely affect their respective rights, protections, duties, liabilities, indemnifications or immunities
under the Indenture or any Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed
to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described
herein) and to have authorized the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement on each Holder’s behalf.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below, the Issuer will not be entitled to redeem the Notes at its option prior to,
2026. At any time prior to, 2026, the Issuer may, at its option and on one or more occasions,
redeem all or a part of the Notes, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the applicable Notes redeemed plus the
Applicable Premium as of, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of
redemption (the “Redemption Date”), subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the Redemption
Date.

At any time on and after, 2026, the Issuer may, at its option and on one or more occasions,
redeem all or a part of the Notes, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at the


-----

redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount of the applicable Notes to be
redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the
applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the Redemption Date, if
redeemed during the twelve month period beginning on of each of the years indicated below:

**Notes Redemption**

**Year** **Price**

2026 ..................................................................................................................................... %

2027 ..................................................................................................................................... %

2028 and thereafter .............................................................................................................. 100.000%

In addition, at any time prior to, 2026, the Issuer may, at its option and on one or more occasions,
redeem an aggregate principal amount of Notes not to exceed the Net Cash Proceeds received by the
Company from one or more Equity Offerings or a contribution to the Company’s common equity capital
made with the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings, upon notice as described under “—
_Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to_ % of the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date,
subject to the right of Holders of Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on
the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the Redemption Date; provided that:

(1) the amount redeemed shall not exceed 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
issued under the Indenture (including any Additional Notes);

(2) at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued under the Indenture
on the Issue Date remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such
redemption (unless all Notes are redeemed substantially concurrently); and

(3) each such redemption occurs within 180 days of the date of closing of the applicable Equity
Offering.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer, Change of Control Offer, Alternate
Offer (as defined herein) or Asset Sale Offer for one or more series of Notes, if Holders of not less than
90% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series validly tender and do
not validly withdraw such Notes in such offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such offer in
lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes of such series validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than
60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 60 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes
of such series that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to
each other Holder (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) in such offer (which may be less than
par) plus, to the extent not included in the offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon,
to, but excluding, the Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the Redemption
Date. In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes of a series have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes in a tender offer,
Change of Control Offer, Alternate Offer or Asset Sale Offer, as applicable, Notes owned by an Affiliate
of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof,
shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer, Change of Control Offer,
Alternate Offer or Asset Sale Offer, as applicable.

Notice of any redemption or offer to purchase, whether in connection with an Equity Offering, Change
of Control, Alternate Offer, Asset Sale Offer or other transaction or event or otherwise, may, at the
Issuer’s discretion, be given prior to the completion or occurrence thereof, and any such redemption,
offer to purchase or notice may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions
precedent, including, but not limited to, completion or occurrence of the related Equity Offering,


-----

Change of Control, Asset Sale or other transaction or event, as the case may be. The Issuer may redeem
Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in the Indenture, and a single notice of
redemption may be delivered with respect to redemptions made pursuant to different provisions. Any
such notice may provide that redemptions made pursuant to different provisions will have different
Redemption Dates. In addition, if such redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption or repurchase date may
be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption or offer
to purchase was sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole
discretion), or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the
event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole
discretion) by the redemption or purchase date, or by the redemption or purchase date so delayed, or
that such notice may be rescinded at any time in the Issuer’s sole discretion if the Issuer determines that
any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such
notice or offer to purchase that payment of the redemption or purchase price and performance of the
Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption or offer to purchase may be performed by another
Person.

The Issuer, the Company, its direct and indirect equityholders, including the Investors, any of its
Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and members of our management may acquire the Notes by
means other than a redemption, whether by tender offer, open market purchases, negotiated transactions
or otherwise. Certain Investors or their Affiliates are expected to invest in the Notes on the Issue Date.
See “Plan of Distribution—General—Other Relationships.”

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Issuer will not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payment with respect
to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase
Notes as described under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders.” As market conditions
warrant, we and our equity holders, including the Investors, their respective Affiliates and members of
our management, may from time to time seek to purchase our outstanding debt securities or loans,
including the Notes, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise.
Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, including
the Senior Facilities, the Existing 2026 Indenture, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture and the
Indenture, any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the
incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our credit facilities. The
amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material.
Any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt,
with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series.

**Selection and Notice**

If the Issuer is redeeming or purchasing less than all of the Notes issued under the Indenture at any time,
selection of the Notes to be redeemed or purchased will be made based on a method that most nearly
approximates a _pro rata selection in accordance with applicable procedures of Euroclear or_
Clearstream, as applicable; _provided that no Notes in denominations of €100,000 or less can be_
redeemed or purchased in part.

Notices of redemption or purchase will be delivered electronically or mailed by first class mail, postage
prepaid, at least 10 days (except as set forth in the sixth paragraph under “—Optional Redemption”) but
not more than 60 days (except as set forth in the seventh paragraph under “—Optional _Redemption”)_
before the redemption date to each Holder of the applicable series of Notes at such Holder’s registered
address or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable,
except that redemption notices may be delivered more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the
notice is issued in connection with a defeasance or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture with
respect to such series of Notes. The Issuer may provide in any redemption or purchase notice that


-----

payment of the redemption price and the performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such
redemption or purchase may be performed by another Person. If any Note is to be redeemed in part
only, any notice of redemption that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount
thereof that has been or is to be redeemed.

With respect to Notes represented by certificated notes, the Issuer will issue a new Note in a principal
amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note in the name of the Holder upon
cancellation of the original Note; _provided that new Notes will only be issued in minimum_
denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Notes called for
redemption or purchase become due on the date fixed for redemption or purchase, unless such
redemption or purchase is conditioned on the happening of a future event. On and after the Redemption
Date or purchase date, unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption or purchase price,
interest ceases to accrue on the Notes called for redemption or purchase.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at its discretion at any time upon giving not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the Holders of the Notes of the applicable series (with a
copy to the Trustee and Paying Agent) (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal
to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date occurring
on or prior to the redemption date) and all Additional Amounts (see “—Withholding Taxes”), if any,
then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or
otherwise, if any, if the Issuer or any Guarantor determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, or the introduction of, an official application, administration
or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including by virtue of a holding,
judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction

(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the relevant Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes of
such series would be, required to pay any Additional Amounts, and such obligation cannot be avoided
by taking reasonable measures available to the relevant Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable but not including assignment
of the obligation to make payment with respect to the Notes). In the case of redemption due to
withholding as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that is a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
at the date of this offering memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must be formally announced and
become effective after the date of this offering memorandum. In the case of redemption due to
withholding as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that becomes a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction after the date of this offering memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must be publicly
announced and become effective on or after the date the jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction. If the relevant Payor is a Guarantor, the foregoing provisions shall apply only if neither
the Issuer nor any other Guarantor is able to make payments on the Notes without the payment of such
Additional Amounts. Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with
the procedures described under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such
notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which such Payor
would be obliged to make such payment of Additional Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice
is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or
mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, such Payor will deliver to
the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting


-----

forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been
satisfied and that it would not be able to avoid the obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking
reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized
standing to the effect that such Payor has or would become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a
result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee shall accept, and will be entitled to conclusively rely on,
such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on
the Holders.

The foregoing will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor to the Issuer and to any jurisdiction in which
any successor to the Issuer is incorporated or organized, resident or engaged in business for tax purposes
or has a permanent establishment in, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof
or therein.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) (a
“Payor”) in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Guarantees, as applicable, will be made free and
clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding
or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account
of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Guarantee is made, or any
political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which the Payor is incorporated or organized, resident or engaged in
business for tax purposes or has a permanent establishment in, or any political subdivision or
taxing authority or agency thereof or therein

(each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of a Payor with
respect to any Note or Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, premium, if any,
or interest, the relevant Payor will pay to Holders of the Notes (together with such payments) such
additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts
received in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction
or withholding in respect of such Additional Amounts), will equal the amounts which would have been
received in respect of such payments on any such Note or Guarantee in the absence of such withholding
or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account
of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant Holder or the beneficial owner of a Note (or between a
fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the
relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate,
nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (including being a citizen or resident or national or domiciliary of, or carrying on a
business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from
the acquisition, ownership, holding or disposition of such Note or the receipt of any payment
in respect of the Notes or any Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial
owner of the Note to comply with a written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder or
beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 60 days before any withholding or deduction


-----

would be made), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning
the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction of the
Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other
reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation
or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption
from all or part of such Taxes, but only to the extent that the Holder or beneficial owner is
legally eligible to provide such certification or other evidence;

(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on or
with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee;

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Tax;

(5) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld pursuant to (a) Sections 1471 through 1474 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or any amended or successor version that is
substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with) and any current or
future regulations or official interpretations thereof, (b) any intergovernmental agreement
entered into in connection with the implementation of (a), or (c) any law, regulation or other
official guidance enacted in any other jurisdiction relating to an intergovernmental agreement
described in (b); or

(6) any Tax imposed by virtue of the so called Luxembourg Relibi law dated December 23, 2005,
as amended, or

(7) any combination of the above.

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable if the payment could have been made without such
deduction or withholding if the beneficial owner of the payment had presented the Note for payment
(where presentation is required for payment) within 30 days after the relevant payment was first made
available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period).

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any payment to any Holder who is a
fiduciary or a partnership (or entity treated as partnership for tax purposes) or other than the beneficial
owner of such Notes to the extent that the beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, the
member of such partnership (or such other entity treated as partnership for tax purposes) or the
beneficial owner of such Notes would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such
beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly.

The relevant Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount
deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor
will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any
Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such
form as provided in the ordinary course by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and as is reasonably
available to the Issuer and will provide such certified copies to the Trustee. For the avoidance of doubt,
in no event shall the Trustee be required to determine the amount of withholding taxes attributable to
any Holder.

If any Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made
on any Note or Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to
the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will
be payable and the amount so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent
to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay
Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor
may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to


-----

the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent will be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s
Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in either the Indenture or this “Description of Notes” there are mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this
heading to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect
thereof.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, transfer, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes
or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest
or penalties with respect thereto), that arise in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution,
issuance, delivery or registration of or receipt of payments with respect to, any Notes any Guarantee,
the Indenture, the Proceeds Loan, the Security Documents or any other document or instrument in
relation thereto, and any such taxes that arise in any jurisdiction from the enforcement of any Notes, the
Indenture, the Proceeds Loan, the Security Documents or any other document or instrument in relation
thereto (other than in each case, (i) in connection with a transfer of the Notes after this offering and
limited, solely to the extent of such taxes or similar charges or levies that arise from the receipt of any
payments of principal or interest on the Notes, to any such taxes or similar charges or levies that are not
excluded under clauses (1), (2), (4), (5) and (6) and any combination of clauses (1), (2), (4), (5) and (6)
and (ii) any Luxembourg registration duties (droits d’enregistrement) payable due to registration of any
such document when such registration is or was not required to maintain or preserve the rights of any
Holders under that document), and the Payor agrees to indemnify the Holders for any such Taxes paid
by such Holders.

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and
will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is incorporated or
organized, resident or engaged in business for tax purposes or has a permanent establishment in, or any
jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes or Guarantees
thereof is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or, in each case, any political subdivision or taxing
authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control Triggering Event_**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs after the Issue Date,
unless (i) a third party makes a change of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Issuer has
previously or concurrently delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as
described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes
(provided that Notes of €100,000 or less may only be tendered and repurchased in whole and not in
part) pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a purchase price in cash
(the “Change of Control Payment”) equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase,
subject to the right of Holders of the Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due
on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the purchase date. Within 60 days following
any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will deliver (or cause to be delivered) notice of such
Change of Control Offer electronically or by first class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder


-----

of Notes to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance
with the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, with the following information:

(1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “Change of
_Control Triggering Event,” and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of_
Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuer;

(2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 10 days nor later than
60 days from the date such notice is sent (the “Change of Control Payment Date”), except in
the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control
Triggering Event as described below;

(3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest;

(4) that unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes
accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on
the Change of Control Payment Date;

(5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will
be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect
_Purchase” on the reverse of such Notes completed or otherwise in accordance with the_
procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, to the paying agent specified in the notice
at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day
preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;

(6) that Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Notes and such
new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes
surrendered. The unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to at least €100,000 or any
integral multiple or €1,000 in excess thereof in relation to the Notes;

(7) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event,
stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of
Control Triggering Event and shall describe each such condition, and, if applicable, shall state
that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such
time (including more than 60 days after the notice is sent) as any or all such conditions shall be
satisfied or waived, or that such repurchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in
the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the Change
of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed, or such
notice or offer may be rescinded at any time in the Issuer’s sole discretion if the Issuer
determines that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived;

(8) any other instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with this Change of Control
Triggering Event covenant, that a Holder must follow; and

(9) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the
Issuer to purchase such Notes; provided that the applicable paying agent receives, not later than
the close of business on the tenth Business Day prior to the expiration date of the Change of
Control Offer, a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the holder of the Notes,
the principal amount of Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is
withdrawing its tendered Notes, or a specified portion thereof, and its election to have such
Notes purchased.

While the Notes are in global form and the Issuer makes an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant
to the Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of the Notes


-----

or withdraw such election through the facilities of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, subject to
the applicable rules and regulations.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e 1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in
connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer
will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have
breached their obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no
action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement
action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law:

(1) accept for payment all Notes issued by it or portions thereof validly tendered pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the applicable paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control
Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered and not validly withdrawn; and

(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together
with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been
tendered to and purchased by the Issuer.

The Senior Facilities provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness
to which the Company (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may provide, that certain change of
control events with respect to the Company would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change
of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture). In addition, the Existing 2026
Notes and the Existing Senior Notes contain a change of control provision similar to the provisions
described in this “—Change of Control Triggering Event” section but do not contain a leverage based
Change of Control Triggering Event feature. If we experience a change of control event that triggers a
default under the Existing Senior Notes, the Senior Facilities or any such future Indebtedness or results
in a requirement to offer to repurchase the Existing Senior Notes or the Existing 2026 Notes, we could
seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the Senior Facilities, the Existing Senior Notes, the
Existing 2026 Notes and/or such future Indebtedness. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or do
not refinance the Senior Facilities, the Existing Senior Notes, the Existing 2026 Notes and/or such future
Indebtedness, such default or failure to repurchase any tendered Existing Senior Notes and/or Existing
2026 Notes could result in amounts outstanding under the Senior Facilities, the Existing Senior Notes,
the Existing 2026 Notes or such future Indebtedness being declared due and payable and/or cause a
Securitization Facility or other financing arrangements to be wound down.

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control
Triggering Event may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds
may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases.

The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances
make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent
management. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain
transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a
Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of
Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings.
Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified
_Stock and Preferred Stock” and, in the case of Secured Indebtedness, “—Certain Covenants—Liens.”_
Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in


-----

principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes. Except for the limitations contained in such
covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders
of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control
Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and
otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of
Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of
Control Triggering Event, the Issuer (or any Affiliate of the Issuer) has made an offer to purchase (an
“Alternate Offer”) any and all Notes validly tendered at a cash price equal to or higher than the Change
of Control Payment and has purchased all Notes properly tendered in accordance with the terms of the
Alternate Offer. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the
Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or
redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be
made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control
Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making
of the Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer. A Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may
be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver
of the Indenture, Notes, Guarantees and/or Security Documents (but the Change of Control Offer may
not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents).

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body
of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the
phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty
as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether
a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the
Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event, including the definition of “Change of
_Control,” may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal_
amount of all the then outstanding Notes.

**_Asset Sales_**

The Indenture will provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale, unless:

(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration
(including, but not limited to, by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming
responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, in connection with, such Asset Sale)
at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (as determined in good faith
by the Company at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or
otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration for such Asset
Sale, together with all other Asset Sales since the Issue Date (on a cumulative basis), received
by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of Cash
Equivalents; provided that the amount of:


-----

(a) the greater of the principal amount and the carrying value of any liabilities (as reflected
on the Company’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent consolidated balance
sheet or in the footnotes thereto or, if incurred or increased subsequent to the date of
such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected on the Company’s
or such Restricted Subsidiary’s consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto
if such incurrence or increase had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance
sheet, as determined by the Company) of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary,
other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes, that are (i)
assumed by the transferee of any such assets (or a third party in connection with such
transfer) pursuant to a written agreement which releases or indemnifies the Company
or such Restricted Subsidiary from such liabilities or (ii) otherwise cancelled or
terminated in connection with the transaction;

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted or reasonably expected
by the Company acting in good faith to be converted by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary into Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the Cash Equivalents received or
expected to be received) or by their terms are required to be satisfied for Cash
Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Sale; and

(c) any Designated Non Cash Consideration received by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken together
with all other Designated Non Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c)
that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (i) £151 million and (ii)
25.0% of LTM EBITDA at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non Cash
Consideration (or, at the Company’s option, at the time of contractually agreeing to
such Asset Sale), with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non Cash
Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value, shall be deemed to be Cash Equivalents for purposes of
this provision and for no other purpose.

Within 450 days after the later of (A) the date of any Asset Sale and (B) the receipt of any Net Proceeds
of such Asset Sale, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply an amount not
to exceed the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale,

(1) to reduce Indebtedness (through a redemption, prepayment, repayment or purchase, as
applicable) as follows:

(a) Obligations under the Notes;

(b) Obligations under any Consolidated Senior Secured Indebtedness at a price of no less
than 100% of the principal amount of such Senior Secured Indebtedness, plus the
amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, thereon, and in the case of revolving
obligations (other than Obligations in respect of any asset based credit facility, any
revolving credit facility used for working capital purposes or the Revolving Facility),
to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto;

(c) Obligations of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that is not the Issuer or a
Guarantor, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary,
and, in the case of revolving obligations (other than Obligations in respect of any asset
based credit facility, any revolving facility used for working capital purposes or the
Revolving Facility), to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; or

(d) to the extent such Net Proceeds are from an Asset Sale of property or assets of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor or of property or assets not
constituting Collateral, Obligations of the Issuer or a Guarantor other than


-----

Subordinated Indebtedness and other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary, and, in the case of revolving obligations (other than Obligations
in respect of any asset based credit facility, any revolving credit facility used for
working capital purposes or the Revolving Facility), to correspondingly reduce
commitments with respect thereto;

_provided that to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected to purchase any_
amount of Obligations under the Notes, Senior Secured Indebtedness at a price of no less than 100% of
the principal amount thereof, to the extent the creditors in respect of such Indebtedness (including the
Holders) elect not to tender their Indebtedness, the Company will be deemed to have applied an amount
of Net Proceeds equal to such amount not so tendered, and such amount shall not increase the amount
of Excess Proceeds (such amount, together with the aggregate amount described under the first sentence
of the fifth paragraph of this covenant, the “Declined Proceeds”); or

(2) to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses; provided that such Investment in any
business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Company or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such
business such that it constitutes or continues to constitute a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) capital
expenditures or (c) acquisitions of other properties or assets that, in each of (a), (b) and (c), are
used or useful in a Similar Business or replace the businesses, properties and/ or assets that are
the subject of such Asset Sale; or

(3) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that a binding commitment or letter of intent entered into not later than such 450th day shall_
be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment or letter of
intent so long as the Company, or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment or letter of
intent with the good faith expectation that such Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment
or letter of intent within the later of such 450th day and 180 days of such commitment or letter of intent
(an “Acceptable Commitment”) or, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or
terminated for any reason before the Net Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, the Company or
such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a “Second Commitment”)
within 180 days of such cancellation or termination; provided, further, that if any Second Commitment
is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, then such Net
Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds, as the case may be.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that the application of any or all
of the Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale by the Company or a Subsidiary is (x) prohibited or delayed by
applicable local law, (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents or any agreement or (z)
subject to other organizational or administrative impediments from being repatriated under applicable
local law, an amount equal to the portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be
applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary; _provided that if at any time within one year following the date on which the_
respective payment would otherwise have been required, such repatriation of any of such affected Net
Proceeds is permitted under the applicable local law, the applicable organizational document or
agreement or the applicable other impediment, an amount equal to such amount of Net Proceeds so
permitted to be repatriated will be promptly applied (net of any taxes, costs or expenses that would be
payable or reserved against if such amounts were actually repatriated whether or not they are
repatriated) in compliance with this covenant and (ii) to the extent that the Company has determined in
good faith that repatriation of any or all of the Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale could have a material
adverse tax consequence with respect to such Net Proceeds (which for the avoidance of doubt, includes,
but is not limited to, any prepayment whereby doing so the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary or any
of their respective Affiliates and/or their equityholders would incur a tax liability, including as a result
of a tax dividend or a withholding tax), the Net Proceeds so affected may be retained by the Company
or the applicable Subsidiary and an amount equal to such Net Proceeds will not be required to be applied


-----

in compliance with this covenant. The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of
the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default.
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Indenture shall be construed to require the Company or any
Subsidiary to repatriate cash.

Any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale (other than any amounts excluded from this covenant as set forth
in the immediately preceding paragraph) that are not invested or applied as provided and within the
time period set forth in the second preceding paragraph; _provided that only to the extent that the_
Consolidated Total Debt Ratio exceeds 5.65 to 1.00, an amount not to exceed the Net Proceeds from
such Asset Sale (or, (x) if the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio exceeds 5.15 to 1.00 but does not exceed
5.65 to 1.00, 50% of the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale; or (y) if the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio
does not exceed 5.15 to 1.00, 0% of the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale) shall be deemed to
constitute “Excess Proceeds”; provided, further, that any amount of Net Proceeds offered to Holders of
the Notes pursuant to the second preceding paragraph (1) shall not be deemed to be Excess Proceeds
without regard to whether such offer is accepted by any Holders. When the aggregate amount of Excess
Proceeds exceeds the greater of (x) £181 million and (y) 30.0% of LTM EBITDA (the “Excess Proceeds
_Threshold”), the Issuer shall make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all Holders of the Notes and, if_
required or permitted by the terms of any Indebtedness that ranks pari passu in right of payment with
the Notes (“Pari Passu Indebtedness”), to the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the
maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such Pari
Passu Indebtedness that is, with respect to the Notes only, in an amount equal to €100,000, or an integral
multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof, that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price,
in the case of the Notes, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted
value thereof, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of such
offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, and in the case of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness, at the offer price required by the terms thereof, in accordance with the procedures set
forth in the agreement(s) governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness. The Issuer will commence an Asset
Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within 20 Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds
exceed the Excess Proceeds Threshold by delivering to the Holders the notice required pursuant to the
terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with
respect to any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Net
Proceeds prior to the time period that may be required by the Indenture with respect to all or a part of
the available Net Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the
Indenture (an “Advance Offer”).

To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the amount
offered in the Asset Sale Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer
may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) for
any purposes not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or
accreted value, if applicable) of Notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, surrendered
by such holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in the Asset Sale Offer (or in the case of an Advance
Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer shall purchase the Notes (subject to the applicable procedures
of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, as to global notes) and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the
case may be, on a pro rata basis based on the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if
applicable) of the Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered with adjustments
as necessary so that no Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in
part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer (or Advance
Offer), the amount of Excess Proceeds that resulted in the requirement to make an Asset Sale Offer
shall be reset to zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such
completion). Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Sale Offer, any remaining Net Proceeds
shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer may use such Net Proceeds for any purpose not
otherwise prohibited under the Indenture.


-----

An Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with
respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, the Notes and/or the Guarantees (but
the Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents).

Pending the final application of the amount of any Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the Company
and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness, or otherwise use such Net
Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e 1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in
connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or an Advance Offer. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the
Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be
deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders
of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes.

The Senior Facilities contain, and future credit agreements or other similar agreements to which the
Issuer becomes a party may contain restrictions on the Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes. In the event
an Asset Sale occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing Notes, the Issuer could
seek the consent of its lenders to the repurchase of Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings
that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the
Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing Notes. In such a case, the Issuer’s failure to repurchase
tendered Notes would constitute a Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, likely constitute a
default under such other agreements.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the Indenture that will apply to the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

If on any date following the Issue Date, (i) the Notes have an Investment Grade Rating from either of
the Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (the
occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as
a “Covenant Suspension Event” and the date thereof being referred to as the “Suspension Date”), then,
the covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this “Description of Notes” section of
this offering memorandum will no longer be applicable to such Notes (collectively, the “Suspended
_Covenants”) until the occurrence of the Reversion Date (as defined below):_

(1) “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”;

(2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(3) “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
_Stock”;_

(4) clause (3) of the first paragraph and the entire fourth paragraph of “—Merger, Consolidation
_or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets”;_

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates”;

(6) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”; and

(7) “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries.”


-----

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, the Company may not designate
any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

If and while the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants,
the Notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the event that the Company and
its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture for any
period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) the Notes
no longer have an Investment Grade Rating or the Rating Agency withdraws its Investment Grade
Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating (in each case,
to the extent given an Investment Grade Rating by such Rating Agency), then the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture
with respect to future events. The period of time between the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date
is referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period.” The Guarantees of the Subsidiary
Guarantors will be suspended during the Suspension Period. Additionally, upon the occurrence of a
Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds from any Asset Sales shall be reset to zero.

During the Suspension Period, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur
Liens to the extent provided for under “—Liens” (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens) and
any Permitted Liens which may refer to one or more Suspended Covenants shall be interpreted as
though such applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued to be applicable during the Suspension Period
(but solely for purposes of the “—Liens” covenant and the “Permitted Liens” and “Permitted Collateral
_Liens” definitions and for no other covenant)._

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such reinstatement of the Suspended Covenants, no
action taken or omitted to be taken by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such
reinstatement will give rise to a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture with respect to the
Notes, and no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to exist or have occurred as a result of any
failure by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply with any of the Suspended Covenants
during the Suspension Period; provided that (1) with respect to Restricted Payments (as defined herein)
made after such reinstatement, the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments will be
calculated as though the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”
had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period (including with respect to a Limited
Condition Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period); (2) all Indebtedness incurred or
committed, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period (or deemed
incurred or issued in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction entered into during the
Suspension Period) will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (2)(C) of the
second paragraph of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock
_and Preferred Stock”; (3) any Affiliate Transaction (as defined herein) entered into after such_
reinstatement pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to
be permitted pursuant to clause (6) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—
_Transactions with Affiliates”; (4) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted_
Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor to take any action described in clauses (1) through (3)
of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions
_Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed_
to be permitted pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—
_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”; (5) no Subsidiary of the_
Company shall be required to comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Guarantees
_of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” after such reinstatement with respect to any guarantee or_
obligation entered into by such Subsidiary during any Suspension Period; and (6) all Investments made
during the Suspension Period (or deemed made in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction
entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been made under clause (5) of the
definition of “Permitted Investments.”

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated after the Reversion Date, (1) no
Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes


-----

or the Guarantees with respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension
Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising during any
Suspension Period, in each case as a result of a failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during
the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the Suspension Period or after that time based solely on
any action taken or event that occurred during the Suspension Period), and (2) following a Reversion
Date, the Company and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event
of Default, to honour, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations
arising during any Suspension Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Rating.
The Trustee shall be notified of a Covenant Suspension Event. The Trustee shall have no duty to (i)
monitor the ratings of the Notes, (ii) ascertain whether a Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date
have occurred, or (iii) notify the Holders of any of the foregoing.

**_Limited Condition Transactions_**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture or compliance with any
provision of the Indenture in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or
transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence or issuance of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence of
Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Sales), in each case, at the option of the Company
(the Company’s election to exercise such option, an “LCT Election”), the date of determination for
availability under any such basket or ratio and whether any such action or transaction is permitted (or
any requirement or condition therefor is complied with or satisfied (including as to the absence of any
continuing Default or Event of Default)) under the Indenture shall be deemed to be the date (the “LCT
_Test Date”) either (a) the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Transaction are entered into_
(or, if applicable, the date of delivery of an irrevocable notice, declaration of a Restricted Payment or
similar event), or (b) solely in connection with an acquisition to which the United Kingdom City Code
on Takeovers and Mergers applies, the date on which a “Rule 2.7 announcement” of a firm intention to
make an offer in respect of a target of a Limited Condition Transaction (or any substantially equivalent
announcement in any other jurisdiction) and, in each case, if, after giving pro forma effect to the Limited
Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions,
Investments, the incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and the
use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Sales) and
any related pro forma adjustments, the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been
permitted to take such actions or consummate such transactions on the relevant LCT Test Date in
compliance with such ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and conditions), such ratio, test
or basket (and any related requirements and conditions) shall be deemed to have been complied with
(or satisfied) for all purposes (in the case of Indebtedness, for example, whether such Indebtedness is
committed, issued or incurred at the LCT Test Date or at any time thereafter); _provided that (a) if_
financial statements for one or more subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become available, the
Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to re determine all such ratios, tests or baskets on the basis
of such financial statements, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to
be the applicable LCT Test Date for purposes of such ratios, tests or baskets, (b) except as contemplated
in the foregoing clause (a), compliance with such ratios, tests or baskets (and any related requirements
and conditions) shall not be determined or tested at any time after the applicable LCT Test Date for
such Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including
acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and
Asset Sales) and (c) Consolidated Interest Expense for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
will be calculated using an assumed interest rate based on the indicative interest margin contained in
any financing commitment documentation with respect to such Indebtedness or, if no such indicative
interest margin exists, as reasonably determined by the Company in good faith.


-----

For the avoidance of doubt, if the Company has made an LCT Election, (1) if any of the ratios, tests or
baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after
the LCT Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of
fluctuations in any such ratio, test or basket, including due to fluctuations in EBITDA or total assets of
the Company or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction, such baskets, tests or ratios
will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such
fluctuations; (2) if any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any
continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested
as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date not have been complied with or
satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of a Default or an Event of Default), such
requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied
(and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing); and (3)
in calculating the availability under any ratio, test or basket in connection with any action or transaction
unrelated to such Limited Condition Transaction following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the
earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the date that the
definitive agreement or date for redemption, purchase or repayment specified in an irrevocable notice
for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated, expires or passes, as applicable, without
consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio, test or basket shall be determined
or tested giving pro forma effect to such Limited Condition Transaction.

**_Certain Compliance Calculations_**

If any baskets, thresholds or exceptions determined by reference to a fixed currency amount or a
percentage of LTM EBITDA (“fixed baskets”) are intended to be utilized together with any baskets,
thresholds or exceptions determined by reference to the Consolidated Senior Secured Debt Ratio, the
Consolidated Total Secured Debt Ratio, the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio or any other financial ratio or metric (a “ratio based basket”) in a single transaction or action or
series of related transactions or actions (for the purposes of this paragraph, a “Relevant Transaction”):
(x) amounts available to be incurred under the applicable ratio based baskets shall be calculated without
giving effect to amounts to be incurred under the applicable fixed baskets in connection with such
Relevant Transaction, or amounts previously incurred under such fixed basket and not reclassified that
are being repaid in connection with such Relevant Transaction, unless otherwise elected by the
Company; (y) full pro forma effect shall be given to all increases to LTM EBITDA and repayments or
discharges of Indebtedness in connection with such Relevant Transaction in accordance with the
Indenture; and (z) pro forma effect shall not be given to any incurrence or drawing of any Indebtedness
used to finance working capital needs of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection
with the Relevant Transaction (as reasonably determined by the Company).

If any amount is incurred or utilized under any ratio based basket, such amount shall be permitted
notwithstanding any subsequent decline in the Consolidated Senior Secured Debt Ratio, the
Consolidated Total Secured Debt Ratio, the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio or any other financial ratio or metric.

If (x) any restriction, basket, threshold or permission is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed
amount (the “fixed component”) and a percentage of LTM EBITDA (the “grower component”) and (y)
the grower component of the applicable restriction, basket, threshold or permission exceeds the
applicable fixed component at any time, the fixed component shall be deemed to be increased to the
highest amount of the grower component reached from time to time and shall not subsequently be
reduced as a result of any decrease in the grower component.

If (x) a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) is incurred or entered into
pursuant to a fixed basket or the grower component of any other basket and (y) at a later time would
subsequently be permitted under a ratio based basket, unless otherwise elected by the Company, such
action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such
ratio based basket.


-----

If (x) any transaction is entered into between (A) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and (B)
any other Person which is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the date of such transaction; (y) such
transaction is permitted pursuant to a fixed basket or an incurrence based basket; and (z) following such
transaction, such other Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, such transaction shall be deemed to be
reallocated to any applicable basket allowing transactions of such type to be entered into on an unlimited
basis between the Company and a Restricted Subsidiary or between Restricted Subsidiaries.

If a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than
one applicable basket, permission or threshold under the Indenture, the Company shall be entitled to
divide or classify or later divide or reclassify (based on circumstances existing on the date of such
reclassification) such action, matter or amount (or a portion thereof) between such baskets, permissions
or thresholds as it shall elect from time to time.

For purposes of determining compliance with any restriction, basket, threshold or permission under the
Indenture: (x) any reference to an amount in a given currency shall be deemed to include reference to
its Currency Equivalent in other currencies; (y) no amount incurred or utilized under any restriction,
basket, threshold or permission will be deemed to be increased as a result of (A) any change in
applicable currency exchange rates after the date on which the Currency Equivalent of such incurrence
or utilization was calculated under the Indenture for the purpose of permitting such incurrence or
utilization; or (B) any election made from time to time under the definition of “GAAP” after the date on
which such incurrence or utilization was calculated under the Indenture for the purpose of permitting
such incurrence or utilization; and (z) for the avoidance of doubt, any restriction, basket, threshold or
permission which would (but for sub clause (y) above) be exceeded as a result of (i) any change in
applicable currency exchange rates; or (ii) any election made from time to time under the definition of
“GAAP,” shall be deemed not to have been exceeded and it shall be deemed that no Default, Event of
Default or breach of any representation and warranty or undertaking under the Indenture has arisen in
connection therewith.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is committed, incurred or issued, any Lien is
committed or incurred or any other transaction is undertaken, in reliance on a ratio based basket based
on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Debt Ratio, the Consolidated
Total Secured Debt Ratio or the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, such ratio(s) shall be calculated without
regard to the commitment or incurrence of any Indebtedness under any revolving facility or letter of
credit facility (including under the Revolving Facility or any ancillary facility in respect thereof).

If (x) any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock, Preferred Stock or financing liability (a “Refinancing
_Amount”) is or is to be issued or incurred to refinance or replace any existing or previous Indebtedness,_
Disqualified Stock, Preferred Stock or financing liability; and (y) such refinancing or replacement
would otherwise cause any applicable restriction, basket, threshold or permission to be exceeded, such
restriction, basket, threshold or permission shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the
principal amount of such Refinancing Amount does not exceed the principal amount of the existing or
previous Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock, Preferred Stock or financing liability being refinanced or
replaced (plus all accrued, paid in kind, capitalized or accreted interest, prepayment premia, break costs
and other fees, costs, expenses and amounts accrued thereon or incurred in connection with such
refinancing or replacement).

Any calculation or measure that is determined with reference to the Company’s financial statements
(including, without limitation, EBITDA, Consolidated Interest Expense, Consolidated Net Income,
Consolidated Senior Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total
Debt Ratio, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Fixed Charges, and clause (B)(1) of the first paragraph of
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) may be determined with
reference to the financial statements of a direct or indirect parent entity of the Company instead, so long
as such parent entity does not hold any material assets other than, directly or indirectly, the Equity
Interests of the Company (as determined in good faith by the Company).


-----

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any payment or distribution on account of the Company’s,

_provided that at the time of, and after giving effect to, (x) any Restricted Payment other than a Restricted_
Investment permitted under clause (11)(ii) above, no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof or (y) any Restricted Investment permitted under
clause (11)(ii) above, no Event of Default under clauses (1), (2) or (6) of the first paragraph of “—
_Events of Default and Remedies” shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a_
consequence thereof.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a proposed Restricted
Payment (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of clauses (1) through (20) above and/or one or more
of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,” or is entitled to be made pursuant
to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company will be entitled to divide or classify or later divide

Payment (or a portion thereof) between such clauses (1) through (20) and such first paragraph and/or
one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,” in any manner that
otherwise complies with this covenant.

As of the Issue Date, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. The Company
will not permit any Unrestricted Subsidiary to become a Restricted Subsidiary except pursuant to the
penultimate sentence of the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.” For purposes of designating any
Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, all outstanding Investments by the Company and
its Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid) in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed
to be Restricted Payments in an amount determined as set forth in the penultimate sentence of the
definition of “Investments.” Such designation will be permitted only if a Restricted Payment in such
amount would be permitted at such time, pursuant to this covenant or pursuant to the definition of
“Permitted Investments,” and if such Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants set forth in
the Indenture.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant:

-----

(2) the Company will be entitled to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock in more than one of the types of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock described in the first and second paragraphs above;

(3) guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments
are incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to any
clause of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit,
bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock, then such other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or

(6) for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured
Debt Ratio, the Consolidated Total Secured Debt Ratio or the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio,
as applicable, in connection with the incurrence of any Indebtedness pursuant to the first or
second paragraph above or the creation or incurrence of any Lien pursuant to the definition of
“Permitted Liens,” the Company may elect, at its option, to treat all or any portion of the
committed amount of any Indebtedness (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and
bankers’ acceptances thereunder), including any portion of any committed amount of any
Indebtedness of Persons that are acquired by the Person or any Restricted Subsidiary or merged

(any such committed amount elected until revoked as described below, the “Reserved
_Indebtedness Amount”), as being incurred as of such election date, and, if such Fixed Charge_
Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Secured Debt
Ratio or Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, as applicable, is satisfied or, in the case of paragraph
(12)(b) of the second paragraph above, is no worse in accordance with the terms thereof, with
respect thereto on such election date, any subsequent borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and
the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be
deemed to be permitted under this covenant or the definition of “Permitted Liens,” as
applicable, whether or not the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured
Debt Ratio, the Consolidated Total Secured Debt Ratio or the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio,
as applicable, at the actual time of any subsequent borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or
creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) is met; _provided that for_
purposes of subsequent calculations of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated
Senior Secured Debt Ratio, the Consolidated Total Secured Debt Ratio or the Consolidated
Total Debt Ratio, as applicable, the Reserved Indebtedness Amount shall be deemed to be
outstanding, whether or not such amount is actually outstanding, for so long as such
commitments are outstanding or until the Company revokes an election of a Reserved
Indebtedness Amount.

Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, of the same class will not be deemed to be
an incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant. If
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock originally incurred in reliance upon a percentage


-----

of LTM EBITDA under this covenant is being refinanced and such refinancing would cause the
maximum amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock thereunder to be exceeded at
such time, then such refinancing will nevertheless be permitted thereunder and such additional
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock will be deemed to have been incurred under the
applicable provision so long as the principal amount or liquidation preference of such Refinancing
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not exceed the principal amount or liquidation
preference of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced plus amounts
permitted by the next sentence. Any Refinancing Indebtedness and any Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock permitted to be incurred under the Indenture to refinance Indebtedness incurred
pursuant to clauses (1), (3), (8), (10)(b) and (21) shall be deemed to include additional Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to pay accrued but unpaid interest or dividends,
premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting or initial purchaser discounts,
fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection
with such refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with any restriction, as applicable, on the incurrence of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in a given currency, the Currency
Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness or liquidation preference of Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
was incurred, or, at the option of the Company, first committed or first incurred or upon execution of
the definitive documentation in respect thereof (whichever yields the lower Currency Equivalent);
_provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in_
another currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable currency denominated restriction to
be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing,
such currency denominated restriction, as applicable, shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so
long as the principal amount or liquidation preference of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not
exceed the principal amount or liquidation preference set forth in sub clause (A) of the definition of
“Refinancing Indebtedness,” and (b) the Currency Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of any
such Indebtedness and the aggregate liquidation preference of any such Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock outstanding on the Acquisition Completion Date shall be calculated based on the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the Acquisition Completion Date and the Currency Equivalent of
the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness and the aggregate liquidation preference of
any such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock outstanding on the Issue Date that was not outstanding
on the Acquisition Completion Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate
in effect on the Issue Date, and (c) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock is subject to any Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which such
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is denominated covering principal amounts and
interest payable on such Indebtedness or the liquidation preference and preferred equity returns on such
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, the amount of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock if denominated in a given currency will be the amount of the principal payment or liquidation
preference required to be made under such Currency Agreement and, otherwise, the Currency
Equivalent of such amount plus the Currency Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and
payable but is not covered by such Currency Agreement.

The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured
Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other
Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or because it is
secured by different collateral or issued or guaranteed by other obligors.

**_Liens_**

The Company will not, and will not permit the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor to, and it shall be a
default in respect of the Company if Midco shall, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or suffer
to exist any Lien (except (i) in the case of any property or asset or income or profits therefrom that does


-----

not constitute Collateral or constitutes Collateral solely by virtue of being subject to a “floating charge”
or other “floating” security, Permitted Liens or (ii) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes
Collateral or the quotas or shares in the capital of Gardaland S.r.l., Permitted Collateral Liens) (each, a
“Subject Lien”) that secures Obligations under any Indebtedness or any related guarantee of
Indebtedness, on any asset or property of the Issuer, Midco (in the case of Midco, solely to the extent
the Collateral owned by it is so secured) or any Guarantor, or any income or profits therefrom, or assign
or convey any right to receive income therefrom, unless:

(1) in the case of Subject Liens on any Collateral, the Notes and the Guarantees thereof are secured
by a Lien on such asset, property, income or profits that is senior in priority to such Subject Lien;
and

(2) in all other cases, the Notes and the Guarantees are equally and ratably secured.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes pursuant to sub clause (2) of this covenant
shall be deemed automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and
discharge of the Subject Lien that gave rise to the obligation to secure the Notes. In addition, the
Company may, at its option and without consent from any Holder, elect to release and discharge any
Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the sub clauses (1) or (2) of the preceding
paragraph in respect of such Subject Lien.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the
time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased
Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase
in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted
value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional
Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and
increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange
rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets_**

_The Company and the Issuer_

Neither the Company nor the Issuer may consolidate or merge with or into or wind up into (whether or
not the Company or the Issuer is the surviving Person), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets, in one or more related transactions,
to any Person unless:

(1) (a) the Company or the Issuer is the surviving Person or (b) the Person formed by or surviving
any such consolidation, amalgamation or merger (if other than the Company or the Issuer, as
the case may be) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other
disposition will have been made (such Person being herein called the “Successor Company”),
(i) expressly assumes, in the case of the Company, all the obligations of the Company under
the Indenture and its Guarantee, or, in the case of the Issuer, all of the obligations of the Issuer
under the Indenture and the Notes, in each case, pursuant to supplemental indentures or other
applicable documents or instruments and (ii) is a Person organized or existing under the laws
of a member country of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (or any

thereof;

(2) immediately after such transaction, no Event of Default exists;


-----

(3) immediately after giving _pro forma effect to such transaction and any related financing_
transactions, as if such transactions had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four quarter
period:

(a) the Company or the Successor Company, as applicable, would be permitted to incur at
least £1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
_Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”; or_

(b) either (x) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries or the Successor Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, as applicable,
would be equal to or greater than the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Company
and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction or (y) the
Consolidated Total Debt Ratio for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries or the
Successor Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, as applicable, would be equal to
or less than the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio for the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction; and

(4) the Company or, if applicable, the Successor Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger
or transfer and such supplemental indentures, if any, comply with the Indenture; and

(5) to the extent any assets of the Person which is merged, consolidated or amalgamated with or
into the Company or the Issuer, as applicable, are assets of the type which would constitute
Collateral under the Security Documents in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles,
the Company, the Issuer or the Successor Company, as applicable, shall take such action, if
any, as may be reasonably necessary to cause such property and assets to be made subject to
the Lien of the applicable Security Documents in the manner and to the extent required in
accordance with the applicable Security Documents (including the Agreed Security Principles).

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, the Company or the Issuer, as the case
may be, under the Indenture, the Guarantees and the Notes, as applicable, and the Company or the
Issuer, as applicable, will automatically be released and discharged from their respective obligations
under the Indenture, the Guarantees and the Notes, as applicable.

the purpose of reorganizing the Company or the Issuer in any other jurisdiction so long as the
amount of Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries is not increased thereby.

_Subsidiary Guarantors_

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture governing release of a Guarantee upon the sale,
disposition or transfer of a Subsidiary Guarantor, no Subsidiary Guarantor will, and the Company will
not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to, consolidate or merge with or into or wind up into (whether or
not such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or


-----

otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets, in one or more related transactions,
to any Person unless:

(1)

(a) (i) such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person or (ii) the Person formed by or
surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than such Subsidiary Guarantor)
or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will
have been made (such Person being herein called the “Successor Person”) expressly
assumes all the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Indenture and such
Subsidiary Guarantor’s related Guarantee pursuant to supplemental indentures or other
applicable documents or instruments; and

(b) to the extent any assets of the Person which is merged, consolidated or amalgamated
with or into such Guarantor are assets of the type which are required to constitute
Collateral under the Security Documents in accordance with the Agreed Security
Principles, such Guarantor or the Successor Person shall take such action, if any, as
may be reasonably necessary to cause such property and assets to be made subject to
the Lien of the applicable Security Documents in the manner and to the extent required
in accordance with the applicable Security Documents and shall take all reasonably
necessary action so that such Lien is perfected to the extent required by the Agreed
Security Principles; or

(2) the transaction is not prohibited by the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—
_Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”; or_

(3) in the case of assets comprised of Equity Interests of Subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary
Guarantors, such Equity Interests are sold, assigned, transferred, leased, conveyed or otherwise
disposed of to one or more Restricted Subsidiaries.

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Successor Person will succeed to, and be
substituted for, such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Indenture and such Subsidiary Guarantor’s
Guarantee, and such Subsidiary Guarantor will automatically be released and discharged from its
obligations under the Indenture, the Notes and such Subsidiary Guarantor’s Guarantee.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Subsidiary Guarantor may (a) merge or consolidate with or into,
wind up into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to a Guarantor or the Issuer (or a Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor if that Restricted Subsidiary becomes a Subsidiary
Guarantor), (b) merge with an Affiliate of the Company solely for the purpose of reorganizing the
Subsidiary Guarantor in another jurisdiction, (c) convert into a corporation, partnership, limited
partnership, limited liability company or trust organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction
of organization of such Subsidiary Guarantor or (d) liquidate or dissolve or change its legal form if the
Company determines in good faith that such action is in the best interests of the Company, in each case,
without regard to the requirements set forth in the second preceding paragraph.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or
_Substantially All Assets” covenant, the Company may contribute Capital Stock of any or all of its_
Subsidiaries to any Guarantor.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to,
or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property
or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding,
loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Company (each of the


-----

foregoing, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of the
greater of (x) £91 million and (y) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA at such time, unless:

length basis or, if in the good faith judgment of the Company, no comparable transaction is
available with which to compare such Affiliate Transaction, such Affiliate Transaction is
otherwise fair to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view and

such amendment or replacement and (b) the payment of indemnification and other similar
amounts to the Investors and reimbursement of expenses of the Investors;

Captive Insurance Subsidiary or a Securitization Subsidiary, to guarantee the payment of (i) any
syndicated Credit Facility incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on
_Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” or (ii) capital_
market debt securities of the Issuer or any Guarantor in an aggregate principal amount in excess of the
greater of (x) £301 million and (y) 50.0% of LTM EBITDA at such time, unless:

(1) such Restricted Subsidiary within 60 days after the guarantee of such Indebtedness executes
and delivers a supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such
Restricted Subsidiary, except that with respect to a guarantee of Indebtedness of the Issuer or
any Subsidiary Guarantor, if such Indebtedness is by its express terms subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes or such Subsidiary Guarantor’s Guarantee, any such guarantee by such
Restricted Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of
payment to such Guarantee substantially to the same extent as such Indebtedness is
subordinated to the Notes; and


-----

(2) such Restricted Subsidiary waives and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or take the
benefit or advantage of, any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any other
applicable rights against the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary as a result of any
payment by such Restricted Subsidiary under its Guarantee;

_provided that this covenant shall not be applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that_
existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with,
or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary. The Company may elect, in its
sole discretion, to cause any Subsidiary that is not otherwise required to be a Subsidiary Guarantor to
become a Subsidiary Guarantor, in which case such Subsidiary shall not be required to comply with the
60 day period described in clause (1) above.

**_Reports and Other Information_**

For so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Company will provide to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company thereafter, annual reports
containing, to the extent applicable, the following information: (a) audited consolidated balance
sheets of the Company or its predecessor as of the end of the most recent fiscal year and audited
consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Company or its predecessor
for the most recent fiscal year, including complete footnotes to such financial statements and
the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (b) unaudited _pro forma_
income statement information and balance sheet information of the Company (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of a full income statement or balance sheet
to the extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory footnotes, for any material
acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most
recently completed fiscal year; (c) an operating and financial review of the audited financial
statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity
and capital resources of the Company, and a discussion of material commitments and
contingencies and critical accounting policies; (d) a description of the business, management
and shareholders of the Company, all material affiliate transactions and a description of all
material contractual arrangements, including material debt instruments; and (e) a summary
description of material risk factors and material recent developments;

(2) within (x) 90 days after the end of the first applicable fiscal quarter of the Company ending
after the Issue Date and (y) 75 days after the end of each applicable fiscal quarter of the
Company thereafter, all quarterly reports of the Company in respect of the second fiscal quarter
in each fiscal year of the Company containing the following information: (a) an unaudited
condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed
statements of income and cash flow for the most recent year to date period ending on the
unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and the comparable prior year period, together with
condensed footnote disclosure; (b) unaudited pro forma income statement information and
balance sheet information of the Company (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include
the provision of a full income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available),
together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or
recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the relevant quarter; (c) an operating
and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the results
of operations, financial condition, EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA and material changes in
liquidity and capital resources of the Company, and a discussion of material changes not in the
ordinary course of business in commitments and contingencies since the most recent report;
and (d) material recent developments; and

(3) within 60 days after the end of each applicable fiscal quarter of the Company ending after the
Issue Date, all quarterly reports of the Company in respect of the first and third fiscal quarters
in each fiscal year of the Company containing the following information: (a) an unaudited


-----

condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed
statements of income and cash flow for the most recent year to date period ending on the
unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and the comparable prior year period, together with
condensed footnote disclosure; (b) unaudited pro forma income statement information and
balance sheet information of the Company (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include
the provision of a full income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably available),
together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or
recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the relevant quarter; (c) an operating
and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the results
of operations, financial condition, EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA and material changes in
liquidity and capital resources of the Company, and a discussion of material changes not in the
ordinary course of business in commitments and contingencies since the most recent report;
and (d) material recent developments.

All financial statement and pro forma financial information shall, at the election of the Company, be
prepared in accordance with IFRS or U.S. GAAP. At the Company’s election, it may comply with the
provisions of this covenant by furnishing the applicable financial statements and/or other financial
information of Midco, MEL or an indirect or direct parent company of the Company (an “Alternative
_Reporting Entity”), in each case, in lieu of those for the Company and as if references to “the Company”_
in this covenant were to such Alternative Reporting Entity; _provided that a reasonably detailed_
description of any material differences between the financial statements and/or other financial
information of the Company, on one hand, and the Alternative Reporting Entity, on the other, shall be
included for any period after the Acquisition Completion Date. Following an IPO of the Capital Stock
of an IPO Entity or the listing of such Capital Stock on a recognized stock exchange, the requirements
of this covenant shall be considered to have been fulfilled if the IPO Entity or MEL (as applicable)
complies with the reporting requirements of such stock exchange.

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary,
constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the Company, then the annual and quarterly financial information
required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant shall include either (i) a reasonably
detailed presentation, either on the face thereof or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition
and results of operations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial
condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Company; or (ii) stand alone
audited or unaudited financial statements, as the case may be, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary or
Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as a group or otherwise) together with an unaudited reconciliation to the
financial information of the Company and its Subsidiaries, which reconciliation shall include the
following items: revenues, EBITDA, net income, cash, total assets, total debt, shareholders equity,
capital expenditures and interest expense.

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Trustee of the reports specified in clauses (1) and
(2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company shall also (a) use its commercially reasonable
efforts (i) to post copies of such reports on such website as may be then maintained by the Company
and its Subsidiaries or (ii) otherwise to provide substantially comparable availability of such reports (as
determined by the Company in good faith) or (b) to the extent the Company determines in good faith
that it cannot make such reports available in the manner described in the preceding clause (a) owing to
applicable law or after the use of its commercially reasonable efforts, furnish such reports to the Holders
and, upon request, prospective purchasers of the Notes. In addition, so long as the Notes remain
outstanding and during any period during which the Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3 2(b), the Company shall furnish to the
Holders and, upon their request, prospective purchasers of the Notes, the information required to be
delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.


-----

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company will not be deemed to have failed to
comply with any of its obligations hereunder for purposes of clause (3) under “—Events of Default and
_Remedies” until 180 days after the receipt of the written notice delivered thereunder._

To the extent any information is not provided within the time periods specified in this section “—
_Reports and Other Information” and such information is subsequently provided, the Company will be_
deemed to have satisfied its obligations with respect thereto at such time and any Default with respect
thereto shall be deemed to have been cured.

Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee shall be for informational purposes
only, and the Trustee’s receipt of such reports, information and documents shall not constitute
constructive notice of any information contained therein, including the Company’s and the Issuer’s
compliance with any of the covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively
on an Officer’s Certificate).

**_Events of Default and Remedies_**

The Indenture will provide that each of the following is an “Event of Default”:

(1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of
principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes;

(2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to the Notes;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of written notice given by the
Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a
default referred to in clause (1) or (2) above) contained in the Indenture or the Notes;

(4) (i) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which
there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the issuance
of the Notes, if both:

(a) such default has not been remedied or waived and either results from the failure to pay
any principal of such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any
applicable grace periods) or relates to an obligation other than the obligation to pay
principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity and results in the holder
or holders of such Indebtedness causing such Indebtedness to become due prior to its
stated maturity; and

(b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any
other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity
(after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been
so accelerated, aggregate £175.0 million (or its foreign currency equivalent) or more
outstanding;

(5) (i) failure by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Company for
a fiscal quarter end provided as required under “—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other
_Information”) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final judgments aggregating in_
excess of £175.0 million (net of amounts covered by insurance policies issued by reputable
insurance companies), which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a
period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment


-----

is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon
such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company or any Significant
Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together (as of the latest consolidated
financial statements of the Company for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under “—
_Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information”) would constitute a Significant_
Subsidiary);

(7) the Guarantee of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or
any group of Subsidiary Guarantors that together (as of the latest consolidated financial
statements of the Company for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under “—Reports and
_Other Information”) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) shall for any reason cease to be_
in full force and effect or be declared null and void or any responsible officer of the Company
or any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or the responsible officers of any
group of Subsidiary Guarantors that together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements
of the Company for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under “—Certain Covenants—
_Reports and Other Information”) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), as the case may_
be, denies in writing that it has any further liability under its Guarantee or gives written notice
to such effect, other than by reason of the termination of the Indenture or the release of any such
Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture and any such default continues for ten days; and

(8) only to the extent required in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles, the Liens created
by the Security Documents cease to constitute valid and perfected Liens on any material portion
of the Collateral (taken as a whole) and such cessation occurs other than (A) in accordance with
the terms of the relevant Security Document and the Indenture, (B) following the satisfaction
in full of all Obligations under the Indenture or (C) as a result of any failure by the Security
Agent to exercise its right for delivery of documents or otherwise, and (ii) such default
continues for 60 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or the Holders of not
less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes.

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing
under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of
all the then outstanding Notes may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other
monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately; provided,
_however, that a Default under clauses (3), (4), (5), (7) or (8) of the first paragraph of this section will_
not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of 30% in principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes notify the Issuer of the Default and the Issuer does not cure such Default within
the time specified in such clauses after receipt of such notice. Any notice of Default under clauses (3),
(4), (5), (7) or (8) of the first paragraph of this section, notice of acceleration with respect to an Event
of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5), (7) or (8) of the first paragraph of this section or instruction to the
Trustee to provide a notice of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5), (7) or (8) of the first paragraph of this
section, notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5), (7) or (8)
of the first paragraph of this section or take any other action with respect to an alleged Default or Event
of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5), (7) or (8) of the first paragraph of this section (a “Noteholder
_Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each, a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied_
by a written representation from each such Holder to the Issuer and the Trustee that such Holder is not,
or, in the case such Holder is Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable, the “Relevant Clearing System”)
or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial
owners that are not, Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a
Noteholder Direction relating to a notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the
resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition,
each Directing Holder must, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, covenant to provide the
Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to
verify the accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of


-----

request thereof (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is the Relevant Clearing
System or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee, any Position Representation or Verification
Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of the
Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee.

**_Net Short Positions_**

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any
relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and the Issuer or the Company provides to the
Trustee (which shall be provided to the Noteholders) an Officer’s Certificate certifying that the Issuer
or the Company (i) believes in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder
was at any relevant time in breach of its Position Representation or its Verification Covenant and (ii)
has filed papers with a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing
Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation or its Verification Covenant, and
seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the
cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically stayed pending a final and nonappealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If such Officer’s
Certificate has been delivered to the Trustee, the Trustee shall refrain from acting in accordance with
such Noteholder Direction until such time as the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate
stating that (i) a Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant or (ii) a Directing Holder has
failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant or (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction rules that such
Directing Holder was, at such time, not in breach of its Position Representation or its Verification
Covenant, and during such time the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from
the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically stayed pending satisfaction of such
Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Directing
Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation
of such Directing Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such
Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such
Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed
never to have occurred, and any related acceleration rescinded, and the Trustee shall be deemed not to
have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such alleged Default or Event of Default,
shall not be permitted to act thereon and shall be restricted from accepting and acting on any future
Noteholder Direction in relation to such Event of Default. If the Directing Holder has satisfied its
Verification Covenant, then the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder
Direction. Notwithstanding the above, if such Directing Holder’s participation is not required to achieve
the requisite level of consent of Holders required under the Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction,
the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any
action taken or to be taken by the Issuer (as described above). The Trustee shall be entitled to rely
conclusively on any Noteholder Direction or Officer’s Certificate delivered to it in accordance with the
Indenture without verification, investigation or otherwise as to the statements made therein. The Trustee
may, but will not be obliged, to notify the Directing Holder and/or other Holders of the receipt of any
Officer’s Certificate provided by the Issuer received in relation to a Noteholder Direction. In no event
will the Trustee exercise any discretion with regard to its duties or responsibilities in respect of these
provisions.

Each Holder by accepting a Note acknowledges and agrees that the Trustee (and any agent) shall not
be liable to any party howsoever arising for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the
foregoing provisions, (ii) any Noteholder Direction, (iii) any Officer’s Certificate or (iv) its duties under
the Indenture, as the Trustee may determine in its sole discretion. The Trustee shall have no obligation
(i) to monitor, investigate, verify or otherwise determine if a Holder has Net Short position, (ii)
investigate the merits, validity, accuracy or authenticity of any Position Representation or Officer’s
Certificate, as the case may be, (iii) inquire if the Issuer will seek action to determine if a Directing
Holder has breached its Position Representation, (iv) enforce any Verification Covenant, (v) monitor
any court proceedings undertaken in connection therewith, (vi) monitor or investigate whether any


-----

Default or Event of Default has been publicly reported or (vii) otherwise make any calculations,
investigations or determinations with respect to any Derivative Instruments, Net Short position, Long
Derivative Instrument, Short Derivative Instrument or otherwise. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely
on its rights, protections and benefits under the Indenture at all times, including without limitation for
actions that are taken and subsequently stayed or annulled.

Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (5), (7) or (8) of the first
paragraph of this section, upon a valid Noteholder Direction, to accelerate the Notes, such principal of
and premium, if any, and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section, all
outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. A notice of Default,
notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration
or take any other action with respect to an alleged Default or Event of Default may not be given with
respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more than two years prior to such notice
or instruction. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any
continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest,
if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest.

The Indenture will provide, subject to the foregoing, that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of all the then outstanding Notes, by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all
of the Notes waive any existing Default and its consequences under the Indenture or the Security
Documents and rescind any acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences (except if such
rescission would conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and except a continuing
Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of, any Note held by a nonconsenting Holder).

In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) of the first paragraph of this section, such
Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as
a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without
any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 30 days after such Event of Default arose:

(1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged;

(2) the requisite number of holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or
action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or

(3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise
any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of the
Notes unless the Holders have offered to the Trustee and the Trustee has received indemnity and/or
security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to
receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due on or after the respective due dates
expressed in an outstanding Note, no Holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the
Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is
continuing and, if such Event of Default is in respect of clause (3), (4), (5), (7) or (8) of the first
paragraph of this section, such Holder is not in breach of a Position Representation or
Verification Covenant;

(2) Holders, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (5), (7) and (8) of the first paragraph of this section,
Directing Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant,
comprising at least 30% in the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have
requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;


-----

(3) Holders of the Notes have offered the Trustee and the Trustee has received indemnity and/or
security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the
offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) Holders comprising a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have not given
the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such written request within such 60 day period.

Subject to certain restrictions contained in the Indenture, including those described above, the Holders
of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time,
method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising
any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction
that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights
of any other Holder of a Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability, and may take any
other action that is not inconsistent with any such direction received from Holders of the Notes.

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement
regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuer is required, within 20 Business Days upon
becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default (unless
such Default has been cured or waived within such 20 Business Day time period).

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Managers, Officers, Members, Partners, Employees and**
**Equity Holders**

No past, present or future director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner or direct
or indirect equityholder of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiaries or of any of their direct or
indirect parent companies (other than in such equityholder’s capacity as the Issuer or a Guarantor) shall
have any liability, for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Guarantees
or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their
creation. Each Holder by accepting Notes waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release
are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive
liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against
public policy.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture with respect to a series of Notes,
the Notes of such series, the Guarantees of such series and the Security Documents with respect to such
series, as the case may be, will terminate (other than certain obligations) and will be released upon
payment in full of all of the Notes of such series. The Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to
have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the Notes of a series and have each Guarantor’s
obligation discharged with respect to its Guarantee of such series (“Legal Defeasance”) and cure all
then existing Defaults and Events of Default except for:

(1) the rights of Holders of Notes of such series to receive payments in respect of the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on the Notes of such series when such payments are due solely
out of the trust created pursuant to the Indenture;

(2) the Issuer’s obligations with respect to Notes of such series concerning issuing temporary
Notes, registration of such Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance
of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer’s obligations in
connection therewith; and


-----

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations and those of each
Guarantor released with respect to substantially all of the restrictive covenants that are described in the
Indenture with respect to a series of Notes (“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter any omission to
comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes
of such series. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including bankruptcy,
receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events pertaining to the Issuer) described under “—Events
_of Default and Remedies” will no longer constitute a Default or an Event of Default with respect to the_
Notes of such series.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to a series of Notes:

(1) the Issuer shall irrevocably deposit with the Trustee (or such entity designated (as agent) by the
Trustee for such purposes), in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes of such series,
cash in euro, euro-denominated Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amount
as will be sufficient, in the opinion of an Independent Financial Advisor, without consideration
of any reinvestment to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest due on such Notes on
the stated maturity date or on the redemption date, as the case may be, of such principal, premium,
if any, or interest on such Notes and the Issuer must specify whether such Notes are being
defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date; provided that upon any redemption that
requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for
purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the
Applicable Premium with respect to such series calculated as of the date of the notice of
redemption, with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any such amount, the “Applicable
_Premium Deficit”) only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of_
redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate
delivered to the Trustee simultaneously with the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that
confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions,

(a) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the United States Internal
Revenue Service a ruling, or

(b) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax
law,

in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that,
subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the beneficial owners of the Notes of such
series will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of
such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in
the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance
had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the beneficial owners
of the Notes of such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax
on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if
such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) no Event of Default (other than that resulting from borrowing funds to be applied to make such
deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each case,


-----

the granting of Liens in connection therewith) shall have occurred and be continuing on the date
of such deposit;

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture) to
which the Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer or any Guarantor is bound
(other than that resulting from any borrowing of funds to be applied to make the deposit required

Notes of such series which have been replaced or paid and Notes of such series for whose
payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust, have been delivered to the Trustee for

thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient without consideration of any reinvestment
to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes of such series not theretofore

interest to the date of maturity or redemption; provided that upon any redemption that
requires the payment of the Applicable Premium with respect to such series, the amount
deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount
is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date
of the notice of redemption, with any Applicable Premium Deficit only required to be

shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or shall occur as a
result of such deposit and such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than the
Indenture) to which the Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer or any
Guarantor is bound (other than resulting from any borrowing of funds to be applied to
make such deposit and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to other
Indebtedness and, in each case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith);

(c) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture with
respect to such series of Notes; and

of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) shall be required and (y) if any such amendment or
waiver by its terms will affect a series of Notes in a manner different and materially adverse relative to
the manner such amendment or waiver affects other series of Notes, then the consent of the Holders of
a majority in principal amount of the Notes of such series then outstanding (including, in each case,
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer, for Notes) shall
be required.

The Indenture will provide that, without the consent of at least 90% of affected Holders of the Notes,

that, taken together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Company for a
fiscal quarter end provided as required under “—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other
_Information”), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, in any manner materially adverse to_
the Holders of such Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of the Holders of at least 66⅔% in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, no amendment or waiver may (A) make any change in

modification from time to time of the Senior Facilities or any other agreement that is not
prohibited by the Indenture.

proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed
amendment.

_Repurchase at the Option of Holders” or “—Certain Covenants,” or action taken in compliance with_
the covenants in effect at the time of such action or in compliance with the second, third and fifth
paragraphs under the caption “Events of Default and Remedies”, shall be deemed to impair or affect

first date on which publication is made and notices given by first class mail, postage prepaid, will be

The Indenture will contain certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee thereunder, should it become
a creditor of the Issuer or a Guarantor, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on
certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be
permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it has actual knowledge it has acquired any
conflicting interest, it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign.

The Indenture will provide that the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding
Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture will provide that in case
an Event of Default shall occur (which shall not be cured) of which a responsible officer of the Trustee
has received written notice in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Trustee will be required,
in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent person in the conduct of his own
affairs. The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the
Indenture at the request of any Holder of the Notes, unless such Holder shall have offered to the Trustee
and the Trustee has received indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss,
liability or expense.

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange and for permission to be
granted to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the
application to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange will be approved or that permission to
deal in the Notes thereon will be granted, and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining
this listing or permission.

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A will
initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached
(the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Rule 144A Global Notes will be deposited upon
issuance with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common
depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

The Notes sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on
Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with
the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Regulation S Global Note
will be deposited upon issuance with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee
of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-entry Interests”) and ownership of
interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-entry Interests” and, together with
the 144A Book-entry Interests, the “Book-entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts
with Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Bookentry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained
in book-entry form by Euroclear and/or Clearstream and their participants. The Book-entry Interests in
Global Notes will only be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of
€1,000 in excess thereof.

The Book-entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s
account with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions,
including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take
physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability
to own, transfer or pledge Book-entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, owners
of interests in the Global Notes will not have the Notes registered in their names, will not receive
physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form (subject to very limited exceptions) and will not be
considered the registered owners or “holder” of the Notes under the Indenture for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
as applicable (or its respective nominee), will be considered the holder of the Notes for all purposes
under the Indenture. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
as applicable, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, and the participants through which they own Book-entry Interests in order to exercise any
rights of holders of the Notes under the Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Registrar, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Trustee or any of their
respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the
Book-entry Interests.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in
registered form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”):

(1) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days;

(2) if Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an Event of Default under the Indenture; or


-----

(3) if the owner of a Book-entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through
Euroclear or Clearstream following an Event of Default under the Indenture.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that upon request by an owner of a Book-entry Interest
described in the immediately preceding clause (3), their current procedure is to request that we issue or
cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-entry Interests.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions
received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-entry Interests), and such
Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that
legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

In the case of the issue of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may
transfer such Definitive Registered Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial
transfer or a partial redemption of one Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note
will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note
will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable, in respect of the balance of the holding not
transferred or redeemed; _provided that a Definitive Registered Note will only be issued in_
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered
Notes have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are
mutilated and are surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of the applicable Transfer Agent, we will
issue and the Trustee or an authenticating agent appointed by the Trustee will authenticate a replacement
Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and our requirements are met. We or the Trustee may require
a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient
in the judgment of both the Trustee and us to protect us, the Trustee and the applicable Paying Agent
appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive
Registered Note is replaced. We and/or the Trustee may charge for expenses in replacing a Definitive
Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about
to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions
of the Indenture, we in our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay,
redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-entry Interests only in
accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the applicable
Transfer Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such
transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar
and any of their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as
the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such.
Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the registered
office of the Issuer, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Bookentry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts
in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable.


-----

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the
holders of the Book-entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the
redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of
such Book-entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer
understands that under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes
are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, will credit their respective
participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on
such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate in accordance with their respective operational
procedures; provided, however, that no Book-entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount at
maturity may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest,
additional interest and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuer to the Paying Agents. The Paying
Agents will, in turn, make such payments to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, which will
distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective procedures.

Under the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the
Transfer Agent, the Registrar and any of their respective agents will treat the registered holder of the
Global Notes (for example, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or their respective nominees)
as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently,
none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent, the Paying Agent nor any of their
respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspects of the records of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or
indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-entry Interest, for any
such payments made by Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or
indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments
made on account of, a Book-entry Interest;

- payments made by Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect
participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect participant relating to or payments
made on account of a Book-entry Interest;

- Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or indirect participant; or

- the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers
registered in “street name.”

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any
regulations of the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the
Initial Purchasers, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor any of their respective agents
will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or
expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection
with any such payment. Holders may be subject to foreign exchange risks that may have economic and
tax consequences to them.


-----

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the
Global Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in
euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken
by a holder of the Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Bookentry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such
direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents,
waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event
of default under the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global
Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered
Notes to their respective participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, will be done in accordance
with Euroclear and Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder
requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Notes to
persons in states which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such
holder must transfer its interest in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice to Investors.” Book-entry Interests
in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Notice to Investors.”

Beneficial interests in a 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note denominated in the same currency only
upon receipt by the Trustee of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) from the
transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 or
any other exemption (if available under the Securities Act).

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Notice to Investors,” Book-entry Interests may be
transferred and exchanged as described under “Description of Notes—Transfer and Exchange.” Any
Book-entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a Book-entry Interest in the other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer,
cease to be a Book-entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-entry Interest
in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any,
and other procedures applicable to Book-entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it
retains such a Book-entry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-entry Interests in a Global
Note only as described under “Description of Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if
the transferor first delivers to the Trustee and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form provided in
the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions
applicable to such notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
as applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely
for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are


-----

controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Initial
Purchasers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor any of their respective
agents are responsible for those operations or procedures.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations, they also facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through
electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide
various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement,
lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with
domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as
underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations.
Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers
and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and
Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such
interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or
otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for
that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of
securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may
be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will
receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream
participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed and admitted to trading on the
Official List of the Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in
Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective
system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes amongst participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such
procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial
Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar, the Paying Agent nor any of their respective
agents will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants
or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their
operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in
registered form. Book-entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear
and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value
on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in
same day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the
time of trading of any Book-entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are
located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.


-----

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are
open for business.


-----

**TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

_If you are a prospective investor, you should consult your tax advisor as to the possible tax_
_consequences of purchasing, holding or selling any Notes under the laws of your country of citizenship,_
_residence or domicile, including the effect of any local taxes applicable to you. The discussions that_
_follow do not purport to be a comprehensive description of all tax considerations that may be relevant_
_to a decision to purchase, hold or sell Notes. In particular, these discussions do not consider any_
_specific facts or circumstances that may apply to you. The discussions that follow for each jurisdiction_
_are based upon the applicable laws and interpretations thereof as in effect as of the date of this Offering_
_Memorandum. These tax laws and interpretations are subject to change, possibly with retroactive or_
_retrospective effect._

**Certain Luxembourg Tax Considerations**

The following information is of a general nature and is included herein solely for preliminary
information purposes. It is a summary of certain material Luxembourg tax consequences of purchasing,
owning and disposing of the Notes. It does not purport to be a complete analysis of all possible tax
situations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase, own or dispose of the Notes. It is included
herein solely for preliminary information purposes. It is not intended to be, nor should it construed to
be, legal or tax advice. This summary does not allow any conclusion to be drawn with respect to issues
not specifically addressed. The following description of Luxembourg tax law is based on the
Luxembourg law and regulations as in effect and as interpreted by the Luxembourg tax authorities on
the date of the Offering Memorandum. These laws and interpretations are subject to change that may
occur after such date, even with retroactive or retrospective effect.

Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their own tax advisers as to the particular tax
consequences of subscribing, purchasing, holding and disposing the Notes, including the application
and effect of any federal, state or local taxes under the tax laws of Luxembourg and each country of
which they are tax residents or citizens.

Please be aware that the residence concept used under the respective headings below applies for
Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes only. Any reference in the present section to a tax, duty,
levy impost or other charge or withholding of a similar nature refers to Luxembourg tax law and/or
concepts only. Also, please note that a reference to Luxembourg income tax encompasses corporate
income tax (impôt sur le revenu des collectivités), municipal business tax (impôt commercial
_communal), a solidarity surcharge (contribution au fonds pour l’emploi) as well as personal income tax_
(impôt sur le revenu). A corporate taxpayer may further be subject to net wealth tax (impôt sur la
_fortune), as well as other duties, levies or taxes. Corporate income tax, municipal business tax as well_
as the solidarity surcharge invariably apply to most corporate taxpayers resident in Luxembourg for tax
purposes. Individual taxpayers are generally subject to personal income tax and a solidarity surcharge.
Under certain circumstances, where an individual taxpayer acts in the course of the management of a
professional or business undertaking, municipal business tax may apply as well.

**_Tax Residency_**

Holders of Notes will not become resident nor be deemed to be resident, in Luxembourg by reason only
of the holding of the Notes or the execution, performance, delivery and/or enforcement of their rights
thereunder.

**_Withholding Tax_**

_Luxembourg Tax Resident Holders of Notes_

Under the Luxembourg law dated 23 December 2005, as amended (the “Law”), a 20 per cent.
Luxembourg withholding tax is levied on interest or similar income payments made by Luxembourg
paying agents to or for the immediate benefit of an individual beneficial owner who is resident in


-----

Luxembourg. This withholding tax also applies on accrued interest received upon disposal, redemption
or repurchase of the Notes. Such withholding tax will be in full discharge of income tax if the beneficial
owner is an individual acting in the course of the management of his or her private wealth.
Responsibility for the withholding of tax in application of the Law is assumed by the Luxembourg
paying agent within the meaning of the Law.

Further, Luxembourg resident individuals acting in the course of the management of their private
wealth, who are the beneficial owners of interest payments and other similar income made by a paying
agent established outside Luxembourg in a member state of the EU or a Member State of the EEA may
opt for a final 20 per cent. levy. In such case, the 20 per cent. levy is calculated on the same amounts as
for the payments made by Luxembourg paying agents. The option for the 20 per cent. final levy must
cover all interest payments made by paying agents to the beneficial owner during the entire civil year.

_Non-Luxembourg Tax Resident Holders of Notes. Under the Luxembourg tax law currently in effect,_
there is no withholding tax on payments of interest (including accrued but unpaid interest) made to a
Luxembourg non-resident holder of Notes. There is also no Luxembourg withholding tax upon
repayment of the principal, sale, refund or redemption of the Notes.

**_Taxation of the Holders of Notes—Income Tax_**

_Resident Holders of Notes_

_General_

Luxembourg Tax Resident Holders of Notes or non-Luxembourg tax resident Holders of Notes who
have a permanent establishment, a fixed place of business or a permanent representative in Luxembourg
to which the Notes are attributable, must, for income tax purposes, include any interest paid or accrued
in their taxable income. Specific exemptions may be available for certain taxpayers benefiting from a
particular status.

_Luxembourg Tax Resident Individuals._

An individual holder of Notes, acting in the course of the management of his or her private wealth, is
subject to Luxembourg income tax in respect of interest received, redemption premiums or issue
discounts under the Notes, except if a final withholding tax has been levied on such payments or, in
case of a non-Luxembourg tax resident paying agent, if such holder of Notes has opted for a 20% levy,
in accordance with the Law.

Under Luxembourg domestic tax law, gains realised upon the sale, disposal or redemption of the Notes
by an individual holder of Notes, who is a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes and who acts in the
course of the management of his or her private wealth, are not subject to Luxembourg income tax,
provided this sale or disposal took place more than six months after the acquisition of the Notes and the
Notes do not constitute zero coupon notes. However, any portion of such gain corresponding to accrued
but unpaid interest income is subject to Luxembourg income tax, except if tax has been levied on such
interest in accordance with the Law.

An individual holder of Notes, who acts in the course of the management of his or her private wealth
and who is a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes, must further include the portion of the gain
corresponding to accrued but unpaid interest income in respect of the Notes in his or her taxable income,
insofar as the accrued but unpaid interest is indicated separately in the agreement, except if a final
withholding tax or levy has been levied in accordance with the Law.

Luxembourg tax resident individual holders of Notes acting in the course of the management of a
professional or business undertaking to which the Notes are attributable, must include any interest
received or accrued, as well as any gain realised on the sale or disposal of the Notes, in any form
whatsoever, in their taxable income for Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes. Taxable gains


-----

are defined as the difference between the sale, repurchase or redemption price (including accrued but
unpaid interest) and the lower of the cost or book value of the Notes sold, repurchased or redeemed.

_Luxembourg Tax Resident Companies. Luxembourg corporate holders of Notes must include any_
interest received or accrued, as well as any gain realised on the sale or disposal of the Notes, in their
taxable income for Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes. Taxable gains are defined as the
difference between the sale, repurchase or redemption price (including but unpaid interest) and the
lower of the cost or book value of the Notes sold or redeemed.

_Luxembourg Tax Resident Companies Benefiting from a Special Tax Regime. Luxembourg holders of_
Notes who benefit from a special tax regime, such as, for example, (i) undertakings for collective
investment subject to the amended law of 17 December 2010, (ii) specialised investment funds governed
by the amended law of 13 February 2007, (iii) family wealth management companies governed by the
amended law of 11 May 2007, or (iv) reserved alternative investment funds treated as specialised
investment funds for Luxembourg tax purposes governed by the amended law of 23 July 2016 are
exempt from income taxes in Luxembourg and thus income derived from the Notes, as well as gains
realised thereon, are not subject to income taxes.

_Non-Luxembourg Tax Resident Holders of Notes_

Holders of Notes who are non-Luxembourg tax residents and who have neither a permanent
establishment nor a permanent representative in Luxembourg to which or whom the Notes are
attributable are not liable to pay any Luxembourg income tax, irrespective of whether they receive
payments of principal or interest (including accrued but unpaid interest) or realise capital gains upon
redemption, repurchase, sale, disposal or exchange, in any form whatsoever, of any Notes.

Holders of Notes who are non-Luxembourg tax residents and who have a permanent establishment or
a permanent representative in Luxembourg to which or whom the Notes are attributable are liable to
pay Luxembourg income tax on any interest received or accrued, as well as any reimbursement premium
received at maturity and any capital gain realised on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the
Notes and must include this income in their taxable income for Luxembourg income tax assessment
purposes.

**_Taxation of the Holders of Notes—Net Wealth Tax_**

Luxembourg tax resident holders of Notes and non-Luxembourg tax resident holders of Notes who have
a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in Luxembourg to which or whom the Notes
are attributable, are subject to Luxembourg net wealth tax on such Notes, except if the holder of Notes
is (i) an individual, (ii) an undertaking for collective investment subject to the amended law of 17
December 2010, (iii), a securitisation company governed by the amended law of 22 March 2004, (iv) a
company governed by the amended law of 15 June 2004 on venture capital vehicles, (v) a specialised
investment fund governed by the amended law of 13 February 2007, (vi) a family wealth management
company governed by the amended law of 11 May 2007, (vii) a professional pension institution
governed by the amended law of 13 July 2005, or (viii) a reserved alternative investment fund governed
by the amended law of 23 July 2016.

However, (i) a securitisation company governed by the amended law of 22 March 2004 on
securitisation, (ii) a company governed by the amended law of 15 June 2004 on venture capital vehicles
(iii) a professional pension institution governed by the amended law dated 13 July 2005 and (iv) an
opaque reserved alternative investment fund treated as a venture capital vehicle governed by the
amended law of 23 July 2016 remain subject to minimum net wealth tax of €4,815, if they hold assets
such as fixed financial assets, receivables owed to affiliated companies, transferable securities, postal
checking accounts, checks and cash, in a proportion that exceeds 90 % of their total balance sheet value
and if the total financial assets value exceeds €350,000 or (b) to a minimum net wealth tax between
€535 and €32,100 based on their total balance sheet.


-----

**_Taxation of the Holders of Notes—Other Taxes_**

Under Luxembourg tax laws as of today's day and administrative practice as of today's date, there is no
Luxembourg registration tax, stamp duty or any other similar tax or duty payable in Luxembourg by
the holders of Notes as a consequence of the issuance of the Notes, nor will any of these taxes be payable
as a consequence of a subsequent transfer, redemption or repurchase of the Notes (except in case of
voluntary registration in Luxembourg or if the Notes are appended to a deed which is mandatorily
subject to registration or are lodged with the notary for his records (déposé au rang des minutes d’un
_notaire)._

In case of registration, such registration will be made with the Administration de l'Enregistrement, des
_Domaines et de la TVA. The Administration de l'Enregistrement, des Domaines et de la TVA (i) will_
apply and collect a fixed or ad valorem registration tax depending on the nature of the obligations, deeds
(actes) and transfers (mutations) referred to in the above mentioned documents and (ii) may also require
that all or part of the registered documents be translated into French or German.

Under Luxembourg tax law, where an individual holder of Notes is a resident of Luxembourg for
inheritance tax purposes at the time of his or her death, the Notes are included in his or her taxable base
for inheritance tax purposes. On the contrary, no estate or inheritance taxes are levied on the transfer of
the Notes upon death of a holder of Notes in cases where the deceased was not a resident of Luxembourg
for inheritance tax purposes at the time of his or her death. Luxembourg gift tax may be due on a gift
or donation of the Notes if the gift is recorded in a deed executed before a Luxembourg notary or
otherwise registered in Luxembourg.

There is no Luxembourg value added tax payable in respect of payments in consideration for the
issuance of the Notes or in respect of the payment of interest or principal under the Notes or the transfer
of the Notes.

**Exchange of Information**

_FATCA_

Capitalised terms used in this section should have the meaning as set forth in the FATCA Law (as
defined below), unless otherwise provided herein.

The Issuer is subject to the so-called FATCA legislation which generally requires reporting to the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service of non-U.S. financial institutions that do not comply with FATCA and direct
or indirect ownership by U.S. persons of non-U.S. entities. As part of the process of implementing
FATCA, the U.S. government has negotiated intergovernmental agreements with certain foreign
jurisdictions which are intended to streamline reporting and compliance requirements for entities
established in such foreign jurisdictions and subject to FATCA.

Luxembourg has entered into a Model 1 Intergovernmental Agreement implemented by the
Luxembourg law of 24 July 2015, as amended or supplemented from time to time (the “FATCA Law”),
which requires Financial Institutions located in Luxembourg to report, when required, information on
Financial Accounts held by Specified U.S. Persons (as defined under the FATCA Law), if any, to the
Luxembourg tax authorities (administration des contributions directes).

Under the terms of the FATCA Law, the Issuer is treated as a Luxembourg Reporting Financial
Institution.

This status imposes on the Issuer the obligation to regularly obtain and verify information on all of the
holders of Notes. On the request of the Issuer, each holder of Notes shall agree to provide certain
information, including, in the case of a passive Non-Financial Foreign Entity (“NFFE”), information
on the Controlling Persons of such NFFE, along with the required supporting documentation. Similarly,


-----

each holder of Notes shall agree to actively provide to the Issuer within 30 days any information that
would affect its status, as for instance a new mailing address or a new residency address.

The FATCA Law may require the Issuer to disclose the names, addresses and taxpayer identification
number (if available) of the holders of Notes as well as information such as account balances, income
and gross proceeds (non-exhaustive list) to the Luxembourg tax authorities for the purposes set out in
the FATCA Law. Such information will be relayed by the Luxembourg tax authorities to the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service.

Holders of Notes qualifying as passive NFFEs undertake to inform their Controlling Persons, if
applicable, of the processing of their information by the Issuer.

Additionally, the Issuer is responsible for the processing of personal data and each holder of Notes has
a right to access the data communicated to the Luxembourg tax authorities and to correct such data (if
necessary). Any data obtained by the Issuer is to be processed in accordance with the applicable data
protection legislation.

Although the Issuer will attempt to satisfy any obligation imposed on it to avoid imposition of FATCA
withholding tax, no assurance can be given that the Issuer will be able to satisfy these obligations. If
the Issuer becomes subject to a withholding tax or penalties as result of the FATCA regime, the value
of the Notes held by the holders of Notes may suffer material losses. The failure for the Issuer to obtain
such information from each holder of Notes and to transmit it to the Luxembourg tax authorities may
trigger the 30 per cent. withholding tax to be imposed on payments of U.S. source income as well as
penalties.

Any holder of Notes that fails to comply with the Issuer’s documentation requests may be charged with
any taxes and/or penalties imposed on the Issuer as a result of such holder’s failure to provide the
information and the Issuer may, in its sole discretion, redeem the Notes of such holder of Notes.

Holders of Notes who invest through intermediaries are reminded to check if and how their
intermediaries will comply with this U.S. withholding tax and reporting regime.

Holders of Notes should consult a U.S. tax advisor or otherwise seek professional advice regarding the
above requirements.

_Common Reporting Standard_

Capitalised terms used in this section should have the meaning as set forth in the CRS Law (as defined
below), unless otherwise provided herein.

The Issuer is subject to the Common Reporting Standard as set out in the Luxembourg law of 18
December 2015, as amended or supplemented from time to time (the “CRS Law”) implementing
Directive 2014/107/EU which provides for an automatic exchange of financial account information
between Member States of the EU as well as the OECD’s multilateral competent authority agreement
on automatic exchange of financial account information signed on 29 October 2014 in Berlin, with
effect as of 1 January 2016.

Under the terms of the CRS Law, the Issuer is treated as a Luxembourg Reporting Financial Institution.

As such, the Issuer will be required to annually report to the Luxembourg tax authorities personal and
financial information related, inter alia, to the identification of, holdings by and payments made to (i)
certain holders of Notes qualifying as Reportable Persons (as defined in the CRS Law) and (ii)
Controlling Persons of passive non-financial entities (“NFEs”) which are themselves Reportable
Persons. This information, as exhaustively set out in Annex I of the CRS Law (the “Information”), will
include personal data related to the Reportable Persons.


-----

The Issuer’s ability to satisfy its reporting obligations under the CRS Law will depend on each holder
of Notes providing the Issuer with the Information, along with the required supporting documentary
evidence. In this context, the holders of Notes are hereby informed that, as data controller, the Issuer
will process the Information for the purposes as set out in the CRS Law.

Holders of Notes qualifying as passive NFEs undertake to inform their Controlling Persons, if
applicable, of the processing of their Information by the Issuer.

Additionally, the Issuer is responsible for the processing of personal data and each holder of Notes has
a right to access the data communicated to the Luxembourg tax authorities and to correct such data (if
necessary). Any data obtained by the Issuer are to be processed in accordance with the applicable data
protection legislation.

The holders of Notes are further informed that the Information related to Reportable Persons will be
disclosed to the Luxembourg tax authorities annually for the purposes set out in the CRS Law. The
Luxembourg tax authorities will, under their own responsibility, eventually exchange the reported
information to the competent authority of the Reportable Jurisdiction(s). In particular, Reportable
Persons are informed that certain operations performed by them will be reported to them through the
issuance of statements, and that part of this information will serve as a basis for the annual disclosure
to the Luxembourg tax authorities.

Similarly, the holders of Notes undertake to inform the Issuer within 30 days of receipt of these
statements should any included personal data not be accurate. The holders of Notes further undertake
to immediately inform the Issuer of, and provide the Issuer with all supporting documentary evidence
of any changes related to the Information after occurrence of such changes.

Although the Issuer will attempt to satisfy any obligation imposed on it to avoid any fines or penalties
imposed by the CRS Law, no assurance can be given that the Issuer will be able to satisfy these
obligations. If the Issuer becomes subject to a fine or penalty as a result of the CRS Law, the value of
the Notes held by the holders of Notes may suffer material losses.

Any holder of Notes that fails to comply with the Issuer’s Information or documentation requests may
be held liable for penalties imposed on the Issuer as a result of such holder’s failure to provide the
Information or subject to disclosure of the Information by the Issuer to the Luxembourg tax authorities
and the Issuer may, in its sole discretion, redeem the Notes of such holder of Notes.

**Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes issued pursuant to this offering, but does not purport to be a
complete analysis of all potential tax considerations. The discussion is limited to considerations relevant
to a U.S. Holder (as defined below), except to the extent discussed in “—Additional Notes” and “—
_Foreign Account Tax Compliance,” and does not address the effects of other U.S. federal tax laws, such_
as estate and gift tax laws, or any state, local or foreign tax laws. This discussion is based on the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder
(“Treasury Regulations”), judicial decisions, and published rulings and administrative pronouncements
of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), in each case in effect as of the date hereof. These
authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations. Any such change or differing
interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could adversely affect a holder of the Notes.
We have not sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS regarding the matters discussed below.
There can be no assurance the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position to that discussed below
regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

This discussion is limited to holders who hold the Notes as “capital assets” within the meaning of
Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). In addition, this discussion is limited


-----

to persons purchasing the Notes for cash at original issue and at their original “issue price” within the
meaning of Section 1273 of the Code (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is
sold to the public for cash). This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax consequences
relevant to a holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the Medicare contribution tax
on net investment income. In addition, it does not address consequences relevant to holders subject to
special rules, including, without limitation:

- U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;

- persons liable for the alternative minimum tax;

- U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

- persons holding the Notes as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part
of a conversion transaction or other integrated investment;

- persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with
respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement;

- banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions;

- real estate investment trusts and regulated investment companies;

- brokers, dealers and traders in securities;

- “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies,” and corporations
that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;

- S corporations, partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S.
federal income tax purposes (and investors therein);

- tax-exempt organizations and governmental organizations; and

- persons deemed to sell the Notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, is:

- an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

- a corporation, or an entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created
or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;

- an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or

- a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and the control of one or
more “United States persons” (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code), or (2)
has a valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes,
the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of
the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, partnerships holding
the Notes and the partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S.
federal income tax consequences to them.

THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE.
INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE
APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO THEIR PARTICULAR
SITUATIONS AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP
AND DISPOSITION OF THE NOTES ARISING UNDER OTHER U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS
(INCLUDING THE MEDICARE CONTRIBUTION TAX ON NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND
ESTATE AND GIFT TAX LAWS), UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S.
TAXING JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATY.

**_Characterization of the Notes_**

We may be required to pay additional amounts if certain taxes are withheld or deducted from payments
on the Notes (as described under “Description of Notes—Withholding Taxes”) or make additional
payments in redemption of the Notes in addition to their stated principal amount and accrued interest
(as described under “Description of Notes—Change of Control Triggering Event”). Although the issue
is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of paying such additional
amounts, or making additional payments in redemption of the Note, does not result in the Notes being
treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury Regulations. This
position will be based in part on our determination that, as of the date of the issuance of the Notes, the
possibility that additional amounts will have to be paid is a remote or incidental contingency within the
meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations.

Our determination that the Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a U.S.
Holder, unless the U.S. Holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which
such U.S. Holder acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not
binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a position contrary to that described above, a U.S. Holder may be
required to accrue interest income on its Notes based upon a comparable yield, regardless of its method
of accounting. The “comparable yield” is the yield at which we would issue a fixed rate debt instrument
with no contingent payments, but with terms and conditions otherwise similar to those of the Notes. In
addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Notes generally
would be recharacterised as ordinary income. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor
regarding the tax consequences of the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The
remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt
instruments.

**_Effect of the IPO Pushdown Provisions_**

In the event that the Issuer of the Notes changes as a result of the provisions described under
“Description of Notes—IPO Pushdown,” such change in the Issuer could result in a deemed exchange
of the Notes for “new” Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event, U.S. Holders
generally would recognize any gain on such exchange (although any loss could be disallowed), and the
Notes could be treated as issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below with respect to the Notes, payments of stated
interest on a Note (including any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes and without
reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at
the time that such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. Holder’s method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Payments of interest on the Notes will be denominated in euro. If you use the cash method of accounting
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income)
the U.S. dollar value of the interest received on the Notes, determined by translating the euro received
at the spot rate on the date such payment is received regardless of whether the payment is in fact
converted into U.S. dollars. You will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of


-----

such payment, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euros
so received.

If you use the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or you are otherwise
required to accrue interest prior to receipt), you may determine the amount of income recognized with
respect to interest received on the Notes in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first
method, you will be required to include in income for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the
interest that has accrued during such year, determined by translating such interest at the average rate of
exchange for the period or periods during which such interest accrued or, in the case of an accrual period
that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within the taxable year. Under the
second method, you may elect to translate interest income at the spot rate on:

- the last day of the accrual period;

- the last day of the portion of the accrual period within the applicable taxable year if the accrual
period straddles your taxable year; or

- the date the stated interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the
end of the accrual period.

This election will apply to all debt obligations you hold from year to year and cannot be changed without
the consent of the IRS. You should consult your own tax advisor as to the advisability of making the
above election.

Whether or not such election is made, upon receipt of an interest payment on a Note (including, upon
the sale of a Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid
interest previously included in income), you will recognize U.S. source ordinary income or loss in an
amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by
translating the euros received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar
value of the interest income you previously included in income with respect to such payment. This
exchange gain or loss will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a U.S. Holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible
for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject
to applicable limitations. Stated interest income on a Note generally will constitute foreign source
income and generally will be considered “passive category income” in computing the foreign tax credit.
The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules that depend on a U.S.
Holder’s particular circumstances. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the
creditability or deductibility of any withholding taxes.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder
generally will recognize U.S. source gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount
realized upon such disposition (less any amount attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which
will be taxable as such to the extent not previously included in income as described above under “—
_Payments of Stated Interest”) and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. A U.S. Holder’s_
adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the cost of the Note to such U.S. Holder.

The amount realized by a U.S. Holder is the sum of the cash plus the fair market value of all other
property received on the sale or other taxable disposition. If a U.S. Holder receives foreign currency on
such sale or other taxable disposition, the amount realized will generally be based on the U.S. dollar
value of such foreign currency translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of disposition. In the
case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S.
Holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. Holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of foreign
currency by translating such amount at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the


-----

disposition. The special election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders in regard to the purchase or
disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt
instruments held by the U.S. Holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual
basis U.S. Holder that does not make the special election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the
extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date,
and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss. A U.S. Holder’s
adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally be its cost for the Note. The cost of a Note purchased with
foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price determined based on the spot rate
on the date of purchase. If the applicable Note is treated as traded on an established securities market
and the relevant U.S. Holder is either a cash basis taxpayer or an accrual basis taxpayer who has made
the special election described above, such U.S. Holder will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost
of such Note by translating the amount paid at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the
purchase. The conversion of U.S. dollars to a foreign currency and the immediate use of that currency
to purchase a Note generally will not result in taxable gain or loss for a U.S. Holder.

Gain or loss recognized on the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to
fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note generally will
be U.S. source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as interest income or expense.
Such gain or loss generally will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S.
Holder’s euro purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date principal
is received from the Issuer or the U.S. Holder disposes of the Note, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S.
Holder’s euro purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date the U.S.
Holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon a sale or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S.
Holder may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued
and unpaid stated interest, which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated
_Interest.” However, upon a sale or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder will recognize any_
exchange gain or loss (including with respect to accrued stated interest) only to the extent of total gain
or loss realized by such U.S. Holder on such disposition.

Gain or loss a U.S. Holder recognizes on the sale or other taxable disposition of the Notes in excess of
exchange gain or loss attributable to such disposition generally will be U.S. source capital gain or loss.
Such gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if a U.S. Holder has held the Notes for
more than one year. For non-corporate U.S. Holders, long-term capital gains are generally eligible for
reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. A U.S. Holder
should consult its own tax advisor regarding the deductibility of capital losses in its particular
circumstances.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of interest on the Notes and to
the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a redemption or retirement) of a Note paid to a
U.S. Holder, unless such U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient and, when required, provides evidence of
such exemption. A U.S. Holder that is not an exempt recipient may be subject to U.S. federal backup
withholding at the applicable rate with respect to payments on the Notes and the proceeds of a sale or
other taxable disposition of the Notes, unless the U.S. Holder provides its taxpayer identification
number to the respective Paying Agent and certifies on IRS Form W-9, under penalties of perjury, that
it is not subject to backup withholding and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the
backup withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup
withholding withheld from a payment to a U.S. Holder may be allowed as a credit against such U.S.
Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle such U.S. Holder to a refund, provided the
required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner.


-----

**_Additional Notes_**

The Issuer may issue Additional Notes, as described under “Description of Notes.” These Additional
Notes, even if they are treated for non-tax purposes as part of the same series as the original Notes, in
some cases may be treated as a separate series for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such case, the
Additional Notes may be considered to have been issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, which may adversely affect the market value of the original Notes if the Additional
Notes are not otherwise distinguishable from the original Notes.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirement_**

Treasury Regulations require the reporting to the IRS of certain foreign currency transactions giving
rise to losses in excess of a certain minimum amount, such as the receipt or accrual of interest on or a
sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign
currency received in respect of a foreign currency note. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors
to determine the tax return disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes,
including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

Individuals that own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess of certain
thresholds generally are required to file an information report with respect to such assets with their tax
returns on IRS Form 8938 (Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets). Failure to file IRS Form
8938 may subject the holder to substantial penalties, and the statute of limitations on the assessment
and collection of all U.S. federal income taxes of such holder for the related tax year may not close
before the date which is three years after the date on which such report is filed. The Notes generally
will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting requirements, unless the
Notes are held in an account at certain financial institutions. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax
advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure requirements to their ownership of the
Notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance. Under certain circumstances, an entity
may be treated as an individual for purposes of these rules.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance_**

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”), a
“foreign financial institution” may be required to withhold U.S. tax on certain “foreign passthru
_payments” made after 31 December 2018 to the extent such payments are treated as attributable to_
certain U.S. source payments. Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date
on which applicable final Treasury Regulations defining foreign passthru payments are filed with the
Federal Register generally would be “grandfathered” from FATCA unless “materially modified” (for
U.S. federal income tax purposes) after such date. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign
financial institution, FATCA would apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant
modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after expiration of the grandfather
period. However, if Additional Notes are issued after the expiration of the grandfather period in other
than a “qualified reopening” (as defined in applicable Treasury Regulations) and are not distinguishable
from the original Notes, then withholding agents may treat both the original Notes and Additional Notes
as subject to withholding under FATCA. Non-U.S. governments have entered into agreements with the
United States (and additional non-U.S. governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to
implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. Under such intergovernmental
agreements, the Issuer may be required to report certain information regarding investors to tax
authorities in a non-U.S. jurisdiction, which information may be shared with taxing authorities in the
United States. Holders should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their
investment in the Notes. In the event any withholding under FATCA is required or advisable with
respect to any payments on the Notes, there generally will be no additional amounts payable to
compensate for the withheld amount.


-----

**Payments by a Guarantor**

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on the Notes, it is possible that such payments
may be subject to withholding tax at applicable rates subject to such relief as may be available under
the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty or to any other exemption which may apply. If
such payments are subject to withholding or deduction, the Guarantor may be required to pay additional
amounts so that the net amount received is no less than the amount which would have been received in
the absence of such withholding or deduction (subject to certain exceptions) as described under
“Description of Notes—Withholding Taxes.”

**Certain Italian Income Tax Considerations—Payments made by a Guarantor resident in Italy**

With respect to payments on the Notes made to certain Italian resident Noteholders by a Guarantor
resident in Italy, in accordance with an interpretation of Italian tax law, any payment of liabilities equal
to interest and other proceeds from the Notes may be subject to a provisional or final withholding tax
at a rate of 26 per cent. pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 600 of 29 September 1973, as subsequently
amended.

In case of payments to non-Italian resident Noteholders made by a Guarantor resident in Italy, the
withholding tax may be applied as a final tax. Double taxation treaties entered into by Italy may apply
allowing for a lower (on, in certain cases, nil) rate of withholding tax. In the event such withholding tax
is imposed, the Guarantor resident in Italy may be required to pay additional amounts so that the net
amount received is no less than the amount which would have been received in the absence of such
withholding tax (subject to certain exceptions) as described under “Description of Notes—Withholding
_Taxes.”_

According to another interpretation of Italian tax law, payments in lieu of interest made by a Guarantor
resident in Italy may be subject to the same regime applicable to the payment of interest made by the
Issuer under the Notes, hence benefiting from an exemption from withholding tax in case certain
requirements are met.


-----

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuer intends to offer the Notes through the Initial Purchasers, namely, Deutsche Bank AG,
London Branch, BofA Securities Europe SA, Bank of China Limited, London Branch, Barclays Bank
PLC, Blackstone Holdings Finance Co. L.L.C., HSBC Bank PLC, Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A., Mizuho
Securities Europe GmbH, Banco Santander, S.A., SMBC Nikko Capital Markets Limited and UniCredit
Bank AG.

Each of the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers will enter into a purchase agreement to be
dated the date of the final Offering Memorandum (the “Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which the
Issuer will have agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers will have agreed,
severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Issuer, the entire principal amount of the Notes. The
obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, in addition to their agreement to
purchase the Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Notes are subject to, amongst other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by
their counsel.

The Notes will initially be offered at the respective prices indicated on the cover page of this Offering
Memorandum. After the initial offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may
from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. The Initial Purchasers may make
offers and sales in the United States through certain of their respective affiliates. The Initial Purchasers
reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in
part. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates or through
registered broker dealers.

To the extent that any Initial Purchaser that is not a U.S. registered broker dealer intends to effect any
sales of Notes in the United States, it will do so through one or more U.S. registered broker dealer
affiliates or U.S. registered broker dealers as permitted by guidelines promulgated by the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuer and each Guarantor will indemnify the Initial
Purchasers against certain liabilities, including certain liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will
contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof.

We have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the
Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuer that are substantially similar
to the Notes during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date
falling 40 days after the closing of the Offering without the prior written consent of Deutsche Bank AG,
London Branch.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers
have agreed that they will only offer or sell the Notes (i) in the United States to qualified institutional
buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act, and (ii) outside the United States to
non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act;
_provided that investors resident in a Member State of the European Economic Area or the United_
Kingdom are not retail investors (as defined herein). Terms used above have the meanings given to
them by Rule 144A and Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act.

In connection with sales outside the United States, the Initial Purchasers will not offer, sell or deliver
the Notes to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (i) as part of the Initial Purchasers’
distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the
Offering or the date the Notes are originally issued. The Initial Purchasers will send to each distributor,
dealer or person to whom it sells such Notes during such 40-day period a confirmation or other notice


-----

setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the United States or to, or for the
account or benefit of, U.S. persons.

In addition, with respect to Notes initially sold pursuant to Regulation S, until 40 days after the later of
the commencement of this Offering or the date the Notes are originally issued, an offer or sale of such
Notes within the United States by a dealer that is not participating in the Offering may violate the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented that it (i) has only communicated or caused to be communicated
and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in
investment activity, within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA, received by it in connection with
the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to
the Issuer and (ii) has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect
to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

**General**

**_New Issue of Notes_**

The Notes and the Guarantees are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market.
Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the
Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Official
List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such listing will
be maintained. The Initial Purchasers (or persons acting on their behalf) have advised the Issuer that
they currently intend to make a market in the Notes. However, the Initial Purchasers are not obligated
to do so, and may discontinue any market-making activities with respect to the Notes at any time without
notice. In addition, market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities
Act and the U.S. Exchange Act, and may be limited. Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to the
liquidity of or the trading market for the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our
_Structure—The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Official List of the Exchange.”_

**_Price Stabilization and Short Positions_**

In connection with the issue of the Notes, the Stabilisation Manager, or persons acting on its behalf,
may purchase and sell the Notes in the open market. These transactions may include over-allotment,
stabilising transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids. Over-allotment involves sales
in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilising
transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or
maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in
the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids
permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker/dealer when the Notes
originally sold by such broker/dealer are purchased in a stabilising or covering transaction to cover short
positions. These transactions may be effected in the over the counter market or otherwise.

These activities may stabilise, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Notes. As a result,
the price of the Notes may be higher than the prices that otherwise might exist in the open market.
Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or
magnitude of any effect that the Offering described above may have on the price of the Notes. In
addition, there is no obligation on the Stabilisation Manager to engage in such transactions and neither
we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation that the Stabilisation Manager will engage in
these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.
Any stabilisation action may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms
of the offer of Notes is made and, if begun, may be ended at any time, but it must end no later than the
earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date of the Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the
Notes.


-----

**_Initial Settlement_**

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date
specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be U.S. business days (as
such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing
of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S.
Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days
unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to
trade the Notes any date prior to two business days before delivery will be required to specify an
alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the
Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.

**_Other Relationships_**

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial investment banking, financial advising,
investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial
Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates have performed commercial and investment banking and
advisory services for the Issuer, the Guarantors and their subsidiaries and affiliates from time to time
for which they have received customary fees and expenses. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates
may, from time to time, engage in transactions with, and perform services for, the Issuer, the Guarantors
and their subsidiaries and affiliates in the ordinary course of their business. The Initial Purchasers and
certain of their respective related entities may acquire, for their own accounts, a portion of the Notes.
Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may have positions, deal or make markets in the
Notes, related derivatives and reference obligations, including (but not limited to) entering into hedging
strategies on behalf of the Issuer and its affiliates, investor clients, or as principal in order to manage
their exposure, their general market risk, or other trading activities.

Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in
investment banking and/or commercial banking transactions with, and may perform services for, the
Issuer and their affiliates in the ordinary course of business. In addition, in the ordinary course of their
business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of
investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial
instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such
investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or its
affiliates. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with the
Issuer or its affiliates routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer or its affiliates consistent with
their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would
hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default
swaps or the creation of short positions in securities, including potentially the Notes. Any such positions
could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may
also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect
of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire,
long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates acted as mandated lead arrangers or lenders under our
Senior Facilities Agreement. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may also act
in one or more agency roles under these agreements. One or more of the Initial Purchasers may sell
through affiliates or other appropriately-licensed entities for sales for the Notes in jurisdictions where
they are otherwise not permitted.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE**

**VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY**

_Set out below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the security and guarantees_
_in certain of the jurisdictions in which security and/or Guarantees are being provided. It is a summary_
_only, and proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event could be initiated in any of these_
_jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of organisation of a future Guarantor. The application of these_
_various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply,_
_and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the_
_Notes and the Guarantees._

_Also set out below is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in England and Wales,_
_Denmark, Luxembourg, the European Union, Germany, Italy and the United States. In the event that_
_any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries experienced_
_financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions_
_insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings._

**England and Wales**

**_Certain Insolvency Considerations_**

Certain of the Guarantors and certain of the providers of Collateral are incorporated under the laws of
England and Wales (the “English Obligors”). Accordingly, any insolvency proceedings with respect to
the English Obligors would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency laws.

It is nonetheless possible that insolvency proceedings with respect to an English Obligor could be
opened in a different jurisdiction and be governed by the insolvency laws of that jurisdiction. In
particular, while the UK was a member state of the EU, insolvency processes opened in the UK were
subject to both EU and applicable UK domestic legislation. Following the UK’s departure from the EU
and the expiry of the subsequent transition period (the “Transition Period”) on December 31, 2020, in
accordance with the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended by the European Union
(Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020) EU law as directly applicable in the UK at the end of the Transition
Period (subject to certain exceptions) was transposed into UK domestic law subject to significant
amendments. Accordingly, the United Kingdom is no longer a European member state, including for
the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May
2015 on insolvency proceedings, recast, as amended (the “EU Insolvency Regulation and Regulation”),
Regulation (EU) 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on jurisdiction and the
recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (the “EU Judgments
_Regulation”), which have largely been repealed in the United Kingdom (pursuant to The Insolvency_
(Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) (as amended) (the “Insolvency Brexit
_Regulations”) and The Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019)._
The Insolvency Brexit Regulations also effected key amendments to domestic insolvency laws,
including the Insolvency Act 1986 (the “Insolvency Act”), the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules
2016 (SI 2016/1024) (the “Insolvency Rules”) and the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI
2006/1030) (the “Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations”). Accordingly, the United Kingdom is no
longer party to the European regime for reciprocal recognition of insolvency proceedings or
civil/commercial judgments under the EU Insolvency Regulation or the EU Judgments Regulation,
respectively. The prospects of a European member state opening insolvency proceedings in respect of
an English Obligor may vary between member states; the implications of any such proceedings,
including the prospect and implications of recognition in the United Kingdom, would need to be
carefully considered in each case.

For instance, unless insolvency proceedings or certain related proceedings were opened prior to the
expiry of the Transition Period, in which case the unmodified EU Insolvency Regulation and related
EU insolvency legislation govern the proceedings, insolvency proceedings with respect to the English


-----

Obligors would likely proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency laws in force at the time
of commencement of the relevant proceedings. However, to the extent that an English Obligor has its
COMI in a member state of the EU, insolvency proceedings could, pursuant to the EU Insolvency
Regulation and subject to certain exceptions, be opened in the relevant EU member state and be subject
to the laws of that EU member state (see “European Union” above). In addition, pursuant to the Cross
Border Insolvency Regulations, certain foreign courts may have jurisdiction to oversee insolvency
proceedings of any English Obligor which has its COMI or an “establishment” (being a place of
operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or
services) in such foreign jurisdiction.

Although the scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings
available in England and Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency
proceedings in respect of any company which has its COMI in the UK or which has its COMI in an EU
member state (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in the UK. An “establishment” is defined
in the same way as under the EU Insolvency Regulation (see “European Union” above). While this
allows English courts to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain
insolvency proceedings, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood
and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions (see “Cross_border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings” below)._

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which
investors may be familiar. In the event that the English Obligors experience financial difficulty, it is not
possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings.

English insolvency laws may not be as favourable to investors as United States or other insolvency
laws. English insolvency laws and other limitations on the Notes and the Guarantees may adversely
affect the validity and enforceability of the Notes and the Guarantees against an English Obligor and
may limit that amount that can be recovered under the Notes or the Guarantees.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to such certain
limitations. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their
rights under the Guarantees and/or under the Collateral and therefore may limit the amounts that
investors may receive in an insolvency of any of the English Obligors.

**_Administration_**

Under the Insolvency Act, as amended by the Insolvency Brexit Regulations, administration
proceedings are available in respect of any company incorporated in an EEA Member State, in addition
to a company registered under the Companies Act 2006 in England, Wales or Scotland and any company
(irrespective of its country of incorporation) with its COMI in an EU member state (other than
Denmark) or upon request from courts in other parts of the United Kingdom or certain other countries
and territories. In each case and subject to specific conditions, an administration order can be made if
the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts”
and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. A
company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as
they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less
than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), as per
Section 123 of the Insolvency Act. Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company
fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 21 days of service
or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order). Without limitation and subject to
specific conditions, a company, the directors of such company or the holder of a qualifying floating
charge (for further detail on what constitutes a qualifying floating charge, see “Qualifying Floating
_Charge” below) where the floating charge has become enforceable, may also appoint an administrator_
through an out of court process, subject to certain exceptions pursuant to the Insolvency Act. Note that
different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor.


-----

The purpose of an administration comprises three objectives, each of which must be considered
successively to determine whether it is reasonable to put the company into administration: rescuing the
company as a going-concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the
company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up (without first being
in administration) or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the
creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to
one or more secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to
creditors is set out below (see “Priority of Claims on Insolvency” below). An administrator must attempt
to achieve the objectives of administration in order, unless (s)he thinks it is not reasonably practicable
to achieve the primary objective, or that the secondary objective would achieve a better result for the
company’s creditors as a whole. The administrator cannot pursue the third objective unless (s)he thinks
either the first or the second objective is unachievable and that it will not unnecessarily harm the
interests of the creditors of the company as a whole to pursue the third objective.

Certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the
appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed and no step may be taken to enforce
security or a guarantee over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or the
permission of the court (although a demand for payment could be made under a guarantee granted by
the company). The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation
of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or
property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any
application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above.

Accordingly, if an English Obligor were to enter into administration, the Notes and the Guarantee, as
applicable, may not be enforceable while the relevant company was in administration without the
permission of the court or consent of the administrator. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent
would obtain such permission of the court or consent of the administrator.

In addition, an administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain
requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration
(including property subject to a floating charge). A set proportion of the proceeds of the realization of
any property subject to a floating charge will need to be set aside for satisfaction of the claims of
preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part (see “Prescribed Part” below). An
administrator may also, with prior approval by the court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge,
_provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration and the_
administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal towards discharging the obligations of the
company to the fixed charge holder.

However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be
able to realize their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory
moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial
_collateral agreement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or_
tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral
Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”).
Accordingly, if any of the English Obligors were to enter administration, it is possible that, to the extent
such security is a financial collateral arrangement, the security granted by it or the guarantee granted by
it would be enforceable while it is in administration without leave of the court or consent of the
administrators.

**_Qualifying Floating Charge_**

If a company grants security constituting a “qualifying floating charge” to a party for the purposes of
English insolvency law, that party will be able to appoint an administrator out of court (see
“Administration” above) or (in limited circumstances) an administrative receiver (see “Administrative
_Receivership” below). The holder of a qualifying floating charge is also entitled to advance notice of_


-----

an intention of a company or its directors to appoint an administrator, allowing the charge holder to
either appoint its own administrator (or, where applicable, administrative receiver) in place of the
proposed administrator, conduct negotiations with the proposed appointors over the identity or terms of
appointment of the proposed administrator or (in an extreme case) prevent the company going into
administration.

In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument
which: (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it (paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 of the
Insolvency Act); (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company; or
(c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by
Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. A party will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such
floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms of security granted to that party, relates
to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant company and at least one such
security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Please note that it is a matter of fact whether the extent
of the security granted relates to ‘the whole or substantially the whole’ of the property of a company
and there is no statutory guidance as to what percentage of a company’s assets should be charged to
satisfy this test.

**_Administrative Receivership_**

Administrative receivership as a creditor remedy has been largely abolished and is only available in
very limited circumstances. If a company grants a “qualifying floating charge” to a party for the
purposes of English insolvency law, that party will be able to appoint an administrator using the out of
court process. That party will also be able to appoint an administrative receiver if the qualifying floating
charge falls within one of the exceptions under the Insolvency Act (as amended by the Enterprise Act
2002) to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers, or if the security document
pre-dates 15 September 2003.

The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the
exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act), which may
apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50 million for the relevant company during the
life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which
is defined in the Insolvency Act, and generally includes rated, listed or traded debt instruments, and
debt instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded).

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court
(and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court
procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court
considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is invalid. If an
administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of part of
the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator.

**_Fixed charge receivership_**

A fixed charge receiver (as opposed to an administrative receiver, who is appointed under certain
floating charges - see “Administrative receivership” above) may be appointed over some or all of the
assets secured by a fixed charge in accordance with the terms of a security document creating a fixed
charge or (in limited circumstances) pursuant to statute under the Law of Property Act 1925, although
it is standard market practice to augment the powers of any receiver appointed through the relevant
security document.

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the
charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand
made for an appointment to take place. A receivership is not a process pursuant to English insolvency
laws as such and a fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator or an administrator.


-----

An administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver
was appointed under a charge which falls within the definition of a “security financial collateral
_arrangement,” as per Reg. 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations (see “Administration” above)._

The primary duty of the fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed,
meaning (s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor (although the receiver owes the chargor
a duty to act in good faith during the course of his or her appointment). This contrasts with the duty of
an administrator, who performs his or her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In
other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In
realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price
obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory
indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the company (and may
also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor).

To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be
deducted from the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any
preferential creditors (see “Prescribed Part” below).

**_Liquidation/Winding-up_**

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realized and
distributed by the liquidator to creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency
Act (see “Priority of Claims on Insolvency” below). There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory
liquidation, by order of the court and (b) members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary
liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members. The difference between the two latter
proceedings is the solvency of the company in question; in a members’ voluntary liquidation, the
directors of the company swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following
12 months whereas the primary ground for the creditors’ voluntary liquidation of an insolvent company
is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act – see
“Administration” above). Note that while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from
administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, but once in place the
process is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. Whereas compulsory liquidation and
creditors’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are available to foreign companies with sufficient nexus to
the UK in addition to companies within the English courts’ general jurisdiction, members’ voluntary
liquidation proceedings are only available to companies registered in England, Wales or Scotland.

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary
winding-up. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of
the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned
by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a
disposition or created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” under the
Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in
accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of
a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced from the time of the presentation of the
winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against
the company will be imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company
without permission of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose although there is no
freeze on the enforcement of security.

In the context of a voluntary winding-up however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a
winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the member’s resolution to wind up.
As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay
in the case of a voluntary winding-up - it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or shareholder of the
company, to apply for a stay to prevent the continuation of legal proceedings and enforcement of
security. This is important because it means secured creditors can go ahead and enforce their security.


-----

A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on
the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s
property and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions
(see “Avoidance of Transactions” below).

**_Scheme of Arrangement_**

Although not an insolvency proceeding, a scheme of arrangement is a statutory procedure pursuant to
Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006, which permits a company to enter into an arrangement or
compromise with its members or creditors (or any class of them). The English courts have jurisdiction
to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise of a company’s liabilities with respect
to its creditors (or any class of its creditors) where (a) such company is liable to be wound up under the
Insolvency Act and, in the context of a non-English company, (b) has a “sufficient connection” to the
English jurisdiction.

In practice, a non-English company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has
been found to be satisfied where, among other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the
company’s finance documents are English law-governed, or the company’s finance documents have
been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will
be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine
whether or not specific circumstances satisfy the requirement for sufficient connection in any given
case.

Before the court considers whether or not to sanction a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will
vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a
number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed
scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be
proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75 per cent. or more by
value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favor of
the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance
documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected
creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted
against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing at which
the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has
discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon
modifications being made to the scheme or decline to sanction the scheme. In exercising its discretion
to sanction a scheme of a non-English Obligor, the court will need to be satisfied that the scheme of
arrangement would have substantial effect in the jurisdictions in which the company has its main assets
or operations, in the jurisdictions of any other obligors of the debt and under the governing law of the
affected debt documents (if not English law). This is typically achieved by providing expert evidence
that the scheme of arrangement (or its effect) is likely to be recognized in such jurisdictions. Once
sanctioned, the scheme of arrangement binds all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in
the scheme of arrangement, which shall be effective (in accordance with its terms) upon delivery of the
court’s order sanctioning the scheme of arrangement to the Registrar of Companies.

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not
automatically trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings.

Schemes of arrangement have always been outside the scope of the EU Insolvency Regulation on the
basis that they are not considered to be ‘insolvency’ proceedings (although they are, in practice, often
used by financially distressed companies). Instead, if a scheme previously required recognition within
the EU, the EU Judgments Regulation was commonly relied upon as a basis on which recognition of
the judgment of the court sanctioning the scheme could be obtained in each member state.

**_Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020_**

The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (“CIGA”) was enacted on June 25, 2020. CIGA is
intended to improve the ability of companies to be efficiently restructured; it includes the following
provisions.

_Restructuring Plan Procedure_

CIGA introduced a new restructuring procedure, similar to a scheme of arrangement but with the added
possibility of cross-class cram-down to bind classes of dissenting stakeholders to the restructuring plan.

Like a scheme of arrangement, a restructuring plan is a procedure under the Companies Act 2006,
namely Part 26A of the Companies Act 2006 and is available to any company that is liable to be wound
up under the Insolvency Act.

A restructuring plan procedure may be proposed by the company or other stakeholders (including
creditors, shareholders, administrators or liquidators). As with a scheme of arrangement, affected
creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single
class or in a number of classes depending on the rights of such creditors which will be affected by the
proposed restructuring plan and any new rights that such creditors are given under the restructuring
plan.

The restructuring plan procedure is available as an option to both solvent and insolvent companies; the
company need only show that (a) it has encountered, or be likely to encounter, financial difficulties that
are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern, and (b) a
compromise or arrangement has been proposed between the company and its creditors (or any class of
them) whose purpose it is to eliminate, reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect of, any of those financial
difficulties.

A restructuring plan will be deemed to be approved if at least 75% in value of the creditors present and
voting at the meeting of at least one class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed compromise. There
is no requirement for the approving creditors to constitute a majority in number of those creditors
present and voting, and there is crucially no requirement for each and every voting class to approve the
plan, provided that:

(a) the court is satisfied that none of the members of the dissenting class(es) would be any worse off
under the plan than they would be in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’ (being whatever the court
considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not
sanctioned); and

(b) at least one class of creditors who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in
the company, in the event of the relevant alternative has voted in favor of the plan.

By virtue of these mechanics, the restructuring plan process provides for the possibility of a ‘cross-class
cram-down’, meaning the court may sanction a restructuring plan even if one or more classes of affected
creditors do not vote in favor of the restructuring plan, effectively allowing the vote of one class of
stakeholders to bind other classes. Following approval of the restructuring plan at the creditor
meeting(s), the restructuring plan needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the
court will review whether the applicable statutory conditions have been met and may also consider
whether the restructuring plan is just and equitable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction
the restructuring plan as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or refuse
to sanction the restructuring plan. Once sanctioned, the restructuring plan binds all affected stakeholders
whose rights will be as set out in the restructuring plan, which shall be effective (in accordance with its
terms) upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the restructuring plan to the Registrar of
Companies.


-----

As with schemes of arrangement, but unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a
restructuring plan does not automatically trigger a moratorium on claims or proceedings.

Stakeholders’ rights following confirmation of a restructuring plan will be as provided for in the plan.
If a company were subsequently to enter an insolvency procedure following a restructuring plan, the
rights and claims of any stakeholders bound by the plan would be as set out in the plan. Any debt
forgiveness would therefore be binding in the subsequent insolvency proceedings.

**_Priority of Claims on Insolvency_**

One of the primary functions of liquidation (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a
going-concern, one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets
of the insolvent company and to distribute the cash realizations made from those assets to its creditors.
Under the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules, creditors are placed into different classes, with
proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of
priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions
generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class
have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made
on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor
within a class.

Contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or administration
are only respected to the extent they fall within the definition of “mutual dealing” as applied by the
mandatory insolvency set-off regime. This regime sees an account being taken of what is due from each
party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and only the resulting net balance is either provable
by the creditor in the administration or liquidation of the company (if amounts remain due to the
creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if amounts remain due to the
company).

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

- _First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent the value of the secured assets_
cover that indebtedness);

- _Second ranking:_ expenses of the insolvent estate incurred during the relevant insolvency
proceedings (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses
are-paid);

- _Third ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors._

Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in
relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of
employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per
person; and (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the
termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency.

Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of ordinary preferential debts and
include claims by HM Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) in respect of certain taxes including VAT,
PAYE income tax (including student loan repayments), employee NI contributions and Construction
Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are
held by the company on behalf of employees and customers. As between one another, secondary
preferential debts rank equally after the ordinary preferential debts;

- _Fourth ranking:_ holders of floating charge security, to the extent of the realizations from those
secured assets, according to the priority of their security. This would include any security interest


-----

that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on a proper
interpretation by the court, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset
realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must, subject
to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors;

- _Fifth ranking: firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and any secured creditor to the extent_
of any remaining debt due to it (a shortfall), in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on
those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the
secured creditors any shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured
assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the
Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors or the secured creditor elects to
surrender its security;

- secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the
official rate in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in respect of
any period after the commencement of liquidation, or after the commencement of any
administration which had been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case
of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the Guarantees, such interest due to the
holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged
out of such security recoveries; and

- thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above
and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully repaid.
This however does not include “currency conversion” claims following the English Supreme Court
Lehman Brothers ruling dated May 17, 2017; and

- _Sixth ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining_
funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the
subordination language in the relevant documentation.

**_Prescribed Part_**

An insolvency officeholder of the company (e.g., administrator, administrative receiver or liquidator)
will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating
charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential
creditors and expenses out of floating charge realizations) (the “Prescribed Part”). Under current law,
this ring-fence applies to 50 per cent. of the first £10,000 of floating charge realizations and 20 per cent.
of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the
company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first ranking floating charge
created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed
Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate
to the resulting benefit to creditors. The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of
secured creditors. Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and other security will
constitute substantially the whole of the relevant English Obligors’ assets at the time that the floating
charges are enforced will be a question of fact at the time.

The requirement of the insolvency officeholder to set aside a Prescribed Part will not apply to any
charge created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial
Collateral Regulations.


-----

**_Challenges to Guarantees and Security_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of
security and/or guarantees, or the entry by an English company into a transaction can be challenged. In
most cases, this will only arise if the company is placed into administration or liquidation within a
specified period after the granting of the security and/or guarantee. Therefore, if during the specified
period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, the administrator or liquidator
may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given by such company, or certain transactions
entered into by the company. The Issuer cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an English
Obligor’s insolvency (as described below) is within any of the requisite time periods, the grant of a
security interest and/or guarantee in respect of the Notes would not be challenged or that a court would
uphold the transaction as valid.

**_Onset of Insolvency_**

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and
invalid floating charges (as discussed below), depends on the insolvency procedure in question.

In an administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an
administration order is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or
(c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect.

In a compulsory liquidation the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to
court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes a winding-up resolution.
Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be the same as for the initial
administration.

**_Connected Persons_**

If the given transaction at an undervalue, preference, or invalid floating charge has been entered into by
the company with a “connected person,” then particular specified time periods and presumptions will
apply to any challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set out below).

A “connected person” of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of
transactions at an undervalue, preferences or invalid floating charges is a party who is: (a) a director of
the company; (b) a shadow director; (c) an associate of such director or shadow director; or (d) an
associate of the relevant company.

A party is associated with an individual if they are: (a) a relative of the individual; (b) the individual’s
husband, wife or civil partner; (c) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (d) the
husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual; or (e) the husband, wife or civil partner of
a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner.

A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company.

A company is associated with another company if (a) the same person has control of both companies,
(b) a person has control of one and persons who are his or her associates, or (s)he and persons who are
his or her associates, have control of the other or (c) if a group of two or more persons has control of
each company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of
the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person
of whom (s)he is an associate.

A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another
company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his or her
directions or instructions, or (s)he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of
the voting power at any general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of


-----

it. Where two or more persons together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having
control of the company.

The potential grounds for challenge available under the English insolvency legislation that may apply
to any security interest or guarantee granted by an English Obligor include, without limitation, the
following described below.

**_Transactions at an Undervalue_**

Under Section 238 of the Insolvency Act, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an
order to set aside a transaction, for example the creation of a security interest or a guarantee, (or give
such other relief as the court thinks fit for restoring the position to what it otherwise would have been)
where the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. It
will only be a transaction at an undervalue if at the time of the transaction, or as a consequence of the
transaction, the company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts as a result (as
defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the company enters
into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two years ending with the onset of
insolvency from the date of the transaction. A transaction may be set aside as a transaction at an
undervalue if the company made a gift to a person, if the company received no consideration or if the
company received consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the
consideration given by such company.

However, a court shall not make an order if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction
in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were
reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the company. If the court determines
that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court shall make such order as it thinks fit to
restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction, which
may include reducing payments due under or setting aside security interests or guarantees. In any
proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was unable to pay
its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case there is a
presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate the solvency of the company in
such proceedings. See “Connected Persons” above.

An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose any
obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the
transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a
person other than the company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such
an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and
for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the person was
a party to the transaction.

**_Preference_**

Under Section 239 of the Insolvency Act, a liquidator or administrator of a company could apply to the
court for an order to set aside a transaction, for example the creation of a security interest or a guarantee
(or give such other relief as the court thinks fit for restoring the position to what it otherwise would
have been) where the creation of such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. It
will only be a preference if the company is unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction or
becomes unable to pay its debts as a result (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The
transaction can be challenged if the company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings
within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected
person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person, except where such beneficiary is a
connected person by reason only of being the company’s employee) from the date the company gives
the preference ending with the onset of insolvency. A transaction may constitute a preference if it has
the effect of putting a creditor of the company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts


-----

or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than
such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered
into. However, for the court to determine a preference, it must be shown that the company was
influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. If the court determines that the transaction was
a preference, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the company to the position it
would have been in had it not entered into the transaction.

In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was unable
to pay its debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor, unless
the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a connected
person by reason only of being the company’s employee), in which case it is presumed that the company
intended to put that person in a better position and the connected person must demonstrate that there
was, in fact, no such influence. An order by the court for a preference may affect the property of, or
impose any obligation on, any person whether or not (s)he is the person to whom the preference was
given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person
other than the company in good faith, for value without notice of the relevant circumstances, or
prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a
benefit from the preference in good faith, for value without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay
a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect
of a preference given to that person at a time when (s)he was a creditor of the company.

**_Transactions Defrauding Creditors_**

Under Section 423 of the Insolvency Act, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue,
and the court is satisfied that it was made for the substantial purpose of putting assets beyond the reach
of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against the company in question, or of otherwise
prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make,
and one or more of the criteria set out in the applicable provisions of the Insolvency Act is satisfied the
transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. This provision may be
used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction (and is not therefore limited to
liquidators or administrators) and, subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial Conduct Authority,
the UK Prudential Regulation Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator (with the leave of the court if
the company is in liquidation or administration). There is no statutory time limit under English
insolvency legislation within which the challenge must be made (subject to the normal statutory
limitation periods) and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of, or as a result
of, the transaction.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make
such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not
been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction, which may include
reducing payments due under the relevant notes or setting aside security interests or guarantees. The
relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not
(s)he is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not
prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a third-party in good faith, for value and
without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not require a person who received a benefit from
such transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay any
sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company unless such person was a party to the transaction.

**_Extortionate Credit Transactions_**

An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. A
credit transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the
credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether
unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise
grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing. It is presumed, unless otherwise proved by the


-----

person extending the credit, that a transaction with respect to which an administrator or liquidator makes
an application to set aside an extortionate credit transaction is extortionate. The court can make an order
in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by a company up to three years before the day
on which a company entered administration or liquidation. That order may set aside, either in whole or
in part, any obligation created by the transaction (which could include obligations of sureties). It may
also vary the terms of the transaction or the terms of any security for the purposes of the transaction.
The court may require any party to the transaction to repay to the liquidator or administrator sums
already paid under the transaction and it may order the surrender of any security held for the purpose
of the transaction. It should be noted that there are no provisions for the protection of third parties who
acquire interests in the extortionate credit transaction (e.g. assignees of the benefit of the transaction
from the person who provided credit under it).

**_Avoidance of Floating Charges_**

Under Section 245 of the Insolvency Act, floating charges created by a company within a period of one
year prior to the onset of the company’s insolvency (or two years in the case of a floating charge created
in favor of a connected person) at a time when the company was unable to pay its debts or became
unable to do so as a consequence of the transaction, will be invalid, except to the extent of the value of:
(a) the money paid to; (b) the goods or services supplied to; or (c) any discharge or reduction of any
debt of, the relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain
interest) (the “Consideration”). The floating charge will not be invalid if, at the time it was created, the
company was solvent and did not become insolvent as a result; however, this exception will not apply
if the person in favor of whom it was created is connected.

An administrator or liquidator (as applicable) does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that
a floating charge is invalid by operation of law. Any floating charge created during the relevant time
period is automatically invalid, except to the extent of the value of the Consideration. A liquidator or
administrator can inform the relevant floating charge holder that it considers the charge to be invalid
(or only partly valid as regards new consideration). This may prompt the floating charge holder to seek
to enforce the charge (which would then likely trigger an application from the office holder for a court
declaration that the charge is invalid) or seek a court declaration as to its validity.

If the floating charge constitutes a “security financial collateral agreement” under the Financial
Collateral Regulations then the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in
“Administration” above.

**_Fixed Versus Floating Charges_**

The Guarantees benefit from fixed and floating charge security over certain Collateral owned by the
English Obligors. Until floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets
that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets
can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third-party good title to the assets
free of the floating charge.

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge
security, namely: (a) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority
as against a floating charge over the same charged assets (provided that the floating charge has not
crystallized at the time the fixed charge was granted and there were no restrictions on the creation of
such security which the fixed charge holder was aware of); (b) general costs and expenses (including
the remuneration of the insolvency office-holders and the costs of continuing to operate the business of
the charging company while in administration) properly incurred in a winding-up or administration are
generally payable out of the assets of the charging company (including the assets (including cash) that
are the subject of the floating charge) and insolvency office-holders appointed to a charging company
can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash to meet such general costs and expenses in
priority to the claims of the floating charge holder to the extent that the value of the charging company’s


-----

unsecured assets is not sufficient to cover such costs and expenses in full (the same does not apply to
fixed charge assets); (c) as mentioned above, until the floating charge security crystallizes, a company
is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of
business; (d) there are particular insolvency “clawback” risks in relation to floating charge security;
(e) floating charge security is subject to the claims of certain preferential creditors (such as employee
salary claims (up to a cap per employee), employee holiday claims and certain unpaid pension
contributions) where the floating charge is not a security financial collateral arrangement and subject to
the ring fencing of the Prescribed Part for unsecured creditors; and (f) an administrator may dispose of
or take action relating to property subject to a floating charge without the prior consent of the charge
holder or court but the floating charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from
the disposal of the assets subject to the floating charge. Only with prior approval of the court can an
administrator deal with property subject to a fixed charge _provided that disposing of the property is_
likely to promote the administration’s purpose and that the administrator apply the gross proceeds from
the disposal of the property in question towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge
holder.

There is a possibility under English law that a court could find that some or all of the fixed security
interests expressed to be created by the security documents governed by English law properly take effect
as floating charges as the description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the
purported fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than recharacterized
as floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the
requisite degree of control over the chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds
thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the security holder in practice. Where the chargor
is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion and without
the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question
constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.

If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests: (a) the proceeds of those
assets could be applied in meeting other liabilities of the company in priority to the claims of the
purported fixed charge holder in insolvency proceedings and (b) it is possible that any purported floating
charge security may no longer relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the
relevant company and therefore may not constitute a “qualifying floating charge.” See also
“Administrative Receivership.”

**_Disclaimer_**

An English liquidator has the power to disclaim onerous property, which is any unprofitable contract
or other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay
money or perform any other onerous act, by serving the prescribed notice on the relevant party. A
contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial
obligations on a company that may be detrimental to creditors. A contract will not be unprofitable
merely because it is financially disadvantageous or because the company could have made, or could
make, a better bargain. However, this power to disclaim onerous property does not apply to an executed
contract nor can it, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company from any
liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person. Any person suffering loss or damage in
consequence of the operation of the disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company and may prove
for the loss or damage in the winding-up. The critical feature is that the performance of future
obligations would prejudice the liquidator’s obligation to realize the assets and make a distribution to
creditors.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

The grant of a Guarantee or Collateral by the English Obligors in respect of the obligations of another
group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be
allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that these


-----

documents do not allow such an action, there is a risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent
security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may
be obtained for third-parties if they are dealing with the English Obligors in good faith; however, the
relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be
established for each English Obligor in question with respect to its entry into entering the proposed
transaction must be of corporate benefit for the English Obligors. Section 172 of the Companies Act
2006 provides that a director must act in the way that (s)he considers, in good faith, would be most
likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors
enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to have
abused their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court.
Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the
directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory
provisions do not prescribe when directors’ duties to creditors arise, the English courts have held that
the shift takes place when the directors know, or should know, that the company in question is or is
likely to become insolvent, with “likely” in this context meaning “probable.”

Under the Companies Act 2006, subject to limited exceptions, any security (including security not
governed by English law) granted by a company incorporated in England and Wales (together with
prescribed particulars of the security constituted thereby) must be received by the Registrar of
Companies for registration within 21-days after the date of creation of the security constituted by the
applicable security document. Such security, if not registered within the 21-day period, will be deemed
to be void against a liquidator, administrator or a creditor of the company. When security becomes so
void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become immediately
payable.

In the event that the relevant security document is not registered, the company may be required to enter
into a new security document and register it with Companies House within 21 days of its creation.

In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order allowing the
charge to be registered after the 21-day period has expired. An application for such an order can be
made by the company or by any person interested in the relevant security. The court will grant leave to
register the security out of time if it considers it “just and expedient” to do so, and will have particular
regard to whether the failure to register was merely accidental and whether a late registration will
prejudice the position of creditors or shareholders. The court order will have to be enclosed with any
delayed application for registration of the security.

The Financial Collateral Regulations exempt certain charges over financial collateral from registration
with the Registrar of Companies. Security granted by non-English companies over assets in England
and Wales does not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies (although they may still need
to be registered with the applicable asset registry).

Guarantees and security granted by a company are also subject to limitations to the extent they would
result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of the Companies Act 2006.

**_Moratoriums_**

As outlined above, certain of the insolvency processes available in England and Wales provide for the
automatic or optional moratorium imposing a period of time during which third parties including
creditors are unable to institute or continue legal action against the company, enforce certain rights
and/or call upon security or guarantees. Besides the moratorium available to companies undergoing
administration (see “Administration” above), moratoriums are also available to companies entering
liquidation (see “Liquidation/winding-up” above).


-----

**_Foreign Currency_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their
debts, the office-holder must convert all foreign currency denominated proofs of debt into sterling at a
single rate for each currency determined by the office-holder by reference to the exchange rates
prevailing at the date when the company went into liquidation or administration. This provision
overrides any agreement between the parties. If a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, they
may apply to the court; if, on hearing the application, the court finds that the rate is unreasonable, it
may itself determine the rate.

Accordingly, in the event that an English Obligor enters liquidation or administration, holders of the
relevant notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date on which the English Obligor
enters into liquidation or administration and receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the relevant
notes may become entitled. Any losses resulting from currency fluctuations are not recoverable from
the insolvent estate.

**_Reliance on Ipso Facto Clauses Restricted_**

CIGA inserted a new permanent measure for the protection of supplies of goods and services into the
Insolvency Act. The measure provides that a provision of a contract for the supply of goods or services
which permits the supplier to terminate the contract or the supply, or do any other thing (e.g. impose
amended terms), on the grounds that the counterparty becomes subject to a relevant insolvency
procedure, will be void. A relevant insolvency procedure for this purpose includes winding-up
proceedings, administration, the standalone moratorium and the new restructuring plan procedure, but
not a scheme of arrangement.

Other rights to terminate under the contract (i.e. other than as a result of the counterparty being subject
to a relevant insolvency procedure) are preserved, to the extent the termination event arises after
commencement of the insolvency proceeding. A supplier may be allowed to terminate the contract if
the company or the relevant insolvency practitioner consents or if permission is granted by the court on
it being satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship.

Certain exclusions apply, including for contracts involving financial services (which includes contracts
for the provision of financial services consisting of lending and contracts for the purchase or sale of a
security).

**_Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings_**

_General position_

The recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings in other jurisdictions is governed
by applicable treaties in respect of the mutual recognition (or otherwise) of courts’ jurisdiction,
proceedings and judgments and general principles of private international law such as comity and
conflicts of laws rules applicable in the relevant jurisdictions.

One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency
(the “Model Law”), which has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States
and Great Britain, where it was implemented by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations. The Model
Law provides for recognition of certain British insolvency proceedings in other signatory states as either
foreign main proceedings (if the COMI of the relevant debtor is determined to be in Great Britain) or
foreign non-main proceedings (if the COMI is determined to be in another jurisdiction but the debtor
has an establishment in Great Britain) upon application by the relevant insolvency officeholder. The
nature and scope of the recognition will depend on the way that the Model Law has been implemented
into the domestic law of the jurisdiction in question. Conversely, the Cross-Border Insolvency
Regulations provide for recognition in the UK of foreign insolvency proceedings as either main
proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in the jurisdiction where the debtor has its COMI) or


-----

non-main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in a jurisdiction in which the debtor has only
an establishment).

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement, which
are restructuring rather than insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters
relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as
the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 (the “Hague Convention”) and the Lugano
Convention 2007 (the “Lugano Convention”) (subject to the UK’s pending application to accede to the
latter) where these apply. In addition, recognition may still be available under principles of private
international law and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (“Rome I”).

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans is a
developing area of law. It remains to be seen whether restructuring plans will fall within the scope of
treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement
of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention and the Lugano Convention, or whether they will be
treated more akin to insolvency and restructuring proceedings and fall within related exceptions to such
treaties.

_Recognition in the EU_

Following the UK’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the Transition Period, UK proceedings no
longer benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in EU member states. As the trade and
cooperation terms agreed between the EU and the UK do not include a replacement regime for the
current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the EU (and vice versa) or otherwise
address insolvency matters, cross-border insolvencies involving the UK and one or more EU member
states will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased complexity.

Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more
problematic for UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU member states
and for UK office holders to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. The general
position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend on the private international law rules
adopted in the relevant EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings,
increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK
office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less
certain that such appointment will be recognized in other EU member states. To the extent relevant
proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of contract law, Rome I may offer an alternative basis
for recognition in EU member states.

As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the EU
member states may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the UK
was a member state of the EU. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent
proceedings will be recognized and whether investors may be adversely affected as a result. For
instance, although some member states have their own laws, or bilateral treaties with the UK, that might
enable recognition of an English scheme, the number of these states is limited and the application of
these laws and treaties to schemes is untested.

**Denmark**

The below considerations in respect of Danish law only apply to Danish public limited liability
companies (aktieselskab or A/S) and private public limited liability companies (anpartsselskab or ApS)
such as the Danish Guarantor (unless otherwise stated).

One of the Guarantors is a company incorporated under the laws of Denmark. Any insolvency
proceedings with respect to the Danish Guarantor would be based on Danish insolvency laws. Please


-----

note that the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply to Denmark. It should be noted that the Directive
(EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on preventive
restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the
efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt (the “Restructuring
_Directive”), applies in Denmark and was implemented into Danish national law and became effective_
as of 17 July 2022. The changes to the Danish Insolvency Act (konkursloven) following from the
implementation of the Restructuring Directive include, inter alia, a new ability for a debtor to petition
a so-called pre-emptive in-court restructuring (forebyggende rekonstruktionsbehandling) prior to such
debtor becoming insolvent.

Danish insolvency laws may not be as favourable to investors’ interests as the laws of the United States
or other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar. In the event that the Danish Guarantor
experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or
similar proceedings. There are two kinds of Danish in-court insolvency proceedings; bankruptcy and
in-court restructuring (including pre-emptive restructurings).

**_Bankruptcy Proceedings_**

Bankruptcy proceedings may be commenced either at the petition of a debtor or a creditor, however
_provided that the debtor is insolvent, which pursuant to the Danish Insolvency Act is defined as the_
debtor’s inability to pay his debts as they fall due, unless such inability is considered to be temporary.

The petition for bankruptcy must be filed with the bankruptcy court in the district in which the debtor
operates his business. The bankruptcy court does not publish information on the receipt of the petition
for bankruptcy, but any person having a legal interest is entitled to receive information as to whether
and when a debtor has filed a petition for bankruptcy (debtor’s own petition). The bankruptcy court
does not provide information on a creditor’s petition for bankruptcy.

A creditor cannot demand that the debtor be declared bankrupt if the creditor’s claim is secured by
adequate security. In this context, adequate security means a security right expected to provide full
coverage for the creditor. If the security is voidable in bankruptcy or the act of perfection has not been
performed, the creditor does not have adequate security.

The creditor is not required to have a basis of execution for his claim, e.g., a judgment in a civil case, a
settlement in-court or a signed debt instrument or mortgage. Further, the creditor’s claim does not have
to be due for payment to form basis of a petition for bankruptcy. However, the creditor must have a
legal interest in the debtor’s estate being administered in bankruptcy. As a result, not all claims that
have not become due for payment may form basis of a petition for bankruptcy. Depending on the
circumstances, an overdraft facility still being in force or a repayment arrangement being observed by
the debtor may result in the creditor’s petition being rejected. The requirement for legal interest also
means that in general the bankruptcy court will reject a creditor’s petition for bankruptcy if it is clear in
advance that he will not receive any dividend in case of bankruptcy. It should be noted, however, that
if there is probable cause to believe that the debtor has made avoidable transactions, the creditor may
have the required legal interest in the bankruptcy even if the debtor does not have substantial assets. In
that case, the creditor must be able to substantiate the avoidable transactions with some degree of
certainty.

A creditor having filed a petition for bankruptcy against a debtor will be liable to pay damages if the
debtor suffers a loss or to pay compensation for injury to the debtor’s reputation if the bankruptcy
conditions, the insolvency requirement, are not fulfilled or if the claim does not exist.

The petitioner must provide security for the expenses relating to the administration of the estate. In
practice, the bankruptcy court demands security in the amount of DKK 30,000 (DKK 40,000 if subject
to the jurisdiction of the Commercial and Maritime Court). If the debtor has filed the petition for
bankruptcy, the security must be provided by the funds of the bankruptcy estate.


-----

**_Bankruptcy Trustee_**

One or more trustees are appointed at the discretion of the bankruptcy court; however, in practice the
request of the major unsecured and unsubordinated creditors have the decisive influence as another
trustee can be appointed at a creditor’s meeting.

The trustee is not required to be a qualified attorney-at-law, but in practice that is generally always the
case.

The trustee must comply with the disqualification rules of the Danish Insolvency Act. Consequently,
the trustee must not be the debtor’s related party or depending on the debtor, and there must not be any
doubt as to whether the trustee is impartial. As a general rule, the debtor’s own attorney is prevented
from being appointed as trustee due to the disqualification rules. The bankruptcy court may also find
that a person being a member of the board of directors of the debtor’s business or a person being the
debtor’s advisor cannot be appointed as trustee. Likewise, any person whom the bankruptcy estate is
expected to make claims against, e.g., an avoidance claim or otherwise, will most likely be deemed to
have a personal interest in the administration of the estate and would therefore not meet these
requirements.

The trustee will make all decisions concerning the administration of the bankruptcy estate, and he
represents the estate in every respect. The bankruptcy court supervises the trustee but is not involved in
the actual administration of the estate.

**_In-Court Restructuring_**

In-court restructuring proceedings may be commenced either at the petition of the debtor or a creditor.
The petition for in-court restructuring must be filed with the bankruptcy court in the district in which
the debtor operates his business.

In-court restructuring proceedings may only be commenced if the debtor is insolvent (same as described
above with respect to bankruptcy). If this criterion is fulfilled, the bankruptcy court will immediately
appoint a restructuring administrator and a restructuring accountant to oversee the restructuring of the
company. The management continues to operate the company, but any material transactions may not
be carried out without the prior approval of the restructuring administrator. Payment of creditors may
only be done in accordance with the priority of claims as described below.

The in-court restructuring of a company must achieve one or more of the following statutory objectives:
(1) the in-court restructuring of the business by means of a compulsory composition; (2) the termination
of the business of the company by transferring the business; (3) any other initiative(s) taken for the
purpose of ending the debtor’s insolvency (such as conversion of debt or supply of additional equity)
or (4) any combination of (1), (2) and (3). The aim of a restructuring is therefore to salvage the business
itself, but not necessarily thereby saving the company.

The restructuring administrator will propose a restructuring plan, and creditors with a legal interest who
attend the voting meeting at the court can vote for or against the proposed restructuring plan.

If the in-court restructuring does not contain at least one of these required elements, the in-court
restructuring will automatically seize and, provided the company is still insolvent, bankruptcy
proceedings shall be initiated.

It is possible to withdraw unsuccessful restructuring proceedings without bankruptcy proceedings being
commenced, provided that the withdrawal shall occur prior to the date of the meeting, during which the
restructuring proposal is to be presented (i.e., within four weeks of the commencement of the
restructuring proceedings). Following the withdrawal of unsuccessful restructuring proceedings, it will
not be possible to file for new restructuring proceedings until one month after the withdrawal.


-----

Furthermore, it is possible to complete an in-court restructuring by way of a so-called “fast track
_procedure”. This process entails that a business transfer may take place without the adoption of a_
restructuring plan if deemed expedient for preserving the value of the company. The restructuring
administrator is required to consent to the transfer. The creditors are granted five days to object to the
transfer and, if a majority of the creditors entitled to vote does not vote against the transfer, it may be
executed.

**_In-court Pre-emptive Restructuring_**

Following the implementation into Danish law of the Restructuring Directive, the Danish Insolvency
Act now also allows for in-court pre-emptive restructuring proceedings, which can commence prior to
a debtor becoming insolvent.

In-court pre-emptive restructuring proceedings may only be commenced by the debtor himself (as
opposed to the general in-court restructuring proceedings) and does not require that the debtor is
insolvent at the time of the petition. Instead, the criterion for the petitioning of a pre-emptive
restructuring is that the debtor in its own judgment is likely to become insolvent due to existing financial
difficulties of the debtor.

Any petition for an in-court pre-emptive restructuring does not take precedent over a creditor's
petitioning of an in-court restructuring or bankruptcy proceedings (save that such proceedings can only
successfully be petitioned if the debtor is in fact insolvent). However, the court may on a case-by-case
basis decide to postpone such creditor's petition for an in-court restructuring or bankruptcy proceedings.

The petition for in-court pre-emptive restructuring must be filed with the bankruptcy court in the district
in which the debtor operates his business. Equivalent to the rules governing the general in-court
restructurings, the management of the debtor continues to operate the company. As opposed to the
general in-court restructuring regime, a pre-emptive restructuring does not result in an automatic
prohibition against the taking of enforcement action against the debtor or its assets. Instead, such
prohibition will only be effective if the debtor requests the court to grant such prohibition and is
conditional upon the appointment of a restructuring administrator similar to the process for general incourt restructuring process. If a restructuring administrator is appointed, any material transactions may
not be carried out without the prior approval of the restructuring administrator

In addition, the prohibition against taking enforcement action against the debtor does not affect any
existing and duly registered floating charges (virksomhedspant) and such floating charges do not
crystalise upon the commencement of a pre-emptive restructuring and the debtor is therefore able to
dispose of the assets subject to the floating charge in the ordinary course of business (udskillelse ifølge
_regelmæssig drift)._

The in-court pre-emptive restructuring of a company must achieve one or more of the same statutory
objectives as required for the general in-court restructurings.

It is possible to withdraw unsuccessful restructuring proceedings without bankruptcy proceedings being
commenced, provided that withdrawal shall occur prior to the date of the meeting, during which the
restructuring proposal is to be presented (i.e. within four weeks of the commencement of the
restructuring proceedings). Following the withdrawal of unsuccessful restructuring proceedings, it will
not be possible to file for a new restructuring until one month after the withdrawal.

It is possible to complete an in-court restructuring by way of a so-called “fast track procedure.” This
process entails that a business transfer may take place without the adoption of a restructuring plan if
deemed expedient for preserving the value of the company. The restructuring administrator is required
to consent to the transfer. The creditors are granted five days to object to the transfer and, if a majority
of the creditors entitled to vote does not vote against the transfer, it may be executed.


-----

**_Liquidation_**

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of the company are realised and
distributed by the liquidator to the creditors and, providing all creditors have been paid in full, the
shareholders. In Denmark, liquidation is not an insolvency proceeding, and only companies that are
solvent can be liquidated. If a company is insolvent, or if it turns out during the liquidation process that
the company cannot pay all its creditors in full, the company must enter bankruptcy proceedings instead.
The decision to liquidate a company is made by the shareholders of the company at a general meeting
who also appoint a liquidator. At the end of the liquidation process the company will be dissolved.

**_Certain Avoidance Rules and Hardening Periods_**

Under the Danish Insolvency Act, the bankruptcy estate is entitled to under certain circumstances to
avoid the debtor’s transactions in a reference period preceding the bankruptcy if such transactions have
reduced the assets of the estate or otherwise damaged the estate, or if the transactions have favoured
certain creditors without observing the ranking of the creditors.

Transactions damaging the estate are for example gifts (including sale of assets at undervalue),
renunciations of inheritance or the payment of excessive salary or pension to related parties.
Transactions favouring creditors without observing the ranking of creditors are for example payment
by unusual means of payment, payments before due date, payments having significantly impaired the
debtor’s ability to pay or the provision of security for prior debts. Special attention is given to the
avoidance rule on security for prior debts and the general avoidance rule in the following paragraphs.

Any security interest created and perfected within a three-month reference period prior to the
bankruptcy and which has not been created prior to, or simultaneously with, the debt obligations which
it secures, or which is not perfected without undue delay after the creation of such debt obligations may
be subject to an avoidance claim from the estate.

Danish insolvency law operates with a general avoidance rule, which stipulates that an action which
unduly benefits a single creditor to the detriment of the other creditors, or whereby the company’s assets
are prevented from serving the purpose of satisfying the creditors, or whereby the company’s debt is
increased to the detriment of the creditors, may be declared void if the company was or because of the
action became insolvent, and the benefitted party knew or ought to have known about the company’s
insolvency and the circumstances that made the action improper. Generally, only transactions which
are contrary to common norms of correct and decent business behaviour will be deemed improper.
Improper behaviour is normally related to a breach of the purpose of insolvency proceedings, which
typically is the situation where a creditor should have realised that a given transaction would deprive
the other creditors of their right to fulfilment of their claims.

The usual reference period is three months prior to the filing date, which is extended to up to 24 months
for transactions with parties closely related to the company, and the general avoidance rule (as described
above) provides for a theoretically unlimited avoidance period with respect to improper transactions.
The requirement that the company must have been in an uninterrupted insolvent state throughout the
entire period does, however, limit the practical length of the reference period.

**_Legal Position of Unsecured Claims and Priority of Claims_**

Creditors believing to have a claim against the debtor or the bankruptcy estate must prove their claims
and accompany their proofs of claim by adequate documentation. The trustee registers all claims and
examines whether they are legitimate and entitle the creditor to receive dividend.

The ranking of creditors is described in the Danish Insolvency Act which determines the order in which
claims against the estate or the debtor are settled. All higher-ranking claims must be satisfied in full
before the next level will be entitled to dividend, i.e., a water fall scheme. The ranking of creditors is as
follows:


-----

- Firstly: costs or claims incurred in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings or claims
according to agreements upheld by the estate;

- Secondly: reasonable claims in connection with any prior attempted restructuring proceedings;

- Thirdly: claims for wages or salaries payable;

- Fourthly: claims of suppliers for certain indirect taxes;

- Fifthly: unsecured claims (all other claims except for deferred claims); and

- Sixthly: deferred claims (interest, fines, promises of gifts and subordinate loan capital).

Secured claims are handled separately from the water fall and the secured claim is paid using the
proceeds from the collateral that secures the claim. If the secured claim is not covered by the proceeds,
the outstanding part of the secured claim will generally be considered as a regular unsecured claim in
the waterfall. The handling of secured claims will in each case depend on the type of security.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

The Danish Companies Act (selskabsloven) contains restrictions on financial assistance by Danish
limited liability companies. Danish companies and their foreign subsidiaries can, directly or indirectly,
advance funds, grant loans or provide guarantee and/or security in respect of obligations of amongst
others, their direct and indirect parent companies. If the relevant shareholder is not a limited liability
company incorporated in a jurisdiction which is a member of the EU or European Economic Area or
Switzerland, Australia, Canada, Chile, Great Britain, Japan, Northern Ireland, Israel, South Korea, New
Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan or U.S., then the following special requirements apply to such financial
assistance: (i) the financial assistance is within the distributable reserves and made on ordinary market
terms (on an arm’s-length basis), (ii) the financial assistance must be approved by the shareholders/at a
shareholders meeting and cannot exceed such approved amount and (iii) the financial assistance can
only be made after the first annual account.

As a general rule, Danish companies and their foreign subsidiaries are prohibited from granting loans
and or guarantees or security in connection with the financing or refinancing of the direct or indirect
acquisition of their own shares or shares in their direct or indirect parent companies and any such loan,
guarantee or security will be invalid and unenforceable. Such financial assistance is only permitted in
accordance with certain preconditions and requirements, which include obtaining a credit rating on the
recipient of the financial assistance, a report (to be publicised) by the central management body
(including providing the reason behind the financial assistance, company’s interest, conditions of the
transaction, assessment of consequences and price for the shares to be paid by the buyer), a resolution
by the general meeting approving the financial assistance. The financial assistance must be within the
distributable reserves and made on ordinary market terms (on an arm’s-length basis).

**_Corporate Benefit_**

It is a requirement under Danish law that a guarantor or security provider obtains an adequate corporate
benefit from the issuance of a guarantee or the granting of security. This is due to a requirement under
Danish law that the management of a company must always ensure a proper management of the
company’s assets.

Further, the management board and the board of directors of the company is obliged to act in accordance
with the company’s individual interests, including consideration of the company’s financial position,
the benefits the company will obtain through and the risks related to the granting of security, assessment
of the debtor, securing that the arrangement is on market terms, etc. If such benefit is not obtained,
among others, the guarantee or security interest may be null and void. It is not clear under Danish case


-----

law to what extent such corporate benefit is established when a subsidiary guarantees and/or secures
debt of a direct or indirect parent company.

**_Contractual Limitations of Guarantees Granted by Guarantors Incorporated in Denmark_**

To mitigate the above-mentioned financial assistance and corporate benefit issues, a guarantee granted
by a Danish guarantor will be limited if and to the extent required to comply with Danish statutory
provisions on unlawful financial assistance and non-permitted shareholder loans including, without
limitation, Sections 206 through 212 of the Danish Companies Act. In addition, a guarantee granted by
a Danish guarantor may further be limited to a maximum amount equivalent to the higher of the equity
(egenkapital) of such guarantor (calculated in accordance with the approved accounting principles) at
the time of the granting of the guarantee, or at the time payment is requested pursuant to the guarantee.

Consequently, any guarantees and security interests provided by any Danish Guarantor will be subject
to restrictions and limitations, which may limit the value of a Guarantee issued by such Danish
Guarantor and security interest to avoid a breach of the corporate benefit requirement and to ensure
compliance with applicable restrictions on financial assistance.

**_Ownership_**

Danish law does not make any distinction between registered and beneficial ownership and if such
distinction is made under foreign law the beneficial owner will be deemed the owner under Danish law.
It is uncertain whether Danish law recognises the concept of parallel debt structures and the concept of
trusts.

**_Statutes of Limitation_**

Claims may become barred under Danish statutes of limitation or principles of passivity or may become
subject to set-off or counterclaim and a guarantee in favour of a Danish credit institution may not be
enforceable unless a claim has been made under the guarantee within six months after the due date of
the guaranteed obligation.

**_Foreign Currency_**

Under the Danish Insolvency Act, claims against the estate must be converted into DKK at the exchange
rate at the day the bankruptcy court issued a bankruptcy order against the company.

**_Enforcement of Security Interests Outside Bankruptcy_**

The parties to a security agreement can include contractually agreed enforcement procedures and, if
there are no bankruptcy proceedings, the agreed procedures will be binding on the parties. However, a
sale of assets may be voidable in a later bankruptcy proceeding if the assets were transferred below
market value or if the sale unduly benefits a creditor to the detriment of other creditors.

The agreed enforcement procedures are not binding on third-parties such as creditors that have
registered an attachment or valid security against the encumbered assets.

Such third-party attachments and rights can only be cleared through a court administered public auction.

In the absence of specifically agreed enforcement procedures, Danish law requires conduct of a public
auction in accordance with the Danish Administration of Justice Act (retsplejeloven).

Pledges of shares and accounts as well as security assignments of receivables may be enforced without
an execution order. However, at least one week’s prior notice requesting the debtor to pay the secured
debt must be given to the pledgor in respect of share pledge and account pledge by registered mail


-----

unless a sale is necessary to avoid or reduce a loss. The pre-enforcement notice period can be waived
in respect of certain financial collateral arrangements.

**_Perfection of Security Interests_**

The Collateral governed by Danish law will be granted and perfected, inter alia, in favour of the holders
of Notes represented by the Security Agent. Rules have been enacted in the Danish Capital Markets Act
(kapitalmarkedsloven) allowing representatives to hold security on behalf of holders of Notes and the
Security Agent may be appointed as representative pursuant to the Danish Capital Markets Act as set
out in further detail below. There is not yet any case law relating to this legislation confirming the right
of the representative to enforce on behalf of holders of Notes so there is a risk that enforcement may be
delayed. Absent perfection of the security interest or absent registration of the Security Agent with the
Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (Finanstilsynet), the holder of the security interest may not be
able to enforce its rights in Danish collateral against third-parties, including a bankruptcy administrator
and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same collateral. Moreover, if perfection occurs
only after the occurrence of certain events of default it will entail a hardening period (as described
above).

The perfection requirements for the security over shares to be granted in favour of the holders of the
Notes will be set out in the relevant security document, and these entail a notification to the issuer of
the shares subject to the security and the recording of the security in the shareholders’ register of the
entity subject to the security. Under Danish law, the ranking of security rights is determined by the date
on which the relevant act of perfection has been taken, and if a security interest created later in time
over that same collateral, but in respect of which the act of perfection is completed prior to perfection
of the pre-existing security interest then the security interest created later will have priority.

**_The Security Agent and the Trustee_**

The ability of the Security Agent to hold the relevant security interests over the Danish Collateral on
behalf of holders of Notes pursuant to any security document governed by Danish law as well as the
ability of the Trustee to represent and act on behalf of holders of the Notes may require registration of
the Security Agent and the Trustee with the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (Finanstilsynet).
The registration of the Security Agent as holder of Collateral with the Danish Financial Supervisory
Authority (Finanstilsynet) is, however, not a legal validity requirement for the granting and perfection
of collateral.

Under Danish law it is uncertain (i) whether the appointment of the Trustee and the Security Agent to
represent and act on behalf of the holders of Notes would be binding in the event of the bankruptcy of
a holder of Notes; (ii) whether the Trustee and the Security Agent have and will maintain the capacity
to bring proceedings and legal interest in the name or on behalf of the holders of Notes in the event of
bankruptcy a holder of Notes; (iii) whether the security and guarantees can be validly granted in favour
of the Security Agent as agent and representative on behalf of the holders of Notes; and (iv) whether
the holders of Notes can validly waive their rights to exercise their powers independently. As regards
the Notes, a Guarantee issued by a Danish Guarantor and any security document expressed to be
governed by Danish law, the above concerns regarding the ability of the Security Agent to hold a
guarantee and the relevant security interests over collateral on behalf of the holders of the Notes and
the ability of the Trustee to represent and act on behalf of the holders of Notes can be addressed by
registering the Security Agent and the Trustee with the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority
(Finanstilsynet) in accordance with the rules set out in Chapter 4 of the Danish Capital Markets Act.
No assurance is given that the Security Agent, the Trustee or the Indenture and other documents meet
the eligibility criteria for the Security Agent and/or the Trustee to be registered with the Danish
Financial Supervisory Authority (Finanstilsynet), that such registration will be obtained or, if obtained,
that it will be maintained.


-----

**_Parallel Debt_**

There is no established concept of “trust,” “trustee” or “parallel debt” under Danish law and as such
these concepts may not be recognised or enforced by Danish courts. Danish law does not make any
distinction between registered and beneficial ownership and if such distinction is made under foreign
law the beneficial owner will be deemed the owner under Danish law.

**European Union**

The Issuer and several Guarantors are organised under the laws of Member States of the European
Union.

As such, they are subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation, which applies within the European Union,
other than Denmark and pursuant to which the court that shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency
proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) where the
company concerned has its “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU
Insolvency Regulation). The determination of where a company has its “centre of main interests” is a
question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even
conflicting views. “Centre of main interests” is determined at the time the request to open the relevant
insolvency proceedings is made (where a court is involved).

Furthermore, “centre of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time. Article
3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that a company’s “centre of main interests” shall be the
place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is
ascertainable by third-parties. There is a rebuttable presumption that the Member State where the
company’s registered office is, will be its centre of main interest. However the presumption only applies
if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three month period prior
to the request for opening insolvency proceedings. The European Court of Justice has ruled that a debtor
company’s main centre of interests must be determined by attaching greater importance to the place of
the company’s central administration, as may be established by objective factors which are ascertainable
by third-parties. Where the bodies responsible for the management and supervision of a company are
in the same place as its registered office and the management decisions of the company are taken, in a
manner that is ascertainable by third-parties, in that place, the presumption, that the centre of the
company’s main interests is located in that place, shall be irrebuttable. Where a company’s central
administration is, however, not in the same place as its registered office, the presence of company assets
and existence of contracts for the financial exploitation of those assets in a Member State other than
that in which the registered office is situated cannot be regarded as sufficient factors to rebut the
abovementioned presumption, unless a comprehensive assessment of all relevant factors makes it
possible to establish, in a manner that is ascertainable by third-parties, that the company’s actual centre
of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member
State. The factors to be taken into account include, in particular, all the places in which it holds assets,
in so far as they are ascertainable by third-parties. The EU Insolvency Regulation also sets out, at
paragraph 30 of the Preamble, examples of where a presumption as to a company’s “centre of main
_interests” may be rebutted. The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings which are_
collective insolvency proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation
by reference to each applicable Member State.

If the centre of main interests of a company is and remains located in a Member State (other than
Denmark), the main insolvency proceedings in respect of such company under the EU Insolvency
Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would
be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU
Insolvency Regulation. If the “centre of main interests” of a debtor is in one Member State (other than
Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State
(other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “territorial proceedings” only in the event that such
debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined


-----

to mean any place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the three-month
period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with
human means and assets. Territorial proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A
to the EU Insolvency Regulation and, for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding-up
proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are commenced prior
to the opening of main insolvency proceedings and which will usually convert to secondary proceedings
on the opening of the main proceedings. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the
assets of the debtor located in the territory of such other Member State. If the company does not have
an establishment in any other Member State, no court of any other Member State has jurisdiction to
open territorial proceedings in respect of such company under the EU Insolvency Regulation.
Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or territorial proceedings, such proceedings
will always, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the _lex fori concursus, i.e., the local_
insolvency law of the court which has assumed jurisdiction for the insolvency proceedings of the debtor.

Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the Member State
in which the company has its centre of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency
proceedings can only be opened in another Member State (other than Denmark) where the company has
an establishment and either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which
the company’s centre of main interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial
insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in
connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State
where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (ii) a public authority which, under the law
of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request
the opening of insolvency proceedings.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognise the judgment of the court opening
main proceedings and give the same effect to the order in the other relevant Member States so long as
no secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings have been opened there.
Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency officeholder appointed by the
court in the Member State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings may exercise the
powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State in another Member State (other than
Denmark) (such as to remove assets of the company from that other Member State). These powers are
subject to certain limitations (e.g., the powers are available provided that no insolvency proceedings
have been opened in that other Member State nor has any preservation measure to the contrary been
taken there further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the
company has assets). In order to avoid the opening of secondary proceedings, the insolvency
practitioner in the main proceedings may also give a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets
located in the Member State in which secondary proceedings could be opened that, when distributing
assets or realisation proceeds, it will comply with the distribution and priority rights under national law
that creditors would have if secondary proceedings were opened in that Member State. This, however,
is subject to a “qualified majority” (as defined under national law) of known local creditors (being
creditors whose claims against a debtor arose from or in connection with the operation of an
establishment situated in a Member State other than the Member State in which the debtor’s “centre of
_main interests” is located) approving the undertaking. The law applicable to the distribution of proceeds_
and ranking of claims is also the law of the state where secondary proceedings are opened.

In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the EU Insolvency
Regulation with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency of several
members of a group of companies. Under Article 61 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, group
coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency
proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency
proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation in group coordination
proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan,
however, is voluntary.


-----

In the event that the Issuer or any Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict
with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings will be
commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the
enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors. The insolvency, administration and
other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organised or operate may be
materially different from, or conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency
laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another.

The European Commission may, from time to time, publish amendments to the EU Insolvency
Regulation which, once enacted, might alter the manner in which the test for determining where a
company has its “centre of main interests” might be applied during the term of the Notes.

**Germany**

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

Heide-Park Soltau GmbH, LEGOLAND Deutschland Freizeitpark GmbH, Legoland Deutschland
GmbH, Sea Life Deutschland GmbH, Madame Tussauds Deutschland GmbH and Dungeon
Deutschland GmbH (collectively, the “German Guarantors”), and Merlin Entertainments Group
Deutschland GmbH, Tussauds Deutschland GmbH and LLD Share GmbH & Co. KG (collectively, the
“German Security Providers,” and, together with the German Guarantors, the “German Security
_Grantors” are incorporated in the form of limited liability companies (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter_
_Haftung) (“GmbH”)_ and in the form of a limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft) with a limited
liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) as unlimited liable partner (“GmbH & Co.
_KG”). Consequently, the granting of the Guarantees and/or Collateral by each of the German Security_
Grantors is subject to certain capital maintenance rules under the German Limited Liability Company
Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung) (“GmbHG”). These provisions
would also apply to any future German Security Grantor in the form of a GmbH or a limited partnership
with a limited liability company as unlimited liable partner (e.g., GmbH & Co. KG). If the capital
maintenance rules are violated, the Issuer is liable for repayment and the directors of the German
Security Grantors are personally liable for compensation.

According to the decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) dated March 21,
2017, file no. II ZR 93/16, the granting of an in rem security (dingliche Sicherheit) for a loan repayment
claim of a security taker against the shareholder is deemed to be a prohibited payout to the detriment of
the assets that are required for the maintenance of the share capital within the meaning of section 30 (1)
sentence 1 of the German Limited Liability Company Act, if the shareholder is not expected to be able
to repay the loan and, in addition, an underbalance is created or deepened.

Therefore, in order to enable the German Security Grantor to grant guarantees and/or security interests
securing liabilities of the Issuer without the risk of violating German capital maintenance provisions
and to protect management from personal liability, it is standard market practice for credit agreements,
notes, guarantees and security documents to contain “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries, a
GmbH or a partnership with a GmbH as an unlimited liable partner incorporated or established in
Germany. Pursuant to such limitation language, the enforcement of the Guarantee and/or security
interest given by each of the German Security Grantor will be limited, reflecting the requirement under
the capital maintenance rules imposed by sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG if and to the extent
payments under any such Guarantee would cause a German Security Grantor’s net assets to fall below
the amount of its registered share capital (Stammkapital) or, if the net assets of the German Security
Grantor are already less than the stated share capital, cause the net assets to be further reduced or if and
to the extent payments under any Guarantee would deprive the German Security Grantor of the liquidity
necessary to fulfil its financial liabilities to its creditors. These limitations would, to the extent
applicable, restrict the enforcement of the relevant Guarantee.


-----

The limitation language may also restrict the enforcement if a German Security Grantor becomes
insolvent and insolvency proceedings are opened over its estate. We cannot assure you that future court
rulings may not further limit the access of the Issuer or other direct or indirect shareholders to assets of
the German Security Grantor, which can negatively affect the ability of the German Guarantors to make
payments on the Guarantee.

In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) regarding section 64 sentence 3 of the GmbHG (i.e., a situation where a managing
director makes a payment to the GmbH’s shareholder which inevitably leads to the illiquidity of the
GmbH) or a so-called “destructive interference” (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where
a shareholder deprives a German limited liability company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its
own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of the Guarantees
or security interests granted by the German Security Grantor. In such a case, the amount of proceeds to
be realised in an enforcement process may be (further) reduced (down to zero). Furthermore, according
to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be
void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial
situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral (including a
guarantee) by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that
German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of the Guarantees and/or security
interests by the German Security Grantor. Furthermore, the beneficiary (e.g., a holder of Notes) of a
transaction effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of the grantor of the Guarantees and/or
Collateral could, moreover, become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German
Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor
were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the
debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be
present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor
of the guarantee and/or security interests was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch) or had reason to
enquire further with respect thereto.

Consequently, the restrictions on enforcing the Collateral granted by a German Security Grantor is
subject to evolving court decisions. It is possible that future court rulings may further limit the access
of the Issuer or other direct or indirect shareholders to assets of the German Security Grantors.

**_Accessory security interests / Parallel debt_**

Under German law, certain security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) are of strict accessory nature
and are therefore dependent on the secured claims and require the security holder and the creditor of
the secured claim to be identical. Such accessory security interests (akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) (i)
will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claim is settled, discharged or novated, (ii) may not be
assigned independently, but would automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant
secured claim is assigned and (iii) may only be granted to the creditor of a claim to be secured by the
accessory security interest.

The accessory security interests will be granted to the Security Agent. The Security Agent is however
not a creditor under the Notes. The Holders on the other hand are creditors under the Notes and the
Guarantees but no direct beneficiaries of the security interests. In order to allow the Holders to benefit
from the pledges, such pledges are granted to the Security Agent as security for Parallel Debt created
under the Intercreditor Agreement in favour of the Security Agent rather than secure the Holders’ claims
under the Notes directly. The Parallel Debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the
obligations of the creditors under the Principal Obligations, and any payment in respect of the Principal
Obligations will discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel
Debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have,
pursuant to the Parallel Debt, a claim against the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes,
the legal concept of creating parallel debt obligations has, to our knowledge, not yet been tested before
a German court. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that such concept will not be recognized by German


-----

courts or that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of invalidity and unenforceability of pledges.
Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the collateral may be restricted.

Moreover, the Security Agent holds the pledges in trust. This means that in the case of an insolvency
of the Security Agent, the insolvency administrator over the insolvency estate of the Security Agent
may successfully claim that there is no separation right (Aussonderungsrecht) of the Holders with
respect to the secured claims. As a consequence the secured claims (including the parallel debt) and the
accessory security rights would remain with the (then insolvent) Security Agent.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—Insolvency laws and other
_limitations on the Guarantees, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their_
_validity and enforceability.”_

**_Insolvency_**

If any insolvency proceedings with regard to a German Security Grantor are initiated in Germany and
if the German Security Grantor is held to have its center of main interests according to Article 3 of the
Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on
insolvency proceedings (“EuInsVO”) within the territory of Germany at the time the application for the
opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, German insolvency law would
in principle govern such proceedings. The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions
of the German Insolvency Code (“Insolvenzordnung”, “InsO”) may not be as favourable to creditors as
the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including, inter alia, in respect of priority of creditors’ claims,
the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence
may limit the ability of creditors to recover payments due on the Notes, as applicable, to an extent
exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.

**_Brief high level description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany_**

Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that,
despite the economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one
separate insolvency proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent an insolvency reason exists
on the part of the relevant entity. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from
all other insolvency proceedings (if any) within the group. In particular, there is no consolidation of
assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency and no pooling of claims among
the respective entities of a group. In 2018, the German legislator resolved upon the act to facilitate the
mastering of group insolvencies (“Gesetz _zur_ _Erleichterung_ _der_ _Bewältigung_ _von_

_Konzerninsolvenzen”). However, this act mainly provides for coordination of and cooperation between_
insolvency proceedings of group companies. The act does not provide for a consolidation of the
insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities
of a group of companies or pooling of claims amongst the respective entities of a group, but rather
stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient
administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each group entity
insolvency proceedings; (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group
companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts,
insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for
“coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordination
_insolvency administrator” (Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan”_
(Koordinationsplan).

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency
court ex officio but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings. Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event
of overindebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event that the debtor is unable to pay its
debts as and when they fall due (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). According to the relevant provision of the


-----

German Insolvency Code, a debtor is overindebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets
(based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business as a going concern is
predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich). As a guideline, the debtor is deemed illiquid if it
is unable to pay 10% or more of its due and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks, unless
it is virtually certain that the company can close the liquidity gap shortly thereafter (demnächst) and it
can be deemed acceptable to the creditor to continue to wait for the payments owed by such debtor
(positive _Fortführungsprognose). If a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft, AG), a European law stock_
corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea, SE) or a limited liability company (Gesellschaft _mit_
_beschränkter Haftung, GmbH) or any company not having an individual as personally liable_
shareholder—such as the German Security Grantor— becomes illiquid and/or overindebted, the
management of such company and, under certain circumstances, its shareholders are obliged to file for
the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay, however, at the latest within three (3)
weeks after illiquidity occurred, six (6) weeks after over indebtedness occurred. Non-compliance with
these obligations exposes management to both severe damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal
law. Once illiquidity or over indebtedness occurred, any payments, including any payments under the
Notes, as applicable, may be voidable. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende _Zahlungsunfähigkeit)_
is a valid insolvency reason under German law which exists if the company currently is able to service
its payments obligations but will presumably not be able to continue to do so at some point in time
within the next 24 months. However, only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obliged)
to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings if the debtor has imminent illiquidity.

The formal insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court, which
monitors the due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the
insolvency court may take preliminary measures (vorläufige Maßnahmen) to secure the property of the
debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may
prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during
these preliminary proceedings. In addition, the court will generally also appoint a preliminary
insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), unless the debtor has petitioned for debtorin-possession status (Eigenverwaltung)—an insolvency process in which the debtor’s management
generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a
custodian (Sachwalter)—provided, inter alia, that no circumstances are known which lead to the
expectation that debtor-in-possession status will place the creditors at a disadvantage.

Depending on the size of the debtor’s business operations, the insolvency court must or may appoint a
_preliminary creditors’ committee (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) to form a view on a petition for_
debtor-in-possession status, or on the profile of the (preliminary) insolvency administrator to be
appointed or to suggest a particular individual to be appointed by the court.

In case the members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an individual, such
suggestion is binding on the court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible, i.e., not competent
and/or not impartial). To ensure that the preliminary creditors’ committee reflects the interests of all
creditor constituencies, it shall comprise a representative of the secured creditors, one for the large
creditors and one for the small creditors as well as one for the employees. The duties of the preliminary
insolvency administrator are, in particular to safeguard and to preserve the debtor’s assets (which may
include the continuation of the business carried out by the debtor), to verify the existence of an
insolvency reason and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of
the insolvency proceedings.

The court orders the opening (Eröffnungsbeschluss) of formal insolvency proceedings (eröffnetes
_Insolvenzverfahren) if certain requirements are met,_ _inter alia if there are sufficient assets_
(Insolvenzmasse) to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are
not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if thirdparties (e.g., creditors) advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition
for the opening of insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung
_mangels Masse)._


-----

Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (usually, but not
necessarily, the same person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the
insolvency court unless a debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In the absence of a
debtor-in-possession status, the right to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the
assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors
(Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator
at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such change
requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by head count and amount of insolvency claims) has
voted in favor of the proposed individual becoming the insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed
individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e. sufficiently qualified, business experienced and impartial.
The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to
continue the debtor’s business. These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency administrator qualify
as preferential claims against the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are preferred to any insolvency
claim of an unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining after
realization of the available collateral (if any) also qualifying as unsecured insolvency claim).

From the perspective of the holders of the Notes, among others, some important consequences of such
opening of formal insolvency proceedings against the German Security Grantor would be the following:

  - the right to administer and dispose of the assets of the German Security Grantor would
generally pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the
insolvency estate;

  - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) with respect to the
German Security Grantor, disposals effected by the management of the German Security
Grantor after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, are null and void by operation of
law;

  - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter,
a creditor in the insolvency proceedings has acquired through execution (e.g., attachment) a
security interest in part of the German Security Grantor that would normally form part of the
insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening
of formal insolvency proceedings; and

  - claims against the German Security Grantor may only be pursued in accordance with the rules
set forth in the German Insolvency Code.

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses”
entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement,
upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or
the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene
_Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the_
insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the contract unless they reflect termination rights
(Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements
that are not governed by German law.

Any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung) (i.e., the relevant asset of this person does
not constitute part of the insolvency estate) does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim
for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency
administrator.

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the
insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)),
wishing to assert claims against the insolvent debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings.
German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer


-----

pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately but can instead only enforce
them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code. Therefore, secured creditors
are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the
insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights

(Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest entitlement to enforce such
security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context, it
should be noted that the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any moveable
assets in his / the debtor’s possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable
assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte) or security transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung) as well as to
collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen)). In case
the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain
contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii)
German Security Grantor realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate,
usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds plus VAT (if any), are disbursed to the creditor
holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. With
the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the
creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency
proceedings as well as any preferred liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of
formal insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims, Insolvenzforderungen),
in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there
is value remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and the
preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full.

The right of a creditor to preferential satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the
insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency
administrator must, however, compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use.

Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be
subordinated by law (including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of
the relevant debtor for the return of funds or the payment of a consideration), while claims of a person
who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings
generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. Claims of subordinated creditors in
the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other
non-subordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied.

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against
the debtor on the date the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied
ranking below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given herein, and in proportion to
their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of
the insolvency creditors from the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by
individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines,
coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or
administrative offense binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims on the debtor’s gratuitous
performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for the restitution of shareholder loans
(Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms
to such a loan.

While in ordinary insolvency proceedings, the value of the German Security Grantor will be realized
by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of the entity’s business as a going concern, a
different approach aiming at the rehabilitation of such entities can be taken based on an insolvency plan
(Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires,
among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the German Security Grantor and
the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules and the approval of the
insolvency court (while a group of dissenting creditors or the debtor can—under certain
circumstances—be crammed down). If the debtor is a corporate entity, also the shares or, as the case


-----

may be, the membership rights in the debtor can be included in the insolvency plan, e.g., they can be
transferred to third parties, including a transfer to creditors based on a debt to equity swap. Moreover,
if the debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on an insolvency
reason other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or over indebtedness), combined with a petition
to initiate such process based on a debtor-in-possession status and can, _inter alia, prove that a_
restructuring of its business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos), the court may grant a
period of up to three months to utilize an insolvency plan for the debtor business (Schutzschirm). During
this period, the creditors’ rights to enforce security may—upon application of the filing debtor—be
suspended. Under these circumstances, the insolvency court has to appoint a custodian (Sachwalter) to
supervise the process. The debtor is entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as custodian with
such suggestion being binding on the insolvency court unless the suggested person is obviously not
eligible to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously not competent or impartial). Under the German
Insolvency Code, the insolvency administrator (or in case of debtor-in-possession proceedings, the
custodian) may void (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental
to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the commencement of formal insolvency
proceedings during applicable voidable periods. Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts
are successfully voided by the insolvency administrator, any amounts or other benefits derived from
such challenged transaction, performance or act will have to be returned to the insolvency estate. The
administrator’s right to void transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions
having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings.

In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to the German Security Grantor based on and
governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the holders could be
subject to potential challenges (i.e., clawback rights) by an insolvency administrator under the rules of
voidness as set out in the German Insolvency Code. In the event such a transaction is successfully
voided (angefochten), the holders of the Notes, as applicable, may not be able to recover or retain any
amounts under the Notes and may participate in the insolvency proceedings as unsecured creditor only.
If payments have already been made under the Notes, any amounts received from a transaction that had
been voided would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). In this case, the holders
of the Notes, as applicable, would only have a general unsecured claim under the Notes without
preference in insolvency proceedings. In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction
(Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the
payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the debtor may be voided according to the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in the following cases:

  - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security
or satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the
filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was
illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such
illiquidity (or of circumstances that clearly suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or
(ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew
of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances that clearly suggest
such illiquidity or filing);

  - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security
or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled, or which was granted or
obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such
security or satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was taken
during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at
such time or (iii) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act
was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of
circumstances that clearly suggest such detrimental effect);


-----

  - a legal transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by
which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim
against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three
months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the
debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew
of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction knew either of the debtor’s illiquidity or
of such filing at the time of the transaction;

  - any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security
for a third party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously
(unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings;

  - any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the
intention of prejudicing its insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and
the beneficiary of the act knew of such intention at the time of such act. In the case that the
relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt,
the avoidability of acts is limited to four years. “Knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” in
terms of such provision is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was illiquid and
that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors. The fact that the creditor agreed on a
payment plan with the debtor or agreed to deferred payments shall establish the presumption
that he had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at this time.

  - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party that directly
operates to the detriment of the creditors can be voided unless such contract was concluded
earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings
or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of
the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term “affiliated party”
includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board,
general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons
or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the
economic situation of the debtor, and other persons who are spouses, relatives or members of
the household of any of the foregoing persons;

  - any act that provides security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a claim of a shareholder for
repayment of a shareholder loan or a similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security,
the act took place during the last ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the
act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of the
insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition; or

  - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent
claim to a third party if (i) the satisfaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the
debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor or surety (Garant oder Bürge) (in which
case the shareholder must compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further
conditions).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from
which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell
due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was
detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person deemed
to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if he or she knew of


-----

the debtor’s imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With respect
to an “affiliated party”, there is a general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge.”

The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a “cash
_transaction” and may as such be privileged, under certain circumstances, under the German Insolvency_
Code (Bargeschäftsprivileg) by not being subject to voidness rights.

Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator voiding transactions according to the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement
order (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any security right or payment performed under the
relevant security right according to the German Law of Voidness (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal
insolvency proceedings. The prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and
the voidance periods are calculated from the date a creditor exercises its rights of voidance in the courts.

**_Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims_**

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against
the debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be
satisfied ranking below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according
to the proportion of their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued
on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs
incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines,
regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences
of a criminal or administrative offence binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s
gratuitous performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for restitution of a shareholder loan replacing
equity capital or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such a
loan.

**_German StaRUG Scheme_**

Outside of formal insolvency proceedings, an imminent illiquid company can enter into a restructuring
scheme pursuant to the German Act on the Stabilisation and Restructuring Framework for Businesses
(StaRUG). The ability of investors to enforce their rights under the German Security Agreements and
obtain recovery of amounts due and owing under the Notes could also be adversely affected by the
StaRUG restructuring measures, _inter alia, by the implementation of a restructuring plan and_
stabilization measures, in particular a general or individual stay.

During the StaRUG restructuring proceedings, the company can implement restructuring measures by
way of majority vote of the creditors in classes, i.e. even dissenting creditors within a class (cram-down)
and dissenting classes of creditors (cross-class cram-down) may be bound to restructuring measures,
relating to, _inter alia, and including haircuts of unsecured and secured claims and notes, change of_
ownership interests etc.

After the company has given notice to the restructuring court the company can request stabilizing
measures pursuant to section 49 StaRUG (Stabilisierungsanordnung) if they are necessary to preserve
the prospects of achieving the restructuring goal, i.e. a general or individual stay for a duration of up to
three months but no longer than eight months. If the competent court approves the request, enforcement
measures against the company will be prohibited or discontinued on an interim basis
(Vollstreckungssperre) and rights for preferential satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) or right to
segregation (Aussonderungsrecht) in the event that insolvency proceedings are opened may not be
claimed by the creditor and that the assets subject to those rights may be used to continue the debtor’s
business to the extent that they are of considerable significance for this purpose (Verwertungssperre).
Additionally, section 55 StaRUG stipulates that at the time the stabilization order is issued, the creditor
will not be entitled solely on the basis of overdue performance to refuse performance to be rendered by
it during the duration of the order or assert rights to terminate or modify the contract; this will not affect


-----

the right of the creditor to refuse to provide that part to the counter-performance that is to be rendered
by it in relation to the debtor’s overdue performance.

**Italy**

**_Limitation on Granting of Guarantees and on Enforcement under Italian Law_**

Under Italian law, the entry into of a transaction (including the creation of a security interest or the
granting of a guarantee) by a company incorporated under Italian law must be permitted by the
applicable laws and by its by-laws (statuto sociale) and is subject to compliance with rules on corporate
benefits, corporate authorisation and certain other Italian mandatory provisions. If a guarantee or a
security interest is being provided in the context of an acquisition, group reorganization or restructuring,
financial assistance issues may also be triggered.

An Italian company (each an “Italian Guarantor”) granting a guarantee must receive a real and adequate
benefit in exchange for the guarantee. Such principle on corporate benefit applies equally to downstream, cross-stream and up-stream guarantees granted by Italian companies. While the existence of a
corporate benefit in relation to a downstream guarantee is usually self-evident (i.e., a guarantee
guaranteeing financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant guarantor), the
existence of a corporate benefit in relation to a cross-stream or an up-stream guarantee (i.e., a guarantee
guaranteeing financial obligations of direct or indirect parent companies or sister companies of the
relevant guarantor) may be challenged unless it can be proved that the guarantor may derive some
benefits or advantages from the granting of the guarantee, therefore it should be carefully considered
on a case-by-case basis (such as in the case of Subsidiary Guarantors which are providing the
Guarantees in connection with the Notes offered hereby).

The concept of “corporate benefit” is not expressly defined under Italian law and it is assessed and
determined on a case-by-case basis, further its existence is purely a business decision of the directors
and the statutory auditors. As a general rule, corporate benefit is assessed at the level of the relevant
company on a standalone basis, although in certain circumstances, and subject to specific rules, the
interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. In particular,
in case of up-stream and cross-stream guarantees for the financial obligations of group companies,
examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany
loans from other members of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to
shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to
whether and to what extent such transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and
conflict of interest. Generally, the risk assumed by an Italian Guarantor must not be disproportionate to
the direct or indirect economic benefit to such Italian Guarantor.

In principle, absence of a real and adequate benefit could make the Guarantees ultra vires and potentially
affected by conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and
directors may be subject matter of challenges and annulment.

As a result, civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian Guarantor if it is assessed that
they did not act in the best interest of such Italian Guarantor and that the acts they carried out do not
fall within the corporate purpose of the relevant Italian Guarantor or were against mandatory provisions
of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on
those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over an Italian Guarantor or having knowingly
received an advantage or profit from such improper control. However, no liability can be attributed
where no prejudice or actual damage is suffered by the Italian Guarantor because of the determination
of the controlling shareholder as provided under Article 2497 of the Italian Civil Code having regard to
the overall result of the controlling activity. Moreover, the Guarantees could be declared null and void
if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third-party involved in the
transaction and such third-party acted intentionally against the interest of such Italian Guarantor.


-----

The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, down-stream or cross-stream
guarantees granted by an Italian Guarantor.

As to corporate authorisations prospective, the granting of a guarantee by an Italian company in favour
of third-parties or other corporations belonging to the same group of companies of the Italian Guarantor
must be permitted by the by-laws (statuto) of the Italian company providing such guarantee.

In addition, the granting of a guarantee by an Italian company cannot include any liability which would
result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or 2474, as the case may be,
of the Italian Civil Code pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions, it is unlawful for a company
to give financial assistance (whether by means of loans, security, guarantees or otherwise) to support
the acquisition or subscription by a third-party of its own shares or quotas or those of any entity that
(directly or indirectly) controls the Italian company. Financial assistance for refinancing indebtedness
originally incurred for the purchase or subscription of its own shares or quotas or those of its direct or
indirect parent company would also be a violation. Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in
breach of these provisions is null and void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to
act in the best interests of the company.

In the light of the above, in no event shall the obligations and liabilities of an Italian Guarantor under a
guarantee include the obligation to guarantee financial indebtedness which was incurred, in full or in
part, to purchase the shares of such Italian Guarantor (or of any of its direct or indirect holding company)
and which would therefore constitute the provision of financial assistance within the meaning of Article
2358 and/or Article 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code and/or any other law or regulation
having the same effect, as interpreted by Italian courts.

If the proceeds of the Notes were to be used for the acquisition of shares (or quotas, as applicable) in
the Subsidiary Guarantors (the entities which, amongst others, provided the Guarantees) incorporated
in Italy (or of any of its direct or indirect holding company), this may be construed as a violation of
Article 2474 and/or Article 2358 of the Italian Civil Code whereas, in the latter case, an authorisation
proceeding in the shareholders’ meeting is not implemented. To this extent the total value of the
guarantee cannot exceed the profits and the distributable reserves as resulting from the approved
financial statements.

Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity
within the meaning of Article 106 of the Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993 (the “Italian
_Banking Act”), whose exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and authorised financial_
intermediaries. Non-compliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, inter alia, entail
the Guarantees being considered null and void. In this respect, the Ministerial Decree No. 53 of 2 April
2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of
guarantees or security by a company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same
group does not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and
controlled companies within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies,
which are under the control of the same entity. As a result of the above described rules, subject to the
Italian Guarantor and the guaranteed entity being part of the same group of companies, the provision of
the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial activity.

In addition, under Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a personal guarantee is issued to guarantee
conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum
amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee
deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). It has been held, that such
determination must be proportionate to the relevant guarantor’s assets. It is uncertain, however, whether
courts are entitled to debate and to rule over such determination.

Italian Law No. 108 of 7 March 1996, as amended, implemented or supplemented from time to time
(the “Italian Usury Law”), prevents lenders from applying interests higher than certain rates, as set forth


-----

in accordance with the Italian Usury Law (the “Usury Rates”). In addition, even where the Usury Rates
are not exceeded, the interest rate applicable may be held usurious if: (i) it is considered to be
disproportionate to the amount lent (taking into account the specific circumstances of the transaction
and the average rate applicable to similar transactions in the market) and (ii) the debtor is deemed to
have been in financial and economic difficulties at the time the indebtedness was incurred.

In order to comply with (i) the Italian Usury Law and Article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii)
the mandatory provisions of Italian law in relation to capitalization of interests (including Article 1283
of the Italian Civil Code), the obligations of any Italian Guarantor under a guarantee shall not include
and shall not extend to (x) Usury Rates and (y) any interest on overdue amounts compounded in
violation of the provisions set forth by Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, respectively.

In any event, pursuant to Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, a guarantee granted by an Italian
Guarantor must be capped to a maximum guaranteed amount.

**_Certain Italian Insolvency Law Considerations_**

The Italian laws and regulations on insolvency have recently been replaced by a new comprehensive
regulatory framework in order to regulate, inter alia, the matter of insolvency (the so-called “Codice
_della crisi d’impresa e dell’insolvenza”, hereinafter the “Insolvency Code”). In particular, on 12 January_
2019, the Italian Government approved Legislative Decree No. 14 of 12 January 2019 implementing
the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 of 19 October 2017, setting forth the outline of a new
comprehensive regulatory framework for the purpose of regulating, inter alia, the matter of insolvency
(the “Legislative Decree”), which enacts the Insolvency Code.

The main changes introduced by the Insolvency Code include: (i) the suppression of the term
“bankrupt” because of its negative connotation and the replacement of the bankruptcy procedure
(bankruptcy) with a judicial liquidation; (ii) a new definition of “state of crisis”; (iii) the endorsement
of the same procedural framework for the ascertainment of such state of crisis and for admission to the
different judicial insolvency procedures set forth in the Insolvency Code itself; (iv) the introduction of
the definition of the debtor’s centre of main interests’ as provided for in the new set of rules on group
restructurings; (v) restrictions on the use of composition with creditors in order to promote business
continuity; (vi) the introduction of provisions dedicated to groups of companies; (vii) the competence
of specialist courts for proceedings involving major debtors; (viii) the introduction of specific
provisions in relation to the adoption of measures and agreements aimed at the early detection of
business crisis; and (ix) amendments to certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code aimed at ensuring
the general effectiveness of the reform. The Insolvency Code was amended and supplemented, inter
alia, by Legislative Decree No. 147 of 26 October 2020 (as amended and supplemented, most recently,
by Legislative Decree No. 83 of 17 June 2022), providing the first corrective intervention to the
Insolvency Code.

The following is a brief description of the main provisions of the types of procedures under the
Insolvency Code, which replaced the Royal Decree no. 267 of 16 March 1942 (the “Bankruptcy Law”)
after the Insolvency Code came into force (on 15 July, 2022):

- judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) under the Insolvency Code;

- composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) under the Insolvency Code;

- negotiated crisis composition procedure (composizione negoziata per la crisi di impresa) under the
Insolvency Code;

- simplified composition with creditors proceeding (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del
patrimonio) under the Insolvency Code;


-----

- certified restructuring plans (piani attestati di risanamento) under the Insolvency Code;

- debt-restructuring agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) under the Insolvency Code;

- restructuring plans subject to homologation (piani di ristrutturazione soggetti a omologazione)
under the Insolvency Code.

The aforementioned restructuring/insolvency tools are available under the Insolvency Code for
insolvent companies or debtors in a state of crisis, as the case may be, and, in some cases, also for
debtors whose economic or financial imbalance is such that a state of crisis and/or distress or their
insolvency is likely to occur. For the sake of completeness, it should be noted that the Insolvency Code
also provides for a simplified arrangement with creditors (concordato minore), in cases where the debtor
does not meet the size requirements for access to other restructuring instruments, which follows the
main procedural steps and effects provided for the composition with creditors (concordato preventivo),
but includes the involvement and assistance to the debtor of the crisis resolution body (organismo di
_risoluzione della crisi)._

In addition, the following is a brief summary of the procedures, which are still available to major
companies even in the framework of the new rules provided by the reform process.

- extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle
grandi imprese insolventi), under the Decree 270; and

- extraordinary administration for the industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies
(amministrazione straordinaria per la ristrutturazione industriale delle grandi imprese insolventi),
under the Law Decree No. 39 of 18 February 2004, as amended (“Decree 347”). For businesses
performing essential public services, this type of proceedings would also be subject to the Law
Decree 134 of 28 August 2008 (“Decree 134”).

Below there is a summary description of the compulsory liquidation procedure as well (procedura di
_liquidazione coatta amministrativa)._

**_Definition of “insolvency” and “crisis” under the Insolvency Code_**

The Insolvency Code introduced a specific definition of a crisis, which is defined in Article 2 (a) of the
Insolvency Code as the debtor’s state such that insolvency is considered as likely, manifesting as the
inadequacy of prospective cash flows to meet obligations in the following 12 months.

Insolvency is defined by Article 2 (b) of the Insolvency Code as the debtor’s inability to meet its
obligations regularly as they fall due, as evidenced by defaults and/or other exogenous factors.

Both insolvency and crisis are factual situations upon the occurrence of which several instruments
provided for in the Insolvency Code can be triggered.

**_The Judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) under the Insolvency Code_**

The Judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) under the Insolvency Code is a court-supervised
procedure aimed at the liquidation of the assets of the insolvent company and the distribution of the
relevant income.

Under the Insolvency Code, judicial liquidation is declared by the competent court and is enforceable
by satisfying the following two requirements:

(i) an objective requirement, which is met if any of the following criteria is met, and specifically:


-----

(a) annual assets (attivo patrimoniale) exceeding 300,000 euros in the last three financial years
(as of the date of filing of the petition for judicial liquidation) or since the company’s
incorporation if the company was incorporated less than three years prior to the filing of the
petition for judicial liquidation;

(b) annual gross revenues (ricavi lordi) exceeding 200.000 in the last three financial years (as
of the date of filing of the petition for judicial liquidation) or since the company’s
incorporation if the company was incorporated less than three years prior to the filing of the
petition for judicial liquidation; or

(c) indebtedness (including debt that is not overdue and payable) greater than 500,000 euros;
and

(ii) a subjective requirement, which is satisfied when the debtor is a commercial company

(imprenditori commerciali) engaged in business activity and is insolvent.

Judicial liquidation is opened and declared by the competent courts following a request specifically
filed by (i) the debtor itself; (ii) the administrative bodies and authorities that have functions of control
and supervision over the company; (iii) one or more creditors; and (iv) in certain cases, the Public
Prosecutor.

With the opening of judicial liquidation proceedings, the courts appoint (among other things) a receiver,
as well as the debtor loses management control over all of its assets and the administration of its
business, which is assumed by the court-appointed receiver.

In principle, as of the date of the opening of the judicial liquidation, a suspension of action shall apply,
and executive and provisional proceedings cannot be initiated or continued against the debtor on the
assets included in the estate. And specifically, at the opening of the judicial liquidation, inter alia:

(i) with some exceptions, all creditor actions are suspended, and creditors must file claims within a

specified period;

(ii) the debtor’s administration and management of its assets are transferred to the receiver. The debtor

can no longer legally act as a plaintiff or defendant in court in relation to the assets, and the receiver
is granted these powers by permission of the delegated judge. However, all pending proceedings
in which the debtor is involved are automatically suspended from the date of the issuance of the
judgment and must be resumed by or against the receiver;

(iii) the business continuation may be authorized by the court, but only if the business continuation does

not lead to damages to creditors. If the court authorizes the continuation of the business (esercizio
_provvisorio dell’impresa), the management is entrusted to the curator (who may himself use third_
parties qualified for this scope);

(iv) any act (including payments, pledges, and the giving of guarantees/security) performed by the

debtor, except those carried out through the receiver, after (and in some cases even before for a
limited period of time) the opening of the judicial liquidation becomes (or may become if
performed before) ineffective against creditors and/or may be recovered; and

(v) the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions in progress at the date of the bankruptcy filing

is suspended until the receiver has decided whether to enter into them. While the general rule is
that the receiver may continue or terminate contracts in which some or all of the obligations have
not been performed by both parties, some contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided
for in the Insolvency Code. In order to overcome the uncertainty that may be foreseeably arising,
the other party to the contract may file a written request asking the court to grant the receiver a
time limit of no more than 60 days; within that period, the receiver must decide whether to enter
into the agreement or to terminate it. After the deadline expires without the receiver responding to
the other party’s request, the pending agreement is considered terminated. Even though the general


-----

rule is that the receiver may resolve agreements in which some or all of the obligations have not
been fulfilled, some agreements are subject to special rules expressly set forth in the Insolvency
Code.

Specific exceptions in law apply to certain claims secured by mortgages, pledges or guarantees
including, among others:

(i) mortgages securing loans pursuant to Articles 38 et seq. of the Legislative Decree September 1,

1993, n. 385 (“Consolidated Banking Act”) (so called “mutuo fondiario”): such mortgages may be
enforced by the lender even after the opening of judicial liquidation against the debtor;

(ii) pledges under Decree no. 170 dated 21 May 2004 (so called “financial pledge” (pegno

_finanziario)): on the occurrence of an enforcement event, the related secured creditor may instantly_
sell the pledged financial assets and hold an amount equal to the secured obligation, although
bankruptcy proceedings have been opened;

(iii) pledges on movable property: creditors secured by pledges on the debtor’s movable property may

be authorized to sell the pledged assets during the proceeding, subject to admission to the
bankruptcy estate (ammissione allo stato passivo) under collateral rank;

(iv) third-party guarantees: even after the opening of the judicial liquidation, creditors may choose to

enforce any guarantees (and/or security interests) provided by third parties in the interest of the
bankrupt debtor.

Regarding claims against the judicial liquidation procedure, each creditor must file his or her claims
with the competent court. The creditor’s filing of proof of claim is necessary to prove the creditor’s
right to participate in the liquidation, the amount of his claim, and his standing. The judge delegated
(Giudice delegato) by the court, upon the proposal of the liquidator, will decide which claims are
admitted to the statement of liabilities (stato passivo), for what amount they are admitted, and whether
the claims are to be qualified as secured or unsecured. Any creditor may challenge (opposizione) the
judge’s decision before the court. The same procedure also applies to physical and legal persons
claiming the right to obtain the return of assets. The sale of the debtor’s assets is carried out by the
liquidator-or the delegate-through public auctions, in accordance with a liquidation program proposed
by the receiver and approved by the creditors’ committee. The creditors are then refunded with the
proceeds of the liquidation, which is managed by the receiver in accordance with the principle of equal
treatment of creditors (so-called par condicio creditorum) and in keeping with the legal order of priority
among creditors.

Further to the above, it should be noted that at the opening of the judicial liquidation, certain acts,
payments, guarantees, or security interests may be declared ineffective and/or revoked under the
Insolvency Code.

The transactions that can be annulled through a bankruptcy claw-back action under Article 166 of the
Insolvency Code can be divided into two categories:

(i) transactions that can be annulled by the receiver unless the counterparty can prove that it had no

knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency (Article 166(1) of the Insolvency Code), and specifically:

(a) transactions at a lower value made after the filing followed by the opening of judicial
liquidation proceedings or in the previous year (this period is extended to 2 years for
intercompany transactions);

(b) repayment of a debt by means other than money or other common methods of payment after
the filing followed by the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or in the previous
year (such term is extended to 2 years for intercompany transactions);


-----

(c) pledges and voluntary mortgages created in the year preceding the filing of judicial
liquidation petition to secure pre-existing debts not yet overdue;

(d) pledges and judicial or voluntary mortgages created after the filing followed by the opening
of the judicial liquidation proceeding or in the prior six months (such term is extended to 1
year for intercompany transactions);

(ii) transactions made after the filing followed by the opening of judicial liquidation proceedings or

within the preceding six months, which may be annulled if the receiver proves that the other party
had knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency (Article 166(2) of the Insolvency Code) and, in
particular:

(a) payments of debts due and payable;

(b) transactions for valuable consideration;

(c) transactions creating priority rights/security interests relating to simultaneously incurred
debts.

In addition to the above, under article 166 of the Insolvency Code, the following operations are exempt
from claw back actions:

(i) payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business in accordance with

customary market standards;

(ii) a transfer to a bank account (rimesse effettuate su un conto corrente bancario); on condition that

it does not substantially and permanently reduce the entity’s debt to the bank;

(iii) a sale, including a sale and purchase agreement registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian

Civil Code, carried out for fair value and involving a residential property intended as the principal
residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of relationship) or a nonresidential property intended as the principal place of business of the purchaser; provided that, as
of the date of the declaration of insolvency, business is actually carried on there or investments
have been made there for the start-up of such business;

(iv) entered into transactions, payments made or guarantees granted in respect of the debtor’s assets,

provided that they concern the implementation of a certified plan of rehabilitation (piano attestato
_di risanamento) pursuant to Articles 56 or 284 of the Insolvency Code;_

(v) a stipulated transaction, payment made or guarantee or security interest granted in the context of

composition proceedings (concordato preventivo), a restructuring plan subject to approval (piano
_di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) under Article 64-bis of the Insolvency Code or_
approved debt restructuring agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti omologati) and/or
stipulated transactions, payments made and security lawfully granted by the debtor after the filing
of an application for composition proceedings (concordato preventivo) or a debt restructuring
agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti). The exemption also operates for ordinary clawback;

(vi) payments of compensation to employees and consultants of the entity in connection with work

performed by them; and

(vii) payments of a debt immediately due, payable, and made on the due date in connection with

services required for access to restructuring and insolvency facilities under the Insolvency Code.

Pursuant to Article 170 of the Insolvency Code, the limitation period for starting a claw-back action is
three years from the opening of the judicial liquidation proceedings or five years from the act or
transaction to be recovered, whichever is earlier. In case the judicial liquidation is opened after the filing


-----

of a petition for admission to insolvency proceedings, pursuant to Article 170(2) of the Insolvency
Code, the limitation period shall be calculated backward from the date of filing of such petition.

Pursuant to Article 165 of the Insolvency Code, which refers back to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil
Code (which - in turn - provides for an ordinary and general claw-back action (azione revocatoria
_ordinaria) - which can be exercised against the debtor (and its counterparty) even if no judicial_
liquidation proceedings are pending), acts by which the debtor disposes of its assets (other than
payments of sums due and payable) may be revoked if the receiver can demonstrate that the debtor was
aware of the prejudice that such act would cause to his creditors (including future creditors, to the extent
that the act was done for the purpose of causing such prejudice) and, to the extent that the act was
unrewarding, the other party was aware of such prejudice.

In addition, pursuant to article 163 of the Insolvency Code, subject to certain limited exception, all
transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the
debtor after the filing to the relevant court followed by the opening of the judicial winding-up procedure
or within the two years preceding the opening of such insolvency proceeding. Any asset subject to a
transaction which is ineffective pursuant to article 163 of the Insolvency Code becomes part of the
liquidation estate by operation of law upon registration of the court’s decision opening the insolvency
proceeding (trascrizione della sentenza che ha dichiarato l’apertura della procedura concorsuale),
without needing to wait for the ineffectiveness of the transaction to be sanctioned by a court. Any
interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge as a violation of law.

In addition, pursuant to Article 164 of the Insolvency Code, among other things, the following are
ineffective against creditors:

(i) payments of claims overdue on or after the day of the declaration of the opening of judicial

liquidation, if made by the debtor after the filing of the petition followed by the opening of the
insolvency proceeding or in the prior two-year period; and

(ii) payments made by the debtor in connection with any intercompany loan, if made by the debtor

after the filing of the petition followed by the opening of insolvency proceedings or in the preceding
year.

The Insolvency Code contains special regimes for preferences and avoidance of intercompany
transactions. Specifically, under Article 290 of the Insolvency Code, the statute of limitations for
initiating intra-group claw-back actions (which refer to acts and transactions carried out by companies
within the same group that have resulted in shifting resources to another group company to the detriment
of creditors, subject to certain exceptions) is extended to five years from the filing of the judicial
liquidation.

Article 2929-bis of the Italian Civil Code (introduced by Law 132/2015) provides for a “simplified”
claw-back action with reference to certain typologies of operations conducted by the debtor without any
consideration and with the purpose of removing registered assets from foreclosure by its creditors. The
creditor may initiate enforcement proceedings on the assets in question without having previously
obtained a court decision removing or annulling the fraudulent transaction in question. In the case of
gratuitous transactions, enforcement action may also be brought by the creditor against the third-party
purchaser.

According to Italian law, the income from the sale of the debtor’s assets is distributed according to the
legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can depart from these priority rules by proposing
its own priority of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on principles of equitable
subordination (consequently, it should be noted that payment priorities such as those commonly
provided for in intercreditor contractual agreements cannot be enforced against an Italian judicial
liquidation estate to the extent that they conflict with the priorities provided by law). The law creates a
priority of claims that must be respected in the distribution of proceeds from the sale of all or part of


-----

the debtor’s assets, or of a single asset. According to Article 221 of the Insolvency Code, among other
things, the income from the liquidation of the assets must be distributed in the following order: (i) for
the payment of preferential claims (crediti prededucibili), including, among others, claims originated
by the insolvency proceedings, such as expenses related to the proceedings; (ii) for the payment of
preferential claims, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of claims of unsecured
creditors (creditori chirigrafari).

Under Italian law, the claims with the highest priority (after payment of court costs) are the claims of
preferential creditors, including, among others, claims whose priority is legally vested (e.g., repayment
of salvage or provisional financing), claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security institutions,
and claims for employees’ wages. The remaining priority claims are, in order of priority, those related
to secured creditors (creditori privilegiati); a preference in payment in most, but not exclusively,
provided for by law, mortgages (creditori ipotecari), pledges (creditori pignoratizi), and, finally,
unsecured creditors (creditori chirigrafari).

**_Bankruptcy composition agreement with creditors (concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale)_**

According to Article 240 of the Insolvency Code, judicial liquidation proceedings may be concluded
prior to liquidation through an arrangement in bankruptcy (concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale),
provided certain requirements are met. The relevant application may be presented by one or more
creditors or third parties after the judicial liquidation is opened and even before the decree declaring the
effectiveness of the statement of liabilities (decreto che rende esecutivo lo stato passivo) is issued, as
long as, on the basis of the available accounting data and other relevant information, the receiver can
establish a temporary list of creditors to be submitted to the delegated judge for approval, while the
debtor (or its subsidiaries or jointly controlled companies) may submit such a proposal only after one
year from the judgment under which the judicial liquidation was opened, but within two years from the
decree declaring the effectiveness of the statement of liabilities (decreto che rende esecutivo lo stato
_passivo), on condition that the proposal includes the provision of funds that will increase the value of_
assets by at least 10%.

The proposal shall be submitted to the competent judge, shall then be approved by the creditors and
finally by the court. In case the court’s decree approving the bankruptcy composition agreement with
creditors (concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale) becomes final (definitivo), the court declares the
judicial liquidation to be closed and terminated, initiating the enactment phase of the bankruptcy
composition agreement with creditors. In the context of a bankruptcy composition agreement with
creditors (concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale), the competent court supervises both the proposal
and execution phases while the judicial receiver, once the liquidation is closed, loses his management
functions and retains only supervisory duties over the fulfillment of the terms and the conditions of the
arrangement obligations arising from or in connection with the bankruptcy composition agreement with
creditors (concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale).

The proposal may provide for:

(i) the subdivision of creditors into different classes according to homogeneous legal position and

economic interests;

(ii) differential treatment between creditors belonging to different classes, indicating the reasons of

such differences;

(iii) debts’ rescheduling and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner, including, by way of

example, by assignment of assets, assumption (accollo) as well as by means of other extraordinary
transactions, including the assignment to creditors (as well as to companies in which they have an
interest), of shares, quotas or bonds, including those convertible into shares or other financial
instruments and debt securities.


-----

The petition may also contemplate the option for secured claims to be paid only in part. However, it is
necessary for the relevant proposal that the plan provides for their satisfaction to an extent not less than
that realizable, due to the preferential placement, from the corresponding income in the event of judicial
liquidation, having regard to the value in the market attributable to the assets or rights on which the
cause of pre-emption exists.

The proposed bankruptcy composition agreement with creditors (concordato nella liquidazione
_giudiziale) must have the approval of the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding most of the_
claims (and, in case of class formation, most of the claims of the majority of the classes). Secured
creditors have no right to vote on the proposal unless (i) they waive their security interest; or (ii) the
bankruptcy composition agreement with creditors provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of
the fair market value of their secured assets (note that such value must be assessed by an independent
expert), in which case they may vote only with respect to the portion of their debt affected by the
proposal. Final confirmation by the court is also required.

The bankruptcy composition agreement with creditors (concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale), once
approved and homologated, is mandatory for: (i) all creditors existing prior to the opening of the judicial
liquidation proceedings; and (ii) creditors who have not filed for admission to the judicial liquidation
estate, to whom the security interests or guarantees provided by third parties in the bankruptcy
arrangement (concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale) do not extend.

At the end of the judicial liquidation - following the homologation decree (decreto di omologa), which
pursuant to Article 247 of the Insolvency Code may be appealed and filed within 30 days of its
notification - the debtor returns “in bonis.”

**_Composition with creditors (concordato preventivo) under the Insolvency Code_**

Prior to the opening of judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale), a debtor that is in a situation of
crisis or insolvency may file an application for composition with creditors (“concordato preventivo”)
under the Insolvency Code in order to settle its overall indebtedness and/or restructure its business,
thereby avoiding the declaration of insolvency and the opening of bankruptcy proceedings.

The proposal for composition may be submitted by a commercial enterprise (imprenditore
_commerciale) that exceeds one of the following thresholds: (i) annual assets (attivo patrimoniale)_
exceeding 300,000 euros in the last three financial years (from the date of submission of the petition for
judicial winding-up) or since the incorporation of the company if it was incorporated less than three
years prior to the petition for composition; (ii) annual gross revenues (ricavi lordi) exceeding 200,000
euros in the last three financial years (from the date of submission of the petition for composition) or
since the incorporation of the company if the company was incorporated less than three years prior to
the petition for composition; and (iii) indebtedness (including debts that are not due and payable)
exceeding 500,000 euros.

Only the debtor itself may file the composition petition before the court located at the place where the
debtor’s head office is located.

The petition for composition must be accompanied by a series of mandatory documents and
attachments, including, inter alia, a reorganisation plan, the contents of which must meet the specific
requirements set forth in the Insolvency Code, including, but not limited to, a description of the reasons
why the company is in a difficult situation, a description of the group and the company’s business, and
the liquidation value of the company’s assets in a court-ordered liquidation scenario, the content of the
restructuring proposal to the creditors and a report prepared by an independent third-party expert
meeting certain professional requirements certifying the veracity of the data on which the plan is based
and its feasibility, a copy of the company’s financial statements for the last three financial years, as well
as the company’s up-to-date economic and financial accounts, an exhaustive description of the
company’s assets and a list of the company’s creditors, indicating their names, the amount of their


-----

claims and the ranking of those claims. In addition, pursuant to the Insolvency Code, the debtor must
file a report describing all acts and transactions exceeding the ordinary course of business performed
by the company in the preceding five years; a description of possible actions for damages, as well as
possible recovery actions and lawsuits that could be brought against the company and its corporate
bodies in a judicial liquidation scenario; and, if the company belongs to a group, some additional
information on the group itself.

Pursuant to Articles 39 para. 3 and 44 of the Insolvency Code, the debtor may submit a ‘preliminary
and simplified application’ for admission to the arrangement procedure (so-called ‘concordato in
_bianco’ or ‘concordato con riserva’), i.e. he may request the court to grant a time limit - from a_
minimum of 30 days to a maximum of 60 days - within which to file the ‘complete application’,
including the arrangement plan and all other necessary documents. In the case of filing a ‘simplified
application’, the company need only attach to the relevant application: (i) a copy of the company’s
financial statements for the last three financial years; and (ii) a list of the company’s creditors, indicating
the name of the relevant creditor, the amount and ranking of its claim against the company, as well as
its digital domicile (domicilio digitale). According to the Insolvency Code, within the aforementioned
time limit the company also has the option to file (instead of the application for full arrangement) a
petition for approval of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 57 of the Insolvency Code
or approval of a restructuring plan subject to homologation pursuant to Article 64-bis of the Insolvency
Code. This time limit may be extended once for a further maximum of 60 days upon request of the
undertaking, provided that there are reasonable grounds (giustificati motivi) for such extension and that
no petitions for the opening of judicial liquidation are pending against the undertaking. If the debtor
fails to file the proposal, plan, expert’s report and other documents within the prescribed time limit, the
court shall not admit the debtor’s request and, if the criteria set forth in the Insolvency Code are met,
the court may open the compulsory liquidation upon request of a creditor or the public prosecutor. After
the court’s grant the time limit and until its expiration, the debtor must comply with the monthly
information undertakings set forth by the court, including, inter alia, the information undertakings
relating to the debtor’s financial management and the activities carried out to finalise the debtor’s
reorganisation plan and proposal to creditors. In addition, the debtor must file an updated report on the
company’s financial situation with the court on a monthly basis, which is then published in the
competent commercial register.

After the court’s grant of the time limit and until its expiration, the debtor must comply with the monthly
information undertakings set forth by the court, including, inter alia, the information undertakings
relating to the debtor’s financial management and the activities carried out to finalise the debtor’s
reorganisation plan and proposal to creditors. In addition, the debtor must file an updated report on the
company’s financial situation to the court on a monthly basis, which is then published in the competent
commercial register. Pending the aforementioned deadline, the debtor may carry out both ordinary
management activities and urgent extraordinary management activities, provided that, in the latter case,
it has been duly authorised in advance by the Court. After the filing of the preliminary and simplified
petition by the company, a Prejudicial Commissioner (pre-commissario giudiziale) is appointed, who
will supervise the proceedings and will have to examine - inter alia and jointly with the Court – all
claims of the company relating to the performance of extraordinary management activities. All thirdparty claims that may arise from acts legally performed by the debtor after the filing will be considered
super-senior (prededucibili).

The petition for composition is published by the debtor in the commercial register by the court registry
and communicated to the public prosecutor. From the date of such publication to the date of approval
of the composition agreement by the court, pre-existing creditors may not obtain security rights (unless
authorized by the court in advance) and mortgages registered within 90 days prior to the date of
publication of the composition agreement application in the commercial register are ineffective against
such pre-existing creditors.

Pursuant to Article 54(2) of the Insolvency Code, provided that the application for admission to the
composition procedure contains the relevant request for precautionary measures, from the date of


-----

publication of the application in the commercial register it is prohibited to initiate or prosecute
enforcement and precautionary measures (or, in any event, to engage in any initiative prohibited by the
relevant measures). The final decision on such an application (which is provisionally effective as of its
publication in the commercial register) shall be taken by the competent court and the duration of the
stay of the action shall be a maximum of four months (subject to extensions in certain circumstances,
in any event not exceeding a total period of twelve months). During the pendency of the action, inter
alia, the court may not open judicial liquidation. Precautionary measures may be revoked by the courts
upon the occurrence of certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, the discovery of fraudulent
acts by the debtor. The debtor may request, with a subsequent application, the granting of additional
protective measures to prevent certain actions of one or more creditors from prejudicing the successful
outcome of the steps taken to settle the crisis or insolvency at the negotiation stage. The aforementioned
measures may also be required by the debtor pursuant to Article 44 of the Insolvency Code, together
with a preliminary and simplified application for access to one of the restructuring instruments provided
for in the Insolvency Code. Unless specific provisions of the law or collective agreements (contratti
_collettivi) apply, a company employing more than 15 employees must inform the trade union_
representatives concerned in writing of the decisions taken during the drafting of the composition plan
and which have an impact on the employment contracts of a certain number of employees, including in
the event that such decisions affect work organisation and/or working arrangements. Trade union
representatives may request a meeting with the company within 3 days of receiving such notice and the
subsequent consultation between the parties shall commence within 5 days thereafter and – unless
otherwise agreed – shall last no longer than 10 days.

In addition to the above, at the time of the filing of the application for the arrangement (including the
filing of a simplified petition), inter alia (i) as a general rule, the company’s pecuniary obligations are
deemed due on the date of the filing of the arrangement; (ii) set-off is permitted only if (a) all
claims/debts subject to set-off arose prior to the filing date; or (b) all claims/debts subject to set-off
arose after the filing date; (iii) the accrual of interest on unsecured claims is suspended. Interest on
secured claims will continue to accrue according to the specific rules set forth in the Insolvency Code.

Any act, payment or security executed or created after the submission of the request for composition
with creditors (concordato preventivo) and in accordance with its rules and procedures shall be exempt
from claw-back action. The debtor shall also be exempt from certain bankruptcy offences provided for
in Articles 322(3) (“preferential bankruptcy”) and 323 (“simple bankruptcy”) of the Insolvency Code,
in relation to acts and payments made in execution of the composition agreement and/or in relation to
financing provided pursuant to Article 99 of the Insolvency Code with judicial authorisation. Claims
arising from acts lawfully performed by the company in crisis have absolute priority (prededucibili) in
the event of subsequent judicial liquidation.

The composition plan may be aimed at (i) the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity (socalled “concordato in continuità aziendale”) – in which case, the creditors are satisfied (in whole or in
part) with the proceeds from the continuation of the business activity; or (ii) the liquidation of the
company’s assets (so-called “concordato con liquidazione del patrimonio”) – in which case, the
composition plan must necessarily provide for an injection of liquidity, from third parties, that can
increase the available assets by at least 10% and ensure a minimum recovery of at least 20% for
unsecured creditors.

The proposal filed in connection with the petition for composition may provide for: (i) the restructuring
and payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any event, it ensures
the payment of at least 20% of unsecured claims, except in the case of an arrangement as a going concern
(concordato in continuità aziendale)), including through extraordinary transactions, such as the
granting to creditors and their subsidiaries or affiliates of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible
into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities) (ii) the transfer of the assets of the debtor
company submitting the proposal for composition to an assumptor (assuntore); (iii) the division of
creditors into classes (mandatory in certain cases under Article 85 of the Insolvency Code), provided
that each class is composed of creditors having homogeneous legal positions and economic interests;


-----

and (iv) the different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The proposal for composition
may also contain a proposal for a tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

It should be noted that a composition with creditors qualifies as a going concern (in continuità
_aziendale) when the plan envisages the continuation, on a direct or indirect basis, of the business activity_
by the debtor business and the creditors are satisfied – even if not predominantly – through the proceeds
deriving from the continuation of the business activity. Pursuant to Article 84 of the Insolvency Code,
business continuity must safeguard the interests of creditors and, to the maximum extent possible, the
company’s employment levels.

Moreover, some specific rules apply only to composition proceedings with business continuity (in
_continuità aziendale). In particular, inter alia:_

(i) pursuant to Article 84(6) of the Insolvency Code, in an arrangement procedure with business

continuity (in continuità aziendale): (a) the proceeds arising from the liquidation of the company’s
assets are distributed to creditors according to the so-called “absolute priority rule”; (b) the
proceeds arising from the continuation of the business activity (i.e, exceeding the liquidation value)
may be distributed according to the so-called “relative priority rule”, meaning that it is not
mandatory to distribute them according to the ranking of the creditors, but it is sufficient to ensure
that all classes of creditors sharing the same ranking are treated equally and more favourably than
classes of creditors of lower ranking. Notwithstanding the foregoing, secured claims within the
meaning of Article 2751-bis of the Italian Civil Code (i.e. wages) must be satisfied in accordance
with the “absolute priority rule”;

(ii) division into classes is mandatory. Classes must also be created with respect to secured creditors,

unless they are repaid in full by cash within 180 days (reduced to 30 days for employees) after
approval without any waiver of their security interests. So-called “impresere minori” (i.e.
enterprises not subject to judicial liquidation) that are unsecured creditors of the enterprise under
contracts for the supply of goods or services will be placed in different classes;

(iii) subject to the provisions of Article 109 of the Insolvency Code, pursuant to Article 86 of the

Insolvency Code, the composition plan as a going concern (in continuità aziendale) may provide
for a suspension for secured creditors, which may extend up to six months from the date of
approval of the composition proposal for the payment of secured creditors (creditori privilegiati)
pursuant to Article 2751-bis of the Italian Civil Code (e.g. employees, professionals, etc.).

(iv) the composition plan for an arrangement with creditors on a going-concern basis (in continuità

_aziendale) must indicate, inter alia, the financial impact of the plan and the timeframe required to_
achieve the rebalancing of the company’s financial situation. In addition, where the plan envisages
the direct continuation of the business activity, the plan must contain a detailed indication of the
expected costs and revenues, financial requirements and related cash flows, also considering the
costs necessary to ensure compliance with applicable labour and environmental laws;

(v) the expert’s report must certify that the plan is aimed at overcoming or preventing the company’s

insolvency and ensuring its economic sustainability. In addition, the expert’s report must confirm
that the treatment (recovery) of creditors in the arrangement is no worse than the treatment
(recovery) of creditors in a judicial liquidation;

(vi) creditors may not unilaterally refuse to perform their obligations under ongoing agreements, nor

may they terminate or accelerate them or modify them in a manner detrimental to the debtor solely
on the grounds of the debtor’s application for an arrangement as a going concern (in continuità
_aziendale). Any contrary provision shall be ineffective. Notwithstanding the foregoing, creditors_
affected by the protective measures may not unilaterally refuse to perform their obligations arising
from “essential contracts in progress” nor may they terminate or advance their due dates or modify
them in a detrimental manner to the debtor solely on the ground of the debtor’s non-payment of
claims arising prior to the filing of the application for an arrangement as a going concern.


-----

According to the Insolvency Code, essential pending contracts (contratti essenziali in corso di
_esecuzione) if it is necessary for the continuation of ordinary business (in continuità aziendale),_
including supply contracts, the termination of which could prevent the company from continuing
its business.

Pursuant to Article 100 of the Insolvency Code, inter alia, a debtor who files for an arrangement as a
going concern (in continuità aziendale) may request the court to authorise the payment (i) of debts that
arose prior to the filing of the arrangement in connection with the supply of goods or services essential
to the business, provided that an independent expert certifies that they are essential to the continuation
of the business and to ensure the best satisfaction of creditors and (ii) in accordance with the relevant
contractual terms, of the instalments due under a loan agreement secured by a security interest in assets
used in the business, provided that (a) on the filing date, the debtor has fulfilled its obligations under
the agreement, or the court authorises the payment of the debt for principal and interest due on that date
and (b) an independent third-party expert certifies that such payments are essential for the continuation
of the business activity and serve to ensure the best satisfaction of creditors and that the secured claims
can be satisfied in full with the proceeds of the liquidation of the asset, carried out at market value, and
that the repayment of the instalments does not prejudice the rights of other creditors.

As previously mentioned, pursuant to Article 84 of the Insolvency Code, in a composition with creditors
without going-concern (“ con liquidazione del patrimonio”), the composition (concordato) proposal
must provide for a contribution (injection of liquidity) of resources by a third party, capable of
increasing the assets (attivo) available to creditors at the date of filing by at least 10% and ensuring a
minimum recovery of at least 20% for unsecured creditors. Third-party resources subject to the
mandatory contribution may also be distributed to creditors irrespective of their ranking, provided that
the aforementioned 20% minimum recovery is achieved. According to the Insolvency Code,
contributions made by the company’s shareholders without any obligation of repayment by the
company (as well as contributions by shareholders that are fully and expressly subordinated) qualify as
“third-party contributions” for the purposes of Section 84 of the Insolvency Code, if the plan provides
for their direct application for the benefit of the company’s creditors. As a rule, the division into classes
of creditors is not mandatory in the case of an arrangement with creditors without going concern (con
_liquidazione del patrimonio). However, pursuant to Article 85(2) of the Insolvency Code, classes must_
be created in relation to the following creditors: (i) creditors for tax and/or contribution claims that will
not be repaid in full; (ii) creditors benefiting from collateral/guarantees issued by third parties; (iii)
creditors that will be satisfied not in cash (even if the satisfaction is partly in cash and partly by other
means); (iv) creditors that have filed a “competing composition (concordato) proposal” and their related
parties.

At the time of filing, the Court, inter alia, determines whether the proposal of arrangement is admissible
by assessing: (i) in the case of an arrangement without business continuity (con liquidazione del
_patrimonio), the admissibility of the proposal and the feasibility of the plan (in the sense that the plan_
must not be manifestly unsuitable to achieve the envisaged objectives); and (ii) in the case of an
arrangement with business continuity (in continuità aziendale), the compliance of the proposal with the
applicable legal provisions (ritualità). The proposal for an arrangement with business continuity is, in
any event, not admissible if the plan is manifestly unsuitable to satisfy the creditors as proposed by the
debtor and to preserve business values (valori aziendali).

If the court determines that the proposal for composition (proposta di concordato) is admissible, inter
alia, it appoints a delegated judge (Giudice delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints (or confirms,
as the case may be) one or more judicial commissioners (commissari giudiziali) and schedules a specific
period of time during which creditors can express their vote.

During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its
corporate bodies (usually the board of directors), but is supervised by the judicial commissioners and
the appointed judge (who will authorise all operations beyond ordinary administration). Moreover, until


-----

the proceedings are approved, the debtor may not make payments on debts that arose before the opening
of the proceedings, unless they have been specifically approved by the delegated judge.

Under the Insolvency Code: (i) one or more creditors (with the exception of natural or legal persons
controlled, controlling or under common control with the debtor) representing at least 10 per cent. of
the total claims resulting from the debtor’s updated balance sheets filed with the courts and (ii)
shareholders representing at least 10% of the company’s share capital may submit a proposal for
composition (proposta di concordato preventivo) with creditors competing with the debtor’s proposal
(proposta concorrente) – within 30 days prior to the commencement of the voting procedure – provided
that certain conditions are met, including, in particular, that the debtor’s proposal does not provide for
the payment of at least 30% of the unsecured claims (this threshold is reduced to 20% in the event that
the debtor has previously and successfully commenced a negotiated crisis resolution procedure
(composizione negoziata)).

In addition, pursuant to Article 91 of the Insolvency Code, if the composition plan includes an offer for
the sale of the debtor’s assets or for the sale of the debtor’s business to an identified third party, the
court or the delegated judge shall order that adequate publicity is given to such offer in order to acquire
competing offers (offerte concorrenti). If expressions of interest are received, the court or the delegated
judge, by decree, orders the opening of the competitive procedure. Moreover, the aforementioned decree
establishes the procedures for submitting irrevocable bids, providing that in all cases, inter alia, the
following must be ensured (i) their comparability; (ii) the requirements for the bidders to participate; I
the forms and timing of access to the relevant information; (iii) any limits on their use; (iv) the manner
in which the court-appointed liquidator must provide it to those who request it; (v) the manner in which
the competitive procedure has to be conducted; (vi) the minimum increase in the consideration to be
provided by subsequent bidders; (vii) the securities to be provided by the bidders; (viii) the forms of
advertising; and (ix) the date of the hearing for the evaluation of the bids, if the sale takes place before
the court. With the sale or with the assignment, whichever is earlier, to a person other than the original
bidder identified in the plan, the latter and the debtor are released from their mutual obligations and
consequently the debtor will have to amend the proposal and the plan according to the outcome of the
competitive procedure.

Normally, the composition agreement (concordato preventivo) is voted on within the time limit set by
the court and must be approved with the favourable vote of (i) the creditors representing a majority of
the claims allowed to vote and, even if the plan provides for more than one class of creditors, or (ii) a
majority of the claims allowed to vote is reached by a majority of the classes. Pursuant to Section 109(1)
of the Insolvency Code, in the event that a creditor has more than a majority of the claims allowed to
vote, a majority of heads (maggioranza per teste) must also be reached. The composition agreement
(concordato preventivo) is only approved if the required majorities of the creditors have expressly voted
in favour of the proposal. Creditors who have not exercised their right to vote shall be deemed not to
have approved the composition agreement proposal (proposta di concordato).

Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the composition agreement proposal (proposta di
_concordato) for an arrangement unless and to the extent that they waive their guarantee, or the_
arrangement agreement (concordato preventivo) provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of
the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in
which case they may only vote in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. Among
others, (i) companies controlling the debtor, those controlled by the debtor and those under the control
of the entity controlling the debtor, (ii) assignees of the claims of the entities referred to in paragraph
(i) above, if the assignment was completed in the year preceding the arrangement (concordato
_preventivo), and (iii) creditors with conflicting interests are excluded from voting._

In contrast to the general rules set out above, an arrangement as a going-concern (in continuità
_aziendale) is approved with the favourable vote of all classes of creditors. In each class, the arrangement_
is approved by the affirmative vote of creditors representing a majority of the claims allowed to vote
or, if this threshold is not reached, by the affirmative vote of creditors representing two-thirds of the


-----

claims of the voting creditors, provided that creditors holding at least half of the total claims of the same
class have voted. Secured creditors are not eligible to vote if they are repaid in full (and in cash) within
180 days (reduced to 30 days for employees) after approval without any waiver of their security
interests. If these requirements are not met, the secured creditors are entitled to vote. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Insolvency Code provides that an arrangement with creditors as a going concern (in
_continuità aziendale) may be approved by the Court even in the event that all creditors fail to approve_
the arrangement if certain specific conditions are met.

In addition to the above, under certain conditions, the composition plan may provide for the creation of
one or more classes of shareholders (more than one class of shareholders may be created if the
company’s articles of association - also, if applicable, as amended in the course of the composition
procedure - provide for different rights for shareholders). The creation of classes of shareholders is
required by law (i) if the composition plan provides for amendments that directly affect the
shareholders’ rights; and/or (ii) in the case of listed/public companies (società che fanno ricorso al
_mercato del capitale di rischio)._

If one or more classes of shareholders have been provided for, the shareholders are entitled to vote in
the form and on the terms provided for the creditors’ vote. Within the respective class, the relevant
shareholder is entitled to vote in proportion to the share of capital held prior to the filing of the
arrangement (concordato). If a shareholder does not vote within the prescribed time limit, he shall be
deemed to have voted in favour.

If composition proposals (proposte concorrenti) have been filed by one or more creditors, these will
also be submitted to a vote of the creditors. The winning proposal is the one that obtains the highest
majority of positive votes and, in the event of a tie, the debtor’s proposal prevails over that of a creditor,
while the proposal of one creditor prevails over that of another creditor if it was filed first. In the event
that none of the proposals reaches the required number of votes as described above, the judge will again
put the proposal that obtained the highest majority to a vote.

It should be noted that the delegated judge may provisionally admit (in whole or in part) creditors of
disputed claims to the voting session for the sole purpose of voting on the composition proposal
(proposta di concordato) and calculating the relevant majorities. Excluded creditors shall have the right
to object to this decision by filing a specific petition as part of the court’s approval, in any event, only
if their participation in the voting session may have influenced the calculation of the relevant majorities.

After the arrangement agreement has been approved by the creditors, the Court shall set the date of the
hearing for the formal homologation (omologazione) of the arrangement (concordato preventivo), and
the debtor shall notify the interested parties thereof. At least 10 (ten) days prior to the date of the
approval hearing, each dissenting creditor and/or any interested third party may file an objection/appeal
(opposizione) against the proposed approval of the composition agreement. In the absence of objections
(opposizioni), the court shall approve the arrangement (concordato) after verifying (i) the regularity of
the arrangement (concordato) procedure; (ii) the outcome of the creditors’ vote; (iii) the admissibility
of the proposal; (iv) the proper creation of the classes of creditors; and (v) the equal treatment of
creditors within each class. In addition, in the case of an arrangement (concordato) as a going concern,
the court will verify that all classes have voted in favour of the proposal, that the plan has reasonable
prospects of preventing or overcoming insolvency and that any new financing is necessary to implement
the plan and does not unfairly prejudice the interests of creditors. In any other case, the court must verify
the practicability of the plan (i.e. that the plan is not manifestly inadequate to achieve the stated
objectives).

In addition, in the case of an arrangement (concordato) as a going-concern, if one or more classes are
opposed, the court, at the debtor’s request (or, in the case of a concurrent arrangement (concordato)
proposal, with the debtor’s consent) may nevertheless approve the arrangement (concordato) if the
following conditions are jointly fulfilled (i) the liquidation value is allocated on the basis of the rank of
each claim (absolute priority rule); (ii) the resources resulting from the going-concern in excess of the


-----

liquidation value are distributed in such a way that the claims included in the dissenting classes receive
an overall treatment at least equal to that of the classes of equal rank and more favourable than that of
the classes of lower rank (relative priority rule) (iii) no single creditor is paid more than the amount of
its claim; and (iv) the proposal is approved by a majority of the classes, provided that at least one of the
classes is composed of secured creditors or, in the absence thereof, the proposal is approved by at least
one class of creditors that would be at least partially settled on the basis of their respective ranking of
claims also for the value in excess of the liquidation value.

In addition, pursuant to Article 88 of the Insolvency Code, if the debtor has submitted a “tax settlement”
proposal to the Tax Administration/Social Security Authority under the Insolvency Code, the court may
approve the arrangement even without the consent of such creditors when their consent is necessary to
obtain the applicable majorities, on condition that the expert’s report certifies that the proposal made
by the debtor to such creditor is more advantageous than a liquidation scenario.

In the event of a challenge to the homologation, the Court will decide on each of the objections. If the
Court rejects all challenges and has no further observations, it will issue the probate decree.

Article 112 of the Insolvency Code provides for a “cram-down” mechanism whereby:

(i) in the case of an arrangement with business continuity (in continuità aziendale), if a creditor
disputes the “convenience” of the arrangement (concordato) proposal, the court may approve
the arrangement (concordato) only if it considers that the relevant claim will be satisfied for
an amount not lower than that which would be paid under a judicial liquidation;

(ii) in all other cases, the court may approve an arrangement (concordato) which is challenged by
(a) a creditor belonging to a “dissenting class” of creditors; or (b) where there is no class of
creditors, by creditors representing 20% of the claims admitted to vote, to the extent that (c)
such challenges relate to the “appropriateness” of the arrangement (concordato) proposal and
(d) the court considers that the relevant claim will be satisfied for an amount not less than that
which would be paid in a court-supervised liquidation.

Moreover, if the plan provides for the pre-existing shareholders to benefit from the so-called
“restructuring value”, the arrangement may be approved if one or more classes of creditors are
dissenting, to the extent that the recoupment of each dissenting class is at least as good as the
recoupment of other classes of equal ranking and more favourable than the proposed recoupment of the
lower ranking classes, even if the restructuring value reserved for shareholders were to be applied to
those classes. According to the Insolvency Code, “restructuring value reserved for shareholders”
means the actual value of the shareholders’ interests in the company following the approval of the
proposal, without any contributions made by the shareholders for the purposes of the restructuring.
Shareholders may challenge the approval if it is prejudicial to them against a liquidation scenario.

If the arrangement provides for the liquidation of the debtor’s assets, the court, if it approves the
arrangement, shall appoint one or more liquidators to implement the approved plan if it is to be
implemented by the transfer of assets. The court may confer special powers on the liquidator to
implement the plan if the debtor does not collaborate, including by taking all necessary corporate
actions.

If the court does not approve the arrangement, it may open the judicial liquidation of the company only
if there are pending petitions to that effect.

The terms and performance of existing contracts entered into from time to time by the debtor are not
automatically affected by the arrangement procedure and normally continue pending the procedure, any
agreements to the contrary being ineffective. However, pursuant to Article 97 of the Insolvency Code,
the debtor may request the Court to terminate or suspend the effectiveness of such pending agreements
(subject to certain exceptions: e.g., employment contracts cannot be suspended or terminated) if the


-----

continuation of the agreement is neither in line with the plan nor functional to its implementation. It
should be noted that termination can only be requested only if the composition plan and proposal have
already been filed with the court. In such cases, the other party will be eligible for compensation equal
to the damages suffered as a result of the termination or suspension of the agreement. Such indemnity
shall be treated as an unsecured claim arising prior to the composition proceedings, without prejudice,
however, to the super-senior status of those claims arising as a result of settlements legally effected
after the publication of the composition petition in the Commercial Register (and prior to the notification
of the suspension/termination petition).

Specific rules are provided in relation to the termination of leasing contracts and ongoing loan
agreements. In this last regard, para. 14 of Article 97 of the Insolvency Code provides that, in the event
of the termination of a financing agreement, the lender has the right to collect and retain the sums paid
by the company’s debtors until full repayment of the advances made by the lender to the company
during the period between (i) the date falling 120 days prior to the filing of the composition agreement
and (ii) the date on which the lender is notified of the termination petition.

In addition to the above, Article 95 of the Insolvency Code explains that outstanding contracts with the
Italian public administration are not terminated following the filing of the composition agreement and
any provision to the contrary is ineffective; such contracts continue to be effective if the independent
third-party expert certifies that such contracts are coherent with the plan (if already drawn up) and that
the company is reasonable able to fulfil them. In the case of a composition with creditors as a going
concern (in continuità aziendale), the expert must also certify that the continuance of such contracts is
necessary to obtain the best possible liquidation of the going concern (migliore liquidazione
_dell’azienda in esercizio). After the filing of the composition agreement, the company may participate_
in public bidding subject to the Court’s authorization and subject to the fulfilment of certain
requirements of the Insolvency Code (including the filing of a third-party expert’s report in this regard).

Pursuant to Article 89 of the Insolvency Code, the rules regulating the loss and reduction of share capital
provided for by the Italian Civil Code do not apply to Italian companies during the period from the date
of filing of the application for composition to the date of its approval.

Moreover, during this period, the rule providing for the dissolution of the company in the event of a
reduction or loss of share capital does not apply. However, during the period preceding the filing of the
application for the arrangement, Article 2486 of the Italian Civil Code, which provides for the powers
and duties of the directors after the occurrence of an event of dissolution of the company, will apply.

For an analysis of the rules governing new financial resources, please refer to the specific section under
section “New Financial Resources.”

Pursuant to Articles 119 and 120 of the Insolvency Code, in the event of a breach of the composition
plan or fraud, upon the fulfilment of the requirements, the composition agreement may be terminated
or annulled, as the case may be, upon the request of one or more creditors; judicial liquidation may
follow. The composition agreement is binding on all creditors prior to the publication of the application
in the commercial register. However, creditors retain their rights vis-à-vis the debtor’s co-debtors and
guarantors.

In the event of minor violations, the arrangement may be terminated by any of the creditors or by the
judicial commissioner (in the event of an application by one or more creditors).

The relevant action must be filed within one year from the original term of the last business to be
conducted under the arrangement. The composition agreement may also be terminated upon application
of the court-appointed liquidator or one or more creditors if part of the debtor’s assets have been
concealed or liabilities have been maliciously exaggerated.


-----

The relevant lawsuit must be filed within six months from the discovery of the
concealment/exaggeration and, in any event, within two years from the original deadline for the last
activity to be carried out under the arrangement.

Finally, it should be noted that Articles 284 et seq. of the Insolvency Code provide for a group
arrangement. More precisely, if several companies (having the center of their main interests in Italy)
belonging to the same group find themselves in a situation of crisis or insolvency, they may file a single
request for composition with creditors, comprising a single composition plan or several linked plans.
The assets and liabilities of each group company will be evaluated on an individual basis. In such a
case, the legal framework of the group arrangement is the same as that applicable to the ordinary type,
subject to certain specific rules/exceptions, including, inter alia: (i) the arrangement petition must
specify the reasons why a group procedure is more convenient for creditors than individual and separate
proceedings; (ii) the arrangement petition and plan(s) must include certain additional information,
mainly related to the group structure, intercompany relations, etc.; (iii) the plan(s) must ensure the
restructuring of each group company and must be certified by the third party expert. The expert’s report
must also confirm that the group proceedings are more advantageous for creditors than separate
proceedings; (iv) the plan or plans may provide for both the continuation of some business activities
and the liquidation of others. The procedure qualifies as a going-concern arrangement (concordato in
_continuità aziendale) when the proceeds from the continuation of the business exceed those from the_
liquidation of the assets; and (v) certain specific rules apply in relation to the voting stage and the
approval stage of the procedure.

**_Negotiated crisis composition procedure (composizione negoziata per la crisi di impresa) under the_**
**_Insolvency Code_**

The negotiated settlement procedure for business crises (composizione negoziata per la crisi di impresa)
was originally introduced into the Italian legal framework by Decree 118/2021 and subsequently
incorporated into the Insolvency Code. It is a negotiated and out-of-court instrument applicable to both
commercial (imprenditori commerciali) and agricultural enterprises (imprenditori agricoli), which find
themselves in a situation of difficulty with reference to their assets, their business and/or their financial
situation, such as to make a situation of distress/crisis or insolvency likely to occur. It is therefore an
instrument aimed at anticipating the further deterioration of the debtor’s situation.

Notwithstanding the above, the court may become involved in the following two circumstances: (i)
when the entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 18 of the Insolvency Code requesting the
competent court to confirm or modify the protective measures provided for in the same provision on
the same day as the publication of the petition in the commercial register and the acceptance of the
expert and, if necessary, to take the provisional measures necessary to complete the negotiations; and
(ii) when the entrepreneur files a petition requesting the court to authorise certain acts in line with the
provisions of Article 22 of the Insolvency Code.

Pursuant to Article 17 of the Insolvency Code, the entrepreneur or undertaking filing an application for
an arrangement with creditors (composizione negoziata per la crisi di impresa) shall, inter alia, certify
that no judicial winding-up proceedings or similar proceedings are pending against it, nor applications
for admission to proceedings under Articles 40 of the Insolvency Code, including pursuant to Articles
44(1)(a) and 54 of the Insolvency Code. 1(a) and 54(3) were previously filed. If an application for a
negotiated settlement of an enterprise’s crisis (composizione negoziata per la crisi di impresa) is
dismissed (archiviata), the entrepreneur may not file a new application until one year has elapsed since
the dismissal (the time limit is reduced, on a one-time basis, to four months if dismissal is requested by
the entrepreneur within two months of the expert’s acceptance).

The negotiated settlement procedure for business crises (composizione negoziata per la crisi di impresa)
is initiated on a voluntary basis only by filing an application for the appointment of a third and
independent expert with the Secretary General of the relevant Chamber of Commerce through a special
electronic platform, and the expert is appointed within five days of filing the application. Pursuant to


-----

the Insolvency Code, the person to be appointed as an expert must not have or maintain professional
relations with the business owner during the two years following the closure of the negotiated settlement
procedure for the business crisis (composizione negoziata per la crisi di impresa). The application may
not be filed during the pendency of a procedure for the restructuring of overindebtedness or liquidation
of assets pursuant to Articles 7 and 14-ter of Law No. 3/2012 (procedimenti di composizione della crisi
_da sovranindebitamento e di liquidazione del patrimonio). The expert’s role is to facilitate and manage_
negotiations between the company, creditors and other stakeholders in order to find a solution to
overcome the crisis or insolvency, including through the sale of the company or a branch thereof.

The expert evaluates his or her independence, the adequacy of his or her professional skills, and his or
her time availability with respect to the proposed assignment and, if the outcome of the evaluation is
positive, communicates his or her acceptance to the entrepreneur and uploads it onto the dedicated
electronic platform. If the expert accepts the assignment, he meets with the entrepreneur to assess
whether there are real and concrete possibilities for recovery. The entrepreneur attends the meeting in
person and may be assisted by his advisors.

If the expert considers that there are concrete and real possibilities for recovery, he meets the parties
involved in the recovery process of the business owner and presents possible strategies, planning
periodic close meetings.

During the negotiations, all parties involved must act in good faith and with fairness, must collaborate
and are required to maintain confidentiality about the situation of the business owner, the actions
performed or planned by the business owner and the information received during the negotiations. The
business owner must provide a complete and clear representation of its situation and manage its assets
without causing unfair prejudice to creditors. Banks and financial intermediaries, their agents and, in
the case of assignment and/or transfer of credit, their assignees or assignors, must participate in the
negotiation in an informed and active manner. Access to the arrangement procedure (composizione
_negoziata per la crisi di impresa) is not, in itself, a reason to revoke the credit facility. Specific rules_
apply to negotiations regarding employment contracts.

If the expert, after the meeting with the entrepreneur or afterwards, finds that there is no real possibility
of reorganisation, he must promptly notify the entrepreneur and the Secretary General of the Chamber
of Commerce, who will file the entrepreneur’s petition. The negotiated business crisis settlement
procedure (composizione negoziata per la crisi di impresa) may not exceed 180 days, without prejudice
to a possible extension of a further 180 days in the presence of certain requirements. In particular, the
expert’s appointment is considered terminated if, after 180 days from the appointment, the parties have
not agreed on a solution (which may also be proposed by the expert) to overcome the entrepreneur’s
crisis situation. However, the engagement of the expert may continue for up to a further 180 days if (i)
all parties involved in the negotiations so request and the expert agrees, or (ii) the continuation of the
engagement is required by the fact that the entrepreneur has filed a petition with the court pursuant to
Article 19 and/or Article 22 of the Insolvency Code.

Upon completion of the assignment, the expert issues a final report, which is uploaded onto the platform,
and notifies the entrepreneur and the court that granted the precautionary measures and provisional
measures (if any) declaring the termination of their effects.

Under Article 18 of the Insolvency Code, along with the petition for appointment of the expert, or with
a subsequent petition, the business owner may apply for protective measures, which may also be limited,
at the business owner’s request, to certain claims or a specific category of creditors. If protective
measures are awarded, as from the date of publication of the relevant application, pre-existing creditors
cannot obtain pre-emption rights (diritti di prelazione) unless they have been agreed with the
entrepreneur, and all enforcement and provisional actions are suspended. However, it should be noted
that, differently from what it is provided under the Insolvency Code for composition proceedings
(concordato preventivo), payment of pre-existing creditors is not prohibited. The protective measures
do not apply to employees’ claims.


-----

From the date of the publication of the petition for the application of protective measures until the date
of the conclusion of negotiations or rejection of the petition for the arrangement procedure
(composizione negoziata per la crisi di impresa) the judgment opening judicial liquidation (sentenza di
_apertura della liquidazione giudiziale) or the declaration of the entrepreneur’s insolvency may not be_
declared by the court, unless the court revokes the protective measures.

Creditors whose rights are covered by the protective measures may not unilaterally reject fulfilment of
obligations arising from existing contracts with the entrepreneur, nor terminate such contracts, nor
anticipate their expiration, nor modify them with prejudicial consequences for the businessperson,
merely because of non-payment of claims that arose prior to the publication of the petition requesting
the application of the protective measures. However, creditors may stay the performance of ongoing
contracts from the publication of the request for precautionary measures until such measures are
obtained.

If the entrepreneur requests precautionary measures, it must simultaneously file the same request with
the competent court to allow a judge to verify these measures and confirm or, if necessary, modify them.
In the absence of such a request, the precautionary measures will be ineffective.

The length of the precautionary measures and, if necessary, the provisional measures, is set by order of
the court in a range between 30 and 120 days and, at the request of the parties and after obtaining the
expert’s opinion, may be extended for the time necessary to successfully conclude the negotiations up
to a maximum of 240 days, it being noted that the judge may discretionally order the revocation of such
precautionary measures or reduce their length.

Pending the negotiated settlement procedure for the business crisis (composizione negoziata per la crisi
_di impresa), there is no dispossession: the entrepreneur remains able to continue the ordinary and_
extraordinary management of the business, subject to certain conditions. More specifically, pursuant to
Article 21 of the Insolvency Code, pending the negotiated settlement procedure, the businessman may
perform acts pertaining to ordinary business. Subject to written notice to the expert, perform acts of
extraordinary activity or make payments that are inconsistent with the negotiations or the prospects of
recovery, so as not to endanger the economic and financial viability of the company. In particular, acts,
payments and guarantees/real interests made by the business owner after the appointment of the expert
within the scope of the negotiated settlement procedure for the business crisis are not subject to the
claw-back action pursuant to Article 166(2) of the Insolvency Code, if they are coherent with the state
of negotiations and the prospects for the company’s recovery. If it appears during the course of
negotiations that the businessperson is insolvent but that there are real recovery prospects, the
businessperson shall run the business in the best interest of the creditors, without prejudice to its
liability. If the expert is of the opinion that a particular act is prejudicial to the creditors, negotiations,
or prospects for recovery, he/she shall notify the business owner and the company’s supervisory body
in writing. If, despite the expert’s report, the entrepreneur performs the act in question, the entrepreneur
immediately notifies the expert, who may file his/her dissent for registration in the commercial register.
At the request of the entrepreneur, one or more creditors or the expert, the court that granted the
protective measures and/or interim measures may, at any time, withdraw such measures or reduce their
duration when they do not fulfil the objective of guaranteeing the successful outcome of the negotiations
or appear disproportionate in relation to the prejudice caused to the creditors. If the protective measures
are withdrawn, the rule concerning the prevention of obtaining pre-emption rights from pre-existing
creditors shall expire on the date the protective measure is withdrawn.

At the request of the entrepreneur and to the extent compatible with the continuity of the business and
the maximisation of the creditors’ recovery, the court may authorise: (i) the entrepreneur or one or more
companies belonging to the same group to incur new super-senior (prededucibile) indebtedness
pursuant to Article 6 of the Insolvency Code; (ii) the entrepreneur to contract a new super-senior
(prededucibile) debt by virtue of a shareholder loan pursuant to Article 6 of the Insolvency Code; and
(iii) the entrepreneur to transfer its business, or some branches thereof, without the effects provided for
in Article 2560(2) of the Italian Civil Code, without prejudice to Article 2112 of the Italian Civil Code,


-----

identifying appropriate measures to protect all the interests involved, also taking into account the
requests of the parties concerned. The court shall also verify the respect of the principle of
competitiveness (principio di competitività) in the selection of the purchaser.

According to Article 23 of the Insolvency Code, if a suitable solution has been found to resolve the
entrepreneur’s problems, the business crisis negotiated settlement procedure (composizione negoziata
_per la crisi di impresa) may end with_

(i) the execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors, which

constitutes grounds for the application of the bonus measures provided for in Article 25-bis (1) of
the Insolvency Code if, according to the final report of the expert, such agreement ensures the
continuity of the business for at least 2 years;

(ii) the conclusion of a moratorium agreement (convenzione di moratoria) pursuant to Article 62 of

the Insolvency Code;

(iii) the conclusion of an agreement signed by the entrepreneur, the creditors and the expert, with the

effects provided for in articles 166 (3) (d) and 324 of the Insolvency Code. In this agreement, the
expert notes that the restructuring plan (piano di risanamento) appears to be consistent with the
resolution of the entrepreneur’s insolvency and crisis.

If, at the end of the negotiations, none of the above solutions have been chosen, the entrepreneur may,
alternative

(i) draw up a certified reorganisation plan (piano attestato di risanamento) pursuant to Article 56 of

the Insolvency Code;

(ii) file an application for approval of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di

_ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Articles 57, 60 and 61 of the Insolvency Code. The_
percentage referred to in Article 61 (2) (c) of the Insolvency Code is reduced to 60 per cent. if the
achievement of the agreement is reflected in the final report of the expert;

(iii) filing an application for a simplified composition agreement for the liquidation of assets

(concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio) (see “Simplified Composition
_Agreement for the Liquidation of Assets” below)_

(iv) accessing one of the proceedings/instruments provided for by the Insolvency Code or Decree No.

270 or Decree No. 347.

In addition, pursuant to Article 24 of the Insolvency Code:

(i) the acts authorized by the court pursuant to Article 22 of the Insolvency Code shall retain their

effects in the event of the subsequent occurrence of an approved debt restructuring agreement
(accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti omologato), an approved arrangement procedure, an
approved restructuring plan pursuant to Article 64-bis of the Insolvency Code (piano di
_ristrutturazione omologato), the opening of judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale),_
compulsory administrative liquidation (liquidazione coatta amministrativa), extraordinary
administration (amministrazione straordinaria) or simplified arrangement for the liquidation of
assets (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio);

(ii) transactions, payments and granting of collateral made by the entrepreneur after the expert’s

acceptance of the assignment are exempt from recovery actions pursuant to Section 166(2) of the
Insolvency Code, if they are consistent with the course and state of negotiations and the prospects
of recovery existing at the time the transaction/payment/grant of collateral was made;

(iii) extraordinary operations and payments made after the expert’s acceptation of the engagement are

in any event subject to actions for claw-back pursuant to Articles 165 and 166 of the Insolvency


-----

Code if the expert has registered his/her dissent in the commercial register pursuant to Article
21(4) of the Insolvency Code or if the competent court has denied its authorization pursuant to
Section 22 of the Insolvency Code.

Moreover, payments and settlements made after the expert’s appointment acceptance, which the expert
considers consistent with the development of the negotiations and the prospects for the company’s
recovery, or which have been authorised by the court pursuant to Article 22 of the Insolvency Code,
benefit from exemptions from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions.

Pursuant to Article 25 of the Insolvency Code, the negotiated settlement procedure for corporate crisis
(composizione negoziata per la crisi d’impresa) can also be applied to groups of companies, which can
all start a single procedure together. At the end of the negotiations, the companies belonging to the same
group may enter into one of the agreements provided for in Article 23(1) of the Insolvency Code. 1 of
the Insolvency Code as a group, or access one of the instruments provided for in Article 23 of the
Insolvency Code, either separately or as a whole group.

**_Simplified composition with creditors proceeding for the liquidation of assets (concordato_**
**_semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio) under the Insolvency Code_**

The simplified arrangement for the liquidation of assets (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione
_del patrimonio) is a special type of arrangement procedure (concordato preventivo) available only to_
those companies that (i) have first entered into the arrangement procedure (composizione negoziata per
_la crisi d’impresa); and (ii) as certified by the expert within the framework of the arrangement procedure_
(composizione negoziata per la crisi d’impresa), despite the fact that negotiations in good faith with the
creditors could not reach a positive outcome.

The simplified composition agreement for the liquidation of assets (concordato semplificato per la
_liquidazione del patrimonio) - which has a purely liquidation purpose - was originally introduced into_
Italian law by Decree 118/2021 and was subsequently incorporated into the Insolvency Code.

If, in his final relation, the expert asserts that the negotiations were unsuccessful, but were conducted
fairly and in good faith, and that the options provided for in Article 23(1) and (2)(b) of the Insolvency
Code are not practicable, within 60 days of the notification of the final report, the businessperson may
file, with the relevant court of the place where the company has its registered office, an application for
admission to the simplified composition procedure for the liquidation of assets (concordato semplificato
_per la liquidazione del patrimonio), a proposal for composition with creditors envisaging the liquidation_
of the assets together with the liquidation plan and the documents provided for in Article 39 of the
Insolvency Code. The proposal may provide for the division of creditors into different classes.

The application for a simplified arrangement to liquidate the assets (concordato semplificato per la
_liquidazione del patrimonio) shall be communicated to the public prosecutor and published in the_
commercial register no later than the day following the date of filing with the court. From the date of
such publication, the effects provided for in Articles 6, 46, 94 and 96 of the Insolvency Code shall take
effect.

Upon the time the petition is filed, the court (i) appoints a so-called 'auxiliary’ (ausiliario) to, inter alia,
express an advice on the entrepreneur’s proposal; (ii) orders that the proposal, together with the
auxiliary’s advice and the expert’s final statement, be delivered by the debtor to the creditors appearing
on the list filed by the debtor; and (iii) sets the date of the probate hearing. Creditors and third parties
having an interest have the right to object to the approval within ten days prior to the date set for the
hearing.

The court approves the simplified composition agreement for the liquidation of the assets (concordato
_semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio) when it ascertains (i) the regularity of the adversarial_
process between the parties (contraddittorio) and of the proceedings; (ii) the observance of pre-emption


-----

rights (cause di prelazione); (iii) the practicability of the liquidation plan, and finds that the proposal
does not cause any prejudice to the creditors with respect to what they would receive in the event of the
judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) of the entrepreneur, and in any event ensures a certain
recovery for each creditor. In the approval decree, the court also appoints a liquidator.

The parties may appeal against the homologation decree within 30 days of its notification.

Pursuant to Article 25-septies of the Insolvency Code, the liquidation planning may also provide for the
offer of a third party previously identified to transfer the company or one or more branches of the
company or specific assets to such third party, even before the homologation: in this case, the judicial
liquidator, after verifying the absence of better solutions on the market, may execute the offer.

**_Certified restructuring plans (piani attestati di risanamento) under article 56 of the Insolvency Code_**

The certified restructuring plans _(piani attestati di risanamento) referred to in Article 56 of the_
Insolvency Code are out-of-court instruments that consist of a restructuring plan addressed to creditors
and prepared by debtors in a state of insolvency or crisis, in order to allow the restructuring of
indebtedness and support the rebalancing of the debtor’s financial condition, which must be certified
by an independent third-party expert directly appointed by the debtor and registered with the register of
auditors and accounting experts (Registro dei Revisori Contabili). The independent expert - who must
verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the company data provided by the
company - must possess certain specific requirements and professional qualifications and meet the
requirements of Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in the event of
false declarations or attestations.

Attested restructuring plans (piani attestati di risanamento) are usually implemented through one or
more agreements entered into by the company with the creditors/parties concerned. Such agreements
are merely private agreements and do not affect the right of creditors who are not party to the agreement
to enforce their claims, guarantees or securities. As such, there is no ‘automatic stay’ by law.

Attested restructuring plans (piani attestati di risanamento) and related debt restructuring agreements
are not subject to any form of judicial review or approval and, therefore, no application to the court or
supervisory authority is required. Furthermore, the approval or consent of a specific majority of all
outstanding claims is not required.

The terms and conditions of these plans are liberally negotiable, provided that they are aimed at
restructuring the debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its asset structure. According to Article 56 of
the Insolvency Code, the ‘minimum content’ of the plan must include, inter alia, an indication of nonsubscribing creditors, the financial resources required to pay their claims on the relevant due dates, and
the causes of the crisis. Moreover, it must be supported by adequate documentation representing the
debtor’s financial and commercial situation.

As explicitly set forth in Article 166(3)(d) of the Insolvency Code, in the event of the bankruptcy of
such plans and the declaration of the debtor’s insolvency, the payments and/or acts performed, and/or
security rights granted over the debtor’s assets for the implementation of the restructuring plan, subject
to certain conditions, are not subject to any claw-back action (azione revocatoria), including the
ordinary claw-back action (azione revocatoria) provided for in Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code.
In addition, they are also exempted from the possible application of certain criminal sanctions. Court
approval is not provided for publication in the commercial register of the plan, the independent expert’s
report and the agreement(s) is not mandatory, but is possible at the debtor’s request and allows for
certain tax benefits.

The Insolvency Law provides specific rules on protection against claw-back actions and potential civil
and criminal liabilities in relation to transactions, payments and guarantees granted on the debtor’s


-----

assets made in the context of the implementation of certified reorganization plans (piani attestati di
_risanamento) pursuant to Article 56 of the Insolvency Code._

**_Debt-restructuring agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) under article 57 of the_**
**_Insolvency Code._**

The insolvent debtor or debtor in a state of crisis may enter into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo
_di ristrutturazione dei debiti) with creditors holding at least 60 % of the outstanding indebtedness,_
pursuant to Article 57 et seq. of the Insolvency Code, which must be certified by an independent expert
appointed by the debtor based on an assessment of the veracity of the business and accounting data
provided by the company and the declaration of feasibility and application for approval by the
competent court.

In particular, the independent expert must certify that the plan and the debt restructuring agreement
_(accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) ensure that the indebtedness towards non-participating creditors_
can be fully satisfied within the following 120 days from (i) the date of the court’s approval of the debt
restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti), in the case of debts that are due and
payable to non-parties creditors on the date of approval; and (ii) the due date of the relevant debts, in
the case of debts that are not yet due and payable to non-parties creditors on the date of the court’s
approval of the debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti).

The debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) is published in the commercial
register and becomes effective on the day of its publication. Creditors and other interested parties may
challenge the debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) within 30 days of its
publication in the commercial register. After deciding on any opposition filed, the court approves the
debt restructuring agreement by a decree, which may be appealed within 30 days of its publication
pursuant to Article 51 of the Insolvency Code.

The Insolvency Code does not expressly set out any guidelines on the content of the debt restructuring
agreement _(accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti). Thus, the plan may provide for, inter alia, the_
operation of the business by the debtor or a third party, or the sale of the business, and may contain
agreements on refinancing, moratoria, write-offs and/or deferral of claims. The debt restructuring
agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) may also contain a proposal for a tax settlement for
the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

Pursuant to Article 58(1) of the Insolvency Code, in the event of substantive changes to the plan prior
to approval, the expert’s report and the creditors’ consent to the debt restructuring agreement (accordo
_di ristrutturazione dei debiti)_ must be renewed. The report must also be updated in the case of
substantial amendments. In the event of material changes after the approval, the debtor shall make such
changes as are appropriate to guarantee the performance of the agreements by applying for an update
of the sworn report issued by the expert meeting the requirements set forth in Article 57(4) of the
Insolvency Code. In such case, the updated appraisal report, together with the amended restructuring
plan, shall be published in the commercial register and creditors shall be notified accordingly by
registered letter or by certified mail. The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the
aforementioned decree within 30 days of its notification.

With the application for approval of the debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei
_debiti) by the relevant court (or at any time during the proceedings), the debtor may apply for the grant_
of any precautionary measures (aimed at providing for the suspension of actions or the provision by
creditors of collateral security, unless agreed in the debt restructuring agreement in relation to preexisting debts, etc.). Such remedies may also be requested (i) pursuant to Section 54(3) of the Insolvency
Code, to the court by the debtor pending negotiations with the creditors (i.e. prior to the filing of the
petition for approval of the debt restructuring agreement _(accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti)),_
subject to certain conditions, or (ii) pursuant to Article 44 of the Insolvency Code, together with a
‘simplified application’ for access to one of the restructuring instruments provided for in the Insolvency


-----

Code. Pursuant to Article 54(2) of the Insolvency Code, as long as the petition for approval of the debt
restructuring agreement _(accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) contains the related request for_
measures, from the date of publication of the petition in the commercial register it is prohibited to
commence or continue enforcement and conservatory actions (or, in any event, to undertake initiatives
prohibited by the related measures).

This is a court-supervised procedure that does not provide for the divestment of the debtor; nevertheless,
the court may appoint a judicial commissioner to supervise the procedure and must do so if applications
for the opening of judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) are pending, when it is necessary for the
protection of the parties that have filed such applications. Creditors who join the debt restructuring
agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) are not required to be treated in the same way (i.e.
they are free to reject the proposal and protect their interests in other ways) and no cram-down applies
to third party creditors who do not participate, who will be reimbursed in full within the abovementioned time limits.

The court, after verifying the completeness of the documents filed by the debtor, sets the date of the
hearing, which will be held no earlier than 15 days from the notification of the filing. While awaiting
that time limit, creditors and other interested parties may file an objection to the approval. At that
hearing, the court shall rule on any such opposition and assess whether the conditions for approval are
met.

Notwithstanding the above, Articles 60, 61 and 62 of the Insolvency Code set forth the following
additional forms of debt restructuring agreements (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti).

Therefore, Article 60 of the Insolvency Code provides for the so-called facilitated debt restructuring
agreement (accordi di ristrutturazione agevolati). This is a special type of debt restructuring agreement
that may be entered into with creditors representing as little as 30% of the total indebtedness (instead
of the 60% generally required by Article 57(1) of the Insolvency Code) provided that the debtor: (i)
does not propose to suspend the payment of non-participating creditors; and (ii) has not previously
requested (and waives requesting) the court to grant precautionary measures on its assets.

Pursuant to Article 61 of the Insolvency Code, debtors have the option to enter into a debt restructuring
agreement by obtaining the approval of creditors representing at least 75 per cent. of the claims
belonging to the same category (in relation to the homogeneity of their status and economic interests)
and may request the court to declare such agreement binding on non-participating creditors belonging
to the same category (so-called “cram down”).

More specifically, the debt restructuring agreements with extended effects (accordi di ristrutturazione
_ad efficacia estesa) referred to in Article 61 of the Insolvency Code - which were previously only_
permitted in relation to debts owed to banks and financial intermediaries when such debts represented
at least 50 per cent. of the total indebtedness - may now be applied to any category of creditors, provided
that, inter alia: (i) all creditors belonging to the same category have been informed of the
commencement of negotiations, have been able to participate in good faith and have received complete
and up-to-date information on the debtor’s assets, economic and financial situation, as well as the
restructuring agreement and its effects; (ii) the agreement provides for the continuation of business
activities directly or indirectly within the meaning of Article 84 of the Insolvency Code (iii) the claims
of consenting creditors belonging to the same category represent at least 75% of all claims belonging
to the same category (iv) non-member creditors belonging to the same category to which the effects of
the agreement are extended may be satisfied under the agreement in an amount not less than the amount
they would receive in a court-supervised liquidation, it being understood that a creditor may have claims
in more than one category; and (v) the debtor has notified the agreement, the court’s request for approval
and the documents attached thereto to the creditors to be set aside. The 75 per cent. figure drops to 60
per cent. if the debt restructuring agreement is referred to in the final report issued by the expert at the
end of the negotiations of the negotiated settlement procedure (composizione negoziata per la soluzione
_della crisi d’impresa)._


-----

In addition, paragraph 5 of Article 61 of the Insolvency Code provides for the negotiated settlement
procedure to resolve company’s crisis. In such case, if the debtor has financial indebtedness amounting
to at least 50% of its total indebtedness, the debt restructuring agreement may identify one or more
categories of creditors that are banks and financial intermediaries that have a homogenous legal position
and economic interests and extend the effects of the agreement to non-member creditors that are part of
the same category. In this case, the agreement is valid even if it does not provide for the direct or indirect
continuation of the business activity. However, the rights of creditors that are not banks or financial
intermediaries remain valid.

Pursuant to Article 62 of the Insolvency Code, a moratorium agreement (convenzione di moratoria)
entered into between a debtor and its creditors representing 75 per cent. of the same class is also binding
on non-participating creditors, provided that (i) certain conditions are met, such as, inter alia, (a) all
creditors belonging to the relevant class have been duly notified of the commencement of negotiations,
have been enabled to participate and have received complete and up-to-date information on the debtor’s
assets, economic and financial situation and the agreement and its effects (b) the claims of the
participating creditors of the same class represent 75 per cent. of all creditors of the same class and (c)
there is a real prospect that non-subscribing creditors of the same class, to whom the effects of the
agreement are extended, can be satisfied on the outcome of the agreement to an extent not less than the
judicial liquidation; and (ii) an independent expert certifies (i) the veracity of the business data; (ii) the
ability of the standstill agreement to temporarily settle the effects of the crisis; and (iii) the fulfilment
of the condition in (i)(c) above (i.e., the fact that the reserved treatment was granted to non-participating
creditors of the same class, to whom the effects of the agreement are extended). (i.e. the fact that the
treatment accorded to the non-parties is at least equal to that which they could obtain in the context of
a judicial liquidation).

Non-affiliating creditors may challenge the standstill agreement within 30 days of its notification.

Under no circumstances may the debt restructuring agreements provided for in Article 61 of the
Insolvency Code and the standstill agreements provided for in Article 62 of the Insolvency Code require
non-parties to, inter alia, fulfil new obligations, grant new credit exposures, maintain the possibility of
utilising existing credit exposures or utilise new credit exposures.

Pursuant to Article 59 of the Insolvency Code, Article 1239 of the Italian Civil Code applies to creditors
who have adhered to debt restructuring agreements. Creditors who have not adhered to the agreements
retain their claims against (i) those who are jointly and severally liable with the debtor, (ii) the debtor’s
guarantors, and (iii) the debtors in recourse (regresso). Unless otherwise agreed, debt restructuring
agreements are effective vis-à-vis those shareholders who are jointly and severally liable with the nonlimited liability company, it being understood that, if such shareholders have granted guarantees, they
will remain liable as guarantors.

For an analysis of the rules set forth in Article 99 of the Insolvency Code – which applies to both debt
restructuring agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) and composition proceedings
(concordati preventivi) – governing supersenior loans authorised prior to the approval of a debt
restructuring agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) and composition proceedings
(concordati preventivi), please refer to the specific section under “New Financial Resources.”

**_Restructuring plans subject to homologation (piani di ristrutturazione soggetti ad omologazione)_**
**_under article 64-bis of the Insolvency Code_**

Restructuring plans subject to homologation (piani di ristrutturazione soggetti ad omologazione) under
Articles 64-bis and 64-ter of the Insolvency Code constitute a new addition to the legal framework of
crisis and insolvency. By virtue of this new instrument, available to insolvent debtors or debtors in a
state of crisis, it is possible to depart from the distribution rules of ordinary insolvency proceedings,
provided that certain strict requirements are met.


-----

More specifically, under this instrument, according to which creditors must be divided into classes
according to homogeneous legal positions and economic interests, the debtor may allocate to creditors
the value generated by the plan even in derogation of the provisions regulating the legal rank/order of
claims (principle of 'par condicio creditorum’), provided that the proposal is approved with the classes’
unanimous consent.

Restructuring plans subject to approval (piani di ristrutturazione soggetti ad omologazione) must
provide for the payment in full, in cash, of the claims secured by the privilege pursuant to Article 2751bis no. 1 of the Italian Civil Code (i.e., wages) within 30 days of the approval and must be certified, as
to the authenticity of the company data and the feasibility of the plan, by an independent professional
satisfying the requirements of the Insolvency Code.

The debtor must file restructuring plans subject to homologation (piani di ristrutturazione soggetti ad
_omologazione) with the court, together with all documentation required by the Insolvency Code. The_
court assesses the regularity of the filing and the correctness of the class formation criteria: in this case,
the court appoints the judicial commissioner, the delegated judge and sets the deadlines for the creditors’
vote. The next stage must follow the steps of the common framework applicable to all restructuring
instruments and frameworks (i.e. composition with creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo), debt
restructuring agreement (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) and judicial liquidation (liquidazione
_giudiziale))._

From the date of filing of the petition until the approval, the debtor maintains the ordinary and
extraordinary management of the company in the best interests of the creditors under the supervision of
the court-appointed administrator.

There is no “automatic stay”: however, the debtor may file a specific request for the application of the
stay of action, in order to block creditors’ enforcement and/or precautionary actions on his assets until
the approval of the agreement (and such request may also be filed pending the negotiations for the debt
restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti)). The final decision on such application
(which is provisionally effective) will be made by the competent courts and the duration of such stay of
action period is a maximum of 4 months (subject to extensions in certain circumstances, in any event
not exceeding a total period of 12 months). During the pendency of the action, judicial liquidation
(liquidazione giudiziale) may not be opened by the courts.

In each branch, the proposal is approved if a majority of the claims admitted to vote is reached or, in
the absence thereof, if two-thirds of the claims of the voting creditors have voted in favour, on condition
that creditors holding at least half of the total claims in the same branch have voted. Secured creditors
are not eligible to vote if they are repaid in full (in cash) within 180 days (reduced to 30 days for
employees) after approval without any waiver of their security interests.

If the restructuring plan (piano di ristrutturazione) is not approved by all classes, the debtor may, inter
alia, amend the application by submitting a proposal for composition with creditors (concordato
_preventivo)._

The court will approve the restructuring plan (piano di ristrutturazione) if it is approved by all classes.
If a dissenting creditor opposes the proposal, the court approves and homologates the restructuring plan
if the proposal meets the claim to an extent not less than that arising from a court-supervised liquidation.
A creditor that has not challenged the lack of convenience in its observations may not file such an
objection unless it proves that the lack of opposition is due to a cause not imputable to it.

Against the decision of the court ruling on the approval of the restructuring plan subject to approval
(piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione), the parties may file an appeal with the competent
court of appeal within a period of 30 days from the notification of the relevant court ruling.


-----

The acts, payments and warranties/interest on the debtor’s assets performed in the implementation of
the restructuring plans subject to homologation (piani di ristrutturazione soggetti ad omologazione) and
referred to therein shall not be subject to an action for claw-back pursuant to Article 166 of the
Insolvency Code.

**_Extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria delle_**
**_grandi imprese insolventi) under the Decree 270_**

Decree No. 270 introduced a specific extraordinary administration procedure, also known as “Prodi_bis” (the “Prodi-bis Procedure”), applicable to the insolvency of large companies (the_
“Amministrazione Straordinaria”).

The objective of the Prodi-bis procedure is to guarantee the continuation of the business run by the
debtor, enabling it to recover the capacity to meet its obligations under ordinary management by the
end of the procedure, or by transferring the business (on a going-concern basis) to a third party.

To be eligible for the Prodi-bis procedure, the company must be insolvent even if it can demonstrate
serious prospects of recovery and must

(i) employ at least 200 employees in the year preceding the opening of the procedure; and

(ii) debts equal to at least two-thirds of the value of its assets, as shown in its balance sheet, and two
thirds of its revenues from sales and services in the last financial year.

Insolvent companies belonging to the group of a company that qualifies for the Prodi-bis Procedure
may be subject to the Prodi-bis Procedure, if certain conditions are met, even if they do not themselves
qualify for the Prodi-bis Procedure.

The Prodi-bis Procedure consists of two main phases:

(i) judicial phase: following an application (which may be filed by one or more creditors, the debtor

or the public prosecutor), the court determines if the company fulfils the admission requirements
and, in particular, if it is insolvent. If the company is insolvent, the court issues a decision to that
effect and appoints one or three judicial receivers to evaluate whether the company has significant
prospects for its recovery (by selling assets or reorganisation of the business) and to submit a report
to the court within 30 days. Once the court receiver’s report is obtained, the court has another 30
days to decide whether to allow the company to be admitted to the extraordinary administration
procedure or to place it in bankruptcy;

(ii) administrative phase: upon approval of the Extraordinary Administration procedure, the

extraordinary commissioner(s) appointed by the Minister of Economic Development must prepare
a restructuring plan. The plan may envisage the sale of the company as a going concern within one
year (unless extended by the Ministry of Economic Development) (the “Disposal Plan”) or a
restructuring plan leading to the economic and financial recovery of the company within two years
(unless extended by the Ministry of Economic Development) (the “Recovery Plan”). The
procedure is administered by the extraordinary commissioner(s) acting under the supervision of
the Minister of Economic Development.

Once the extraordinary administration procedure is approved, the main effects are as follows:

(i) the company continues to conduct its business and debts contracted during the Extraordinary

Administration are handled as priority claims that precede the claims of creditors whose rights
accrued prior to the beginning of the Extraordinary Administration procedure and can be paid
when due;


-----

(ii) the Extraordinary Commissioner(s) has/have the right to terminate ongoing contracts to which the

company is a party.

Moreover, under the Prodi-bis Procedure a debt restructuring plan is approved exclusively by the
Minister of Economic Development but is not subject to any vote by the creditors.

**_Extraordinary administration for the industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies_**
**_(amministrazione straordinaria per la ristrutturazione industriale delle grandi imprese insolventi)_**
**_under the Decree 347_**

Decree 347 introduced a specific extraordinary discipline for companies meeting certain size
requirements, also known as the 'Marzano Procedure’. Decree 347 is complementary to the Prodi-bis
Procedure and, unless otherwise provided for in Decree 347, the provisions of the Prodi-bis Procedure
apply. The Marzano Procedure applies only to insolvent companies that, on a consolidated basis, have
at least 500 employees in the year preceding the start of the procedure and at least 300 million euros in
outstanding debts.

Pursuant to Decree 347, the decision whether or not to open the procedure lies with the Minister of
Economic Development who, at the request of the debtor (who must at the same time file with the
competent court a petition for the declaration of its insolvency), assesses the existence of the relevant
requirements and, if so, appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s). The extraordinary commissioner
immediately becomes responsible for the management of the company. The court decides on the
company’s insolvency.

Within 180 days of the appointment (or 270 days if agreed with the Minister of Economic Development)
the extraordinary commissioner must submit to the Minister of Economic Development, for approval,
a plan for the rescue of the company through liquidation or asset restructuring, and at the same time
must file with the competent court a report on the state of the company.

A restructuring plan proposed under a procedure subject to Decree 347 may include a plan of
arrangement, with the possibility of dividing creditors into classes, with different treatments applicable
to creditors belonging to different classes, and with proposals for the cancellation of any obligations
owed by the debtor and/or the conversion of debt securities into shares in the debtor company or any of
its group companies. Decree 347 provides that an arrangement plan must be approved by creditors
according to the same majority voting rules that apply in the context of the arrangement procedure, as
described above. If the restructuring plan is not approved by the Minister of Economic Development,
the extraordinary commissioner(s) may propose an asset disposal plan. If the asset disposal plan is not
approved, the company must be put into liquidation.

When Decree 134 applies to an extraordinary administration, its purpose is generally to extend the
powers of sale. To this end, the insolvency administrator is given the power to identify and compose
branches of business or partial branches of business, even if not pre-existing, that may be subject to
sale. As a general consideration, it should be noted that under the claw-back rules applicable to the
extraordinary administration (i) the hardening period would be calculated by reference to the date of
the declaration of insolvency; and (ii) with respect to intercompany transactions only, longer hardening
periods would apply (i.e., 5 years or 3 years, depending on the type of transactions).

**_Compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa)_**

Administrative compulsory liquidation (liquidazione coatta amministrativa), as provided for in Article
293 et seq. of the Insolvency Code, is only available to public interest entities such as state-controlled
companies, insurance companies, credit institutions and other financial institutions, none of which may
be liquidated under judicial winding-up proceedings, unless otherwise provided for by Italian law. It is
irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or private sector.


-----

Administrative compulsory liquidation (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) is a special insolvency
procedure in that the entity is liquidated not by the court but by the competent administrative authority
that oversees the sector in which the entity operates. The procedure may be triggered not only by the
insolvency of the entity concerned, but also by other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant
legal provisions (e.g., as regards Italian banks, serious irregularities in the management of the bank or
serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions).

The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario
_liquidatore) is appointed to liquidate the company by the competent governmental authority (e.g., the_
Bank of Italy or the Ministry of Economic Development, which are competent to file a petition for a
declaration of insolvency with the consequent opening of compulsory administrative liquidation
proceedings). The work of the liquidator is monitored by a supervisory committee (comitato di
_sorveglianza)._

The powers attributed to the delegated judge and the court in the context of other insolvency
proceedings are assumed by the competent administrative authority in these proceedings.

The effects of administrative compulsory liquidation (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) on creditors
are largely the same as in insolvency proceedings and include, for example, the prohibition of
enforcement measures. The same rules established for insolvency proceedings with respect to existing
contracts and creditors’ claims apply to a large extent to administrative compulsory liquidation
(liquidazione coatta amministrativa).

**_Adequate organizational, administrative and accounting corporate structures_**

The Insolvency Code introduced the definition of the organizational, administrative and accounting
structures (assetto organizzativo, amministrativo e contabile) of a company considered adequate
(adeguata) pursuant to Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, which are required by the applicable
legislation for the purpose of the timely detection of a state of crisis and the taking of appropriate actions
by the debtor.

More precisely, Article 3 of the Insolvency Code requires the entrepreneur to adopt an adequate
organizational structure pursuant to Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, for the purpose of the timely
detection of the state of crisis of the enterprise as well as the timely undertaking of suitable initiatives
to overcome the crisis and recover business continuity.

Pursuant to Article 3 of the Insolvency Code:

(i) for the purposes of the timely detection of the enterprise’s state of crisis, the measures and

structures deemed appropriate must enable:

(a) detect any imbalances of an asset or economic-financial nature, related to the specific
characteristics of the enterprise as well as to the activity carried out by the debtor

(b) verify the unsustainability of the debts and the absence of any prospect of business
continuity for the next twelve months, as well as the warning signs identified in Article 3(4)
of the Insolvency Code; and

(c) obtain the information necessary to follow the detailed checklist and conduct the practical
test for the reasonable pursuit of the debtor’s financial recovery.

(ii) Warning signs are identified as, inter alia, the following:

(a) the existence of payroll debts that are at least 30 days past due and equal to more than half
of the total amount of the monthly payroll;


-----

(b) the existence of accounts receivable from suppliers that are at least 90 days past due in an
amount greater than the amount of the outstanding accounts receivable;

(c) the existence of exposures to banks and other financial intermediaries that are past due by
more than 60 days or that have exceeded the limit on credit facilities obtained in any form
for at least 60 days, provided that they collectively represent at least 5% of the total
exposures; and

(d) the existence of one or more exposures to certain public institutions listed in Article 25novies of the Insolvency Code.

**_New financial resources_**

The following is a brief summary of the main features of the provisions relating to the various loans
available under the Insolvency Code.

Interim financings – article 99, paragraphs from 1 to 4 of the Insolvency Code

According to Article 99 (1) and (2) of the Insolvency Code, in the framework of restructuring
transactions as a going concern (continuazione dell’attività aziendale), even in cases where business
continuity is exclusively preserved with a view to liquidation, upon the debtor’s request, the court, until
the approval of the debt restructuring agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti) (pursuant to
Article 57 or Article 60 or 61 of the Insolvency Code) may grant interim financing or a petition pursuant
to Article 87 of the Insolvency Code in connection with composition proceedings (concordato
_preventivo), including in the case of a “simplified petition” pursuant to Article 44 of the Insolvency_
Code, may allow the debtor to obtain new super-senior financing (finanziamenti prededucibili) and to
secure such indebtedness, upon authorisation by the court, with in rem securities (garanzie reali) or
with the assignment of claims, provided that the petition specifies:

(i) the purpose of the financing;

(ii) that the debtor is unable to obtain the necessary funds otherwise; and

(iii) that the absence of such financing will result in impending and irretrievable harm to the company’s

ability to continue as a going concern or to the proceedings;

The petition must be accompanied by the report of the expert appointed by the debtor in which the
expert, after verifying the overall financial needs of the company until the approval, states that the new
financing is functional to the continuity of the company’s business until the approval of the relevant
bankruptcy proceedings or the opening of the proceedings or their continuation and, in any event, is
intended to provide a better satisfaction of creditors’ rights. The expert’s report is not necessary if the
court recognizes the urgency of avoiding imminent and irreparable harm to the company’s continuity.
In the event of the debtor’s subsequent admission to judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale), such
financing does not benefit from super-senior priority (prededucibilità) if the petition or the expert’s
report contained false data or omitted important information or if the debtor has performed acts to the
in fraud of creditors (atti in frode ai creditori) and the liquidator demonstrates that those who made
such financing available to the debtor were aware of such facts at the date of the payment.

Bridge financings – article 99, para. 5 of the Insolvency Code

According to Article 99(5) of the Insolvency Code, financing (together with the related claims) granted,
in any form, with a view to the filing of a petition for approval of a debt restructuring agreement
(accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) or an arrangement procedure (concordato preventive) (finanza
_ponte), may be super-senior (prededucibili) provided that (i) they meet the requirements of Article 99(1)_
and (2) (as indicated above), and (ii) they are provided as part of the relevant plan and on condition that
the super-seniority (prededucibilità) is expressly set forth in the decree by which the court grants the


-----

application for admission to the composition agreement (concordato preventivo) or approves the
restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione).

The debts arising from such financing may be secured, subject to the court’s approval, by _in rem_
securities (garanzie reali) or the assignment of receivables.

Implementation financing – article 101 of the Insolvency Code

Pursuant to Article 101 of the Insolvency Code, in the context of restructuring transactions as a goingconcern (continuazione dell’attività aziendale), financing granted to the debtor in execution of an
approved composition agreement (concordato preventivo) or a debt restructuring agreement (accordo
_di ristrutturazione dei debiti) ranks super-senior (prededucibile) to the extent that it is expressly_
provided for in the relevant business continuation plan.

In the event of the debtor’s subsequent admission to judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale), such
loans do not benefit from super-senior priority (prededucibilità) if the plan of arrangement (concordato
_preventivo) or debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) has been approved,_
on the basis of an assessment to be made at the time of its filing, are founded on false data or the failure
to provide relevant information, or where the debtor has committed acts in fraud of creditors (atti in
_frode ai creditori) and the liquidator demonstrates that those who made such financing available to the_
debtor were well aware of such events at the date of the disbursement.

The shareholders’ financing – article 102 of the Insolvency Code

According to Section 102(1) of the Insolvency Code, super-seniority (prededucibilità) is also granted
for claims up to 80% of the value of shareholder loans that have been granted to the company in any
form (including any guarantee or grant of counter-indemnity) in execution or in anticipation of an
homologated composition procedure (concordato preventivo) or debt restructuring agreement (accordo
_di ristrutturazione dei debiti). Restructuring agreement (also as an exception to the subordination_
regime provided for by the Italian Civil Code for loans granted to corporations by shareholders or
persons exercising management and coordination activities).

Pursuant to Article 102(2) of the Insolvency Code, if the lender becomes a shareholder only upon
execution of the composition agreement (concordato preventivo) or debt restructuring agreement
(accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti), the senior ranking will apply to the entire amount of the loan.

Super senior ranking – article 99 para. 6 and article 101 para. 2 of the Insolvency Code

According to Article 6(1) of the Insolvency Code, providing the relevant conditions are met, claims
arising from bridge financing, interim financing and implementation financing are super-senior
(prededucibile) by virtue of the law. Pursuant to Article 6(2) of the Insolvency Code, predeductibility
remains in any subsequent insolvency or enforcement proceedings.

In specific circumstances, such loans may not have super-senior status (prededucibilità) in the event of
judicial liquidation if, inter alia, the liquidator proves that the debtor has committed acts of fraud.

In particular, for interim or bridge financing, false data or omission of relevant information are relevant
if found by the court in the request for the incurrence of the financing or in the independent expert’s
attestation, whereas for implementation financing, such elements are relevant if included in the plan
underlying the composition agreement or debt restructuring agreement.

Article 99(6) of the Insolvency Code provides that interim and bridge financing shall be treated as a
financing transaction, so that in the event of the opening of a judicial liquidation (liquidazione
giudiziale), such financing (even if authorised by the court in the context of composition proceedings
(concordato preventivo) or the debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione)) does not


-----

benefit from super senior status when it is proven (jointly) that: (i) the application or the independent
expert’s report contains false data or omits relevant information, or when the debtor has committed acts
to defraud creditors in order to obtain the authorisation; and (ii) the liquidator proves that the lender, at
the date the loan was granted, was aware of the above-mentioned circumstances.

With respect to implementation loans, Article 101(2) of the Insolvency Code provides that such loans
do not benefit from super-seniority (prededucibilità), in the event of the opening of a judicial liquidation
(liquidazione giudiziale) (alternatively) (i) when, on the basis of an assessment to be made at the time
of the filing of the application for the opening of the proceedings, the plan underlying the composition
agreement (concordato preventivo) or the debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei
debiti) turns out to be based on false data or the omission of relevant information; or (ii) when the debtor
has committed acts of fraud against its creditors and the liquidator proves that the lenders who provided
the loans were aware of such circumstances at the time the loans were granted.

**United States**

Under U.S. federal bankruptcy laws or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, under
certain circumstances:

(1) the issuance of the Guarantees by entities subject to or organized under the laws of the United
States or certain states thereof, including the State of Delaware and the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania (each, a “U.S. Guarantor”) could be avoided;

(2) claims in respect of such liens or obligations could be subordinated to some or all of its other
debts and other liabilities; and

(3) the holders of the Notes could be required to repay any amounts received in connection with
such Guarantee.

**_Federal and State Insolvency Proceedings_**

The U.S. Guarantors may have operations that would subject any one or both either to federal
bankruptcy laws under title 11 of the United States Code (the “U.S. Bankruptcy Code”) or any
applicable state law insolvency proceedings. Proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code vary and
provide a debtor with discretion in its pursuit of a liquidation or reorganization strategy. The U.S.
Bankruptcy Code provides a detailed statutory framework that, among other things, contains terms or
provisions relating to: (i) the administration of a bankruptcy case, including the provision of “adequate
_protection” to secured creditors, the automatic stay, terms for the use, sale or lease of property, standards_
for obtaining credit and the treatment of executory contracts and leases; (ii) creditors and claims,
including filing proofs of claim, priority and allowance of claims, rights of creditors and subordination
of claims; (iii) provisions relating to the creation of the bankruptcy estate, including the scope of
property of the estate and turnover and avoidance actions; (iv) liquidation under chapter 7 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code; (v) reorganization under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code; and (vi) ancillary
and cross-border insolvency cases under chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

As a general matter, chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides for the orderly liquidation of the
debtor’s assets by a trustee, and typically, a chapter 7 case results in the immediate shutdown of the
debtor’s business. Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code is available to debtors who seek to continue
to operate their business as a going-concern while they rehabilitate their businesses and restructure their
obligations to creditors. Unlike in chapter 7, the debtor in a chapter 11 case remains in control of its
assets absent court order divesting the debtor of control, and absent such a court order, the debtor
continues to operate its business during the course of the bankruptcy case subject to the limitations
imposed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and supervision of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, including that
transactions outside of the ordinary course of business require prior court approval following notice and
a hearing at which all parties in interest may be heard. In addition, “liquidating” chapter 11 cases may


-----

be utilized as an alternative to chapter 7 liquidations to provide for the sale of the debtor’s assets as a
going-concern, especially where the conversion of a pending chapter 11 case to a case under chapter 7
and the resulting shutdown of the business might result in a loss of value for the debtor’s stakeholders.

Because bankruptcy proceedings are inherently to be fact specific and vary case-by-case and because
U.S. bankruptcy courts are courts of equity with broad discretionary powers, a detailed summary of all
of the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code that could impact the Notes or the Guarantees is not
contained herein. Furthermore, the common law applicable in bankruptcy proceedings may vary from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and this summary is not intended to cover the common law that may apply
in any particular jurisdiction.

With respect to proceedings under any applicable state insolvency laws (e.g., assignments for the benefit
of creditors, receiverships or other state liquidation mechanisms) and the application of state laws in
bankruptcy proceedings (e.g., fraudulent transfer claims), the effects and outcomes of these proceedings
are fact specific, vary from state to state and require an examination of both statutory and common law,
the details of which also are not described herein. To the extent more information is required, potential
investors in the Notes should consult an insolvency professional familiar with U.S. and the applicable
state insolvency laws.

**_Delay and Risks Associated in a Federal Bankruptcy Proceeding_**

If a bankruptcy proceeding were to be commenced under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code by or against any
U.S. Guarantor, it is likely that delays will occur in enforcing the Guarantees granted by the bankrupt
U.S. Guarantor, because of specific provisions of such laws or by a court applying general principles of
equity. Aspects of federal bankruptcy laws or general principles of equity that could result in the
impairment of rights include, but are not limited to:

- the automatic stay;

- the avoidance of preferential transfers by a trustee, debtor-in-possession or other parties granted
standing by the bankruptcy court;

- the substantive consolidation of the assets and liabilities of multiple entities;

- the limitations on the collectability of unmatured interest or attorney fees;

- fraudulent transfer; and

- the forced restructuring of the bonds issued by the bankrupt company, including reduction of
principal amounts and interest rates and extension of maturity dates, or the conversion of debt
to equity interests, other forms of consideration (such as interests in a trust) or potentially
discharge of all obligations without significant recovery, over the holders’ objections.

As an initial matter, the commencement of a bankruptcy case operates as a stay, applicable to all
creditors, of virtually all private litigation against the debtor and efforts to collect prepetition claims,
enforce existing liens or impose most new liens. The stay applies to the debtor and its assets globally.
The purpose of the stay is to provide the chapter 11 debtor time to reorganize and the chapter 7 trustee
protection under which to liquidate in an orderly fashion the debtor’s assets for the benefit of creditors.
The automatic stay is also intended to shield a debtor from the pressures of creditor collection efforts.
Among other things, the automatic stay prohibits (i) all collection efforts by creditors, (ii) the
enforcement of prepetition judgments against the debtor or property of the estate, (iii) any act to create,
perfect or enforce a lien against property of the estate and (iv) the setoff of prepetition debts owing to
the debtor against debts owing by the debtor. The automatic stay ordinarily does not bar suits against
non-debtor guarantors or co-obligors, nor does it enjoin payment under a letter of credit issued by a
bank in favour of a creditor of the applicable debtor. Parties must apply to the bankruptcy court for


-----

relief from the stay prior to taking any action in violation of the stay. Any action in violation of the stay
without prior relief is void and can be the basis for sanctions, including punitive damages.

Applicable federal bankruptcy laws generally do not permit the payment or accrual of interest, costs
and attorneys’ fees for unsecured or “undersecured” claims.

**_Fraudulent Transfer Issues_**

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws that are
applicable in U.S. bankruptcy cases, the issuance of Guarantees by any U.S. Guarantor could be avoided
if, among other things, at the time the U.S. Guarantor issued the Guarantee, the applicable U.S.
Guarantor (i) intended to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditor; or (ii) received less
than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the incurrence of such indebtedness and, in
the case of (ii) either:

- was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;

- was engaged in a business or transaction for which the U.S. Guarantor’s remaining assets
constituted unreasonably small capital; or

- intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as
they mature.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the
law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, a U.S. Guarantor
would be considered insolvent if:

- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than all of its assets, at a fair
valuation;

- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to
pay its probable liabilities on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become
absolute and mature; or

- it could not pay its debts as they become due.

However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court may apply in making solvency
determinations, and different courts may reach different conclusions with regard to these issues. For
example, in an evidentiary ruling in the In re W.R. Grace & Co. bankruptcy case, the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court for the District of Delaware held that under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, whether a
transferor is rendered insolvent by a transfer depends on the actual liabilities of the transferor, and not
what the transferor knows about such liabilities at the time of the transfer. Therefore, under that court’s
analysis, liabilities that are unknown, or that are known to exist but whose magnitude is not fully
appreciated at the time of the transfer, may be taken into account in the context of a future determination
of insolvency. If the principle articulated by that court is upheld, it would make it very difficult to know
whether a transferor is solvent at the time of transfer, and would increase the risk that a transfer may in
the future be found to be a fraudulent transfer. The Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act has been enacted
into law in Delaware at 6 Del. C. §§ 1301 et seq. and in Pennsylvania at 12 Pa. C.S.A. §§ 5101 et seq.

By their terms, the Guarantee of each U.S. Guarantor will limit the liability of each such guarantor to
the maximum amount it can pay without the Guarantee being deemed a fraudulent transfer. It is not
assured, however, that this limitation will protect such guarantees from fraudulent transfer challenges
or, if it does, that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would suffice, if
necessary, to pay the Notes in full when due.


-----

In addition to the avoidance power that may be exercised in a U.S. bankruptcy, claims evidenced by the
Guarantees may, in certain circumstances, be subordinated under the equitable subordination provisions
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

**_Preference Transfers_**

A future pledge of collateral in favour of a creditor may be avoidable by the pledgor (as debtor-inpossession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy, or another party granted standing by the bankruptcy court,
if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the pledgor is insolvent at
the time of the pledge, the pledge permits the pledgee to receive a greater recovery than it would
otherwise receive in a hypothetical chapter 7 liquidation and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the
pledgor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge, or, in certain circumstances, a longer
period. Such future pledge may also be avoidable as a preferential transfer in state insolvency
proceedings under the laws of some states. In the context of a Pennsylvania assignment for the benefit
of creditors, for example, the assignee may recover payments made during the four-month period
preceding the assignment, under certain circumstances.

**_U.S. Recognition of Foreign Court Judgments_**

Judgments of foreign courts are not automatically enforceable in federal or state courts of the United
States. With respect to foreign money judgments, recognition and enforceability will be governed by
applicable state law. A majority of U.S. states, including Delaware and Pennsylvania, have adopted a
version of the Uniform Foreign Money Judgments Recognition Act (or a later revision thereof) (the
“U.S. Recognition Act”). Although variations exist among states, the U.S. Recognition Act generally
applies to any judgment granting or denying recovery of a sum of money rendered in a foreign
jurisdiction (excluding judgments for taxes, fines, penalties, matrimonial support and family matters),
so long as the judgment is final, conclusive and enforceable in the jurisdiction where rendered. Pursuant
to the U.S. Recognition Act, any such foreign judgment rendered by a court having proper personal and
subject matter jurisdiction would, subject to considerations of public policy, be recognized and enforced
by a U.S. state court that has adopted the U.S. Recognition Act (or a federal court sitting in such a state)
and that also has appropriate personal and subject matter jurisdiction without re-examination of the
merits of the case pursuant to which such foreign judgment was obtained and in the same manner as the
judgment of a sister state that is entitled to full faith and credit, in an appropriate proceeding in
accordance with the procedures of such court, provided that (i) the judgment debtor had received proper
and sufficient notice of the subject proceedings, (ii) the judgment was not obtained by fraud or by
procedures that denied the judgment debtor a fair trial before an impartial tribunal or due process of
law, (iii) the proceedings in the foreign court were not contrary to an agreement between the parties
under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in that court, (iv)
the foreign court was not a seriously inconvenient forum for the trial of the action if jurisdiction over
the judgment debtor was based only on personal service, and (v) the judgment did not conflict with
another final and conclusive judgment. In addition to the foregoing, a number of states adopting the
U.S. Recognition Act also require that the foreign court rendering the judgment reside in a jurisdiction
that will reciprocally enforce judgments of the United States courts. In states that have not adopted the
U.S. Recognition Act, principles of comity will apply. The U.S. Recognition Act represents an attempt
to codify general principles of comity, and should therefore be generally indicative of the types of
principles that non-U.S. Recognition Act states would apply in determining whether to recognize a
foreign judgment against the U.S. Guarantors.

**Luxembourg**

Pursuant to Luxembourg insolvency laws, your ability to receive payment from the Issuer under the
Notes and under the guarantees given by Lux Finco 2 (the “Luxembourg Guarantor”) may be more
limited than would be the case under U.S. bankruptcy laws. Under Luxembourg law, the following
types of proceedings (together referred to as “insolvency proceedings”) may be initiated against a
company incorporated in Luxembourg having its centre of main interests (within the meaning of EU


-----

Insolvency Regulation or an establishment in Luxembourg (in the latter case assuming that the centre
of main interests is located in a jurisdiction where the EU Insolvency Regulation is applicable):

- bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the company, by
any of its creditors or by the courts ex officio. Following such a request, the Luxembourg courts
having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings if a Luxembourg company (i) is in a state
of cessation of payments (cessation des paiements) and (ii) has lost its commercial
creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). The main effects of such proceedings are the sale of
the assets and allocation of the proceeds of such sale between creditors taking into account their
rank of privilege, as well as the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the company,
subject to certain limited exceptions under the applicable provisions of the Luxembourg law of
5 August 2005 on financial collateral arrangements, as amended (the “Financial Collateral Law
_2005”), for enforcement by secured creditors and the payment of the secured creditors in_
accordance with their rank upon realization of the assets. In addition, the managers or directors
of a Luxembourg company that ceases its payments (i.e., is unable to pay its debts as they fall
due with normal means of payment) must within a month of them having become aware of the
company’s cessation of payments, file a petition for bankruptcy (faillite) with the court clerk of
the district court of the company’s registered office. If the managers or directors fail to comply
with such provision they may be held (i) liable towards the company or any third-parties on the
basis of principles of managers’ and directors’ liability for any loss suffered and (ii) criminally
liable for simple bankruptcy (banqueroute simple) in accordance with Article 574 of the
Luxembourg commercial code;

- controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée), the opening of which may only be
requested by the company and not by its creditors and under which a Luxembourg court may
order the provisional stay of enforcement of claims except for secured creditors; or

- composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite), the opening of which may only be
requested by the company and not by its creditors directly. The Luxembourg court’s decision
to admit a company to composition proceedings triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of
claims by creditors except, among others, for secured creditors.

In addition to these proceedings, your ability to receive payment under the Notes issued by the Issuer
and the guarantees given by the Luxembourg Guarantors may be affected by a decision of a
Luxembourg court to grant a stay on payments (sursis de paiement) or to put a Luxembourg company
into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) or by an administrative dissolution without liquidation
(dissolution administrative sans liquidation).

- Judicial liquidation: judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public
prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious
breach or violation of the Luxembourg commercial code or of the Luxembourg Companies Act.
The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow similar rules as those
applicable to Luxembourg bankruptcy proceedings.

  - Suspension of payments proceedings: a suspension of payments (sursis de paiements) can only
be applied to a company which, as a result of extraordinary and unforeseeable events, has to
temporarily cease its payments but which has on the basis of its balance sheet sufficient assets
to pay all amounts due to its creditors. The suspension of payments may also be granted if the
situation of the applicant, even though showing a loss, presents serious elements of
reestablishment of the balance between its assets and its debts. The purpose of the suspension
of payments proceedings is to allow a business undertaking experiencing financial difficulties
to suspend its payments for a limited time after a complex proceeding involving both the
Commercial District Court and the Cour supérieure de justice and the approval by a majority
of the creditors representing, by their claims, three-quarters of the company's debts (excluding
claims secured by privilege (privilège), mortgage (hypothèque) or pledge (gage)). The


-----

suspension of payments is, however, not for general application, which is one of the main
reasons it has lost its attractiveness. It only applies to those liabilities which have been assumed
by the debtor prior to obtaining the suspension of payment and has no effect as far as taxes and
other public charges or secured claims (by right of privilege, a mortgage or a pledge) are
concerned. During the suspension of payments, ordinary creditors cannot open enforcement
proceedings against the applicant, or the applicant's assets. This stay on enforcement does not
extend to preferred creditors, or to creditors which are secured by mortgages (hypothèques),
pledges (gages) or financial collateral arrangements governed by the Financial Collateral Law
2005. The applicant continues to manage its own business under the supervision of a courtappointed administrator who must approve most of the transactions carried out by the applicant.
When a suspension of payments ends, the stay on enforcement is terminated and the company's
maangers can run the business again.

- Administrative Dissolution without Liquidation: administrative dissolution without liquidation
(dissolution administrative sans liquidation) is managed by the administrator of the
Luxembourg Trade and Companies Register at the request of the public prosecutor against
companies and shall only apply provided three cumulative conditions are met: (i) the company
must have no assets, (ii) the company must have no employees and (iii) the company must
pursue activities contrary to criminal law or which seriously contravene the provisions of the
Luxembourg commercial code or the Luxembourg Companies Act (including the laws
governing authorizations to do business). The administrative dissolution procedure without
liquidation is closed at the latest six (6) months after the publication of the opening decision.

Liability of the Issuer and the Luxembourg Guarantor in respect of the relevant Notes and Guarantees
will, in the event of a liquidation of the company following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation
proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such
liquidation) and any claims that are preferred under Luxembourg law. Preferential claims under
Luxembourg law include, among others:

- remuneration owed to employees (last six months’ wages amounting to a maximum of six times
the minimum social salary);

- employees’ contributions to social security;

- certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Inland Revenue;

- employer’s contribution to social security;

- landlord, pledgor not under the Financial Collateral Law 2005; and

- value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to Luxembourg Customs and Excise.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution
to unsecured and unpreferred creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realised).

Impact of Luxembourg insolvency proceedings on transactions

During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended.
Other than as described above, the ability of certain secured creditors to enforce their security interest
may also be limited, in particular in the event of controlled management proceedings expressly
providing that the rights of secured creditors are frozen until a final decision has been taken by a
Luxembourg court as to the petition for controlled management, and may be affected thereafter by a
reorganization order given by the court. A reorganisation order requires the prior approval by more than
50 per cent. of the creditors representing more than 50 per cent. of the Issuer’s or the Luxembourg
Guarantor’s liabilities in order to take effect.


-----

Furthermore, you should note that declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as
acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default) may not be enforceable during controlled
management proceedings. However, during such controlled management proceedings, a notice of
default may still be served.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the Issuer
or the Luxembourg Guarantor during the preference period (période suspecte) which is a maximum of
six months preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations the
court may set the start of the suspect period at an earlier date. In particular:

- pursuant to Article 445 of the Luxembourg code of commerce (Code de commerce), specified
transactions (such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts save
in respect of financial collateral arrangements within the meaning of the Financial Collateral
Law 2005; payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by
way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen
due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; and the sale of assets without
consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the preference
period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested
by the insolvency receiver;

- pursuant to Article 446 of the Luxembourg code of commerce, payments made for matured
debts as well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the preference period are
subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if
they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt party’s cessation of payments; and

- pursuant to Article 448 of the Luxembourg code of commerce and Article 1167 of the
Luxembourg civil code (action paulienne), the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the
creditors) has the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the
granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time
limit.

In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in the automatic
termination of contracts except for employment agreements and powers of attorney. The contracts,
therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy order. However, the bankruptcy receiver may choose to terminate
certain contracts so as to avoid worsening the financial situation of the company. As of the date of
adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue _vis-à-vis the bankruptcy_
estate. Insolvency proceedings may hence have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s or the
Luxembourg Guarantor’s business and assets or the Issuer’s or Luxembourg Guarantor’s respective
obligations under the Notes.

Finally, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or composition
proceedings may be subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation. In particular, rights in rem over assets
located in another jurisdiction where the EU Insolvency Regulation applies will not be affected by the
opening of insolvency proceedings, without prejudice however to the applicability of rules relating to
the voidness, voidability or unenforceability of legal acts detrimental to all the creditors (subject to the
application of Article 24 of the Financial Collateral Law 2005 and Article 16 of the EU Insolvency
Regulation).

**Luxembourg Guarantee Considerations**

The Luxembourg Companies Act does not provide for rules governing the ability of a Luxembourg
company to guarantee the indebtedness of another entity of the same group. A company may give a
guarantee provided the giving of the guarantee is covered by the company’s corporate purpose,
corporate benefit and is in the best interest of the company.


-----

Although no statutory definition of corporate benefit (intérêt social) exists under Luxembourg law,
corporate benefit is widely interpreted and includes any transactions from which the company derives
a direct or indirect economic or commercial benefit in return (such as an economic or commercial
benefit) and whether the benefit is proportionate to the burden of the assistance. It is generally held that
within a group of companies, the corporate interest of each individual corporate entity can include, to a
certain extent, the interest of the group, and that the existence of a group interest can in certain cases
result in the guarantee being held enforceable even where corporate benefit is not established. In this
way, reciprocal assistance from one group company to another does not necessarily conflict with the
interest of the assisting company.

However, this assistance must be temporary, in proportion to the real financial means of the assisting
company (i.e., limited to an aggregate amount not exceeding the assisting company’s own funds
(capitaux propres)), the company must receive some benefit or there must be a balance between the
respective commitments of all the affiliates and the companies involved must form part of a genuine
group operating under a common strategy aimed at a common objective. As a result, the
guarantees/security interests granted by a Luxembourg company may be subject to limitations in order
to ensure their enforceability. Further, a guarantee or security interest that substantially exceeds the
guarantor’s or security provider’s ability to meet its obligations to the beneficiary of the
guarantee/security provider and to its other creditors, or from which the Luxembourg company derives
no or very limited direct benefit in return, or where no direct or indirect consideration is granted to the
company in exchange, would expose its directors or managers to personal liability.

In addition to any criminal and civil liability incurred by the directors or managers of the Luxembourg
company, in extreme circumstances the guarantee or security interest could itself be held unenforceable,
if it is held that it is contrary to public policy (ordre public), in the case of facts consisting of a misuse
of corporate assets. Any up-stream or cross-stream guarantee granted in connection with the Notes by
Luxembourg companies will be limited to a certain percentage of, among others, the relevant company’s
net worth.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other transfer of
any of the Notes offered hereby.

The Notes and the Guarantees (together, the “Securities”) have not been and will not be registered under
the U.S. Securities Act, or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and, unless so registered, may
not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and the securities laws of any other applicable
jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Securities offered hereby are being offered and sold only to qualified
institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act) in reliance on Rule 144A
under the U.S. Securities Act and in offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons outside of the U.S. (in
each case, as defined in Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act.

We use the terms “offshore transaction,” “U.S. person” and the “United States” with the meanings
given to them in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of the Securities (other than the Initial Purchasers), by its acceptance thereof, will be
deemed to have acknowledged, represented to, warranted to and agreed with the Issuer, each Guarantor
and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) The purchaser understands and acknowledges that the Securities have not been registered under

Securities are being offered for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the U.S.
Securities Act or any other securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A under the
U.S. Securities Act, and, unless so registered, may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred
except in compliance with the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and any other
applicable securities laws or pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in any transaction not
subject thereto and in each case in compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in
paragraphs (4) and (5) below;

within the meaning of Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act and is aware that any
sale of these Securities to them will be made in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S.
Securities Act, and such acquisition will be for their own account or for the account of
another qualified institutional buyer; or

(b) is not a U.S. person (and is not purchasing the Securities for the account or benefit of
a U.S. person) and is purchasing the Securities outside the United States in an offshore
transaction in accordance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act;

(3) The purchaser acknowledges that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, or the Initial Purchasers,
nor any person representing any of them, has made any representation to it with respect to us
or the offer or sale of any of the Securities, other than the information contained in this Offering
Memorandum, which Offering Memorandum has been delivered to it and upon which it is
relying in making its investment decision with respect to the Securities. It acknowledges that
neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial Purchasers make any
representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of this Offering Memorandum.
It has had access to such financial and other information concerning us and the Securities as it
has deemed necessary in connection with its decision to purchase any of the Securities,
including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request information from, the Issuer and the
Initial Purchasers;


-----

(4) The purchaser is purchasing the Securities for its own account, or for one or more investor
accounts for which it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case, for investment, and not with
a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the
U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, subject to any requirement
of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts
be at all times within its or their control and subject to its or their ability to resell such Securities
to a qualified institutional buyer pursuant to Rule 144A, to non-U.S. persons in offshore
transactions pursuant to Regulation S or any other exemption from registration available under
the U.S. Securities Act, or in any transaction not subject to the U.S. Securities Act;

(5) The purchaser understands and agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account
for which it is purchasing the Securities, and each subsequent holder of the Securities by its
acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Securities
prior to the date (the “Resale Restriction Termination Date”) that is one year (in the case of
Rule 144A Notes) or 40 days (in the case of Regulation S Notes) after the later of the date of
the original issue and the last date on which we or any of our affiliates were the owner of such
Securities (or any predecessor thereto) only (i) to us, (ii) pursuant to a registration statement
that has been declared effective under the U.S. Securities Act, (iii) for so long as the Securities
are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act, to a person it

any applicable state securities laws, and any applicable local laws and regulations, and further
subject to our and the Trustee’s rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer (I) pursuant to
clause (v) to require the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certification and/or other information
satisfactory to each of them and (II) in each of the foregoing cases, to require that a certificate
of transfer in the form appearing on the reverse of the security is completed and delivered by
the transferor to the Trustee. The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to
the Resale Restriction Termination Date (as defined below);

these Securities.

(7) The purchaser agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the Securities notice
of any restrictions on the transfer of such Securities;

(8) The purchaser acknowledges that the Registrar will not be required to accept for registration or
transfer any Securities acquired by it except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the
Issuer and the Registrar that the restrictions set forth therein have been complied with;

(10) The purchaser understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the
United States) by the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of
the Securities or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or
any other material relating to us or the Securities in any jurisdiction where action for such
purpose is required. Consequently, any transfer of the Securities will be subject to the selling
restrictions set forth under “Plan of Distribution” and “Notice to Investors.”

(11) The purchaser represents that it is not a “retail investor” in the U.K. For purposes of this
paragraph, the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of:

a. a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as

it forms part of U.K. domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or

b. a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or

regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive,
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of
Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue
of the EUWA; or

c. not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the U.K. Prospectus Regulation.

(12) The purchaser understands and acknowledge that no key information document required by the
EU PRIIPs Regulation or the U.K. PRIIPs Regulation in the U.K. or for offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or in the U.K. has been
prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to
any retail investor in the EEA or the U.K. may be unlawful under the EU PRIIPs Regulation or
the U.K. PRIIPs Regulation.

(13) The purchaser represents that it is a “relevant person,” where “relevant persons” are persons
who are: (i) persons who have professional experience in matters relating to investments falling
within Article 19(5) of the Financial Promotion Order (the “Order”); (ii) persons falling within
Article 49 (“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations, etc.”) of the Order;
(iii) persons outside the United Kingdom; or (iv) persons to whom an invitation or inducement
to engage in investment activity within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA in connection
with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to
be communicated.

(14) The purchaser represents that it is not a “retail investor” in the EEA. For purposes of this
paragraph, the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of

a. a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or

b. (a customer within the meaning of Insurance Distribution Directive, where that

customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or

c. not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation.

confirmed that it does not accept or assume any liability to parties, such as the purchasers of the Notes,
other than their members as a body, with respect to the reports and to the independent auditors’ audit
work and opinions. The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration
statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the U.S.
Securities Act or in a report filed under the U.S. Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were
to give effect to the language quoted above, the recourse that investors in the Notes may have against
the independent auditors based on their reports or the consolidated financial statements to which they
relate could be limited. As the offered securities have not been, and will not be, registered under the
U.S. Securities Act, Ernst & Young LLP has not filed a consent under the U.S. Securities Act.

**ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

_The Issuer is incorporated in Luxembourg and many of the Guarantors are incorporated in England_
_and Wales. Other Guarantors are organised under the laws of Luxembourg, Denmark, Germany, Italy_
_and the United States, and future Guarantors may also be organised under the laws of non-U.S._
_jurisdictions. Many of our directors and executive officers are non-residents of the United States._
_Although we have submitted to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action_
_under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on_
_our directors and executive officers. In addition, as many of our ‘assets and the assets of our directors_
_and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against_
_them or us judgments obtained in the U.S. courts predicated on civil liability provisions of the federal_
_securities laws of the United States._

_If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against us, investors will need to enforce such judgment in_
_jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court_
_judgments outside the United States is described below for the countries in which the Issuer and the_
_Guarantors are located, you should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as_
_needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States._

**England and Wales**

The United States and the United Kingdom currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial
matters.

A final and conclusive judgment for a debt or definite sum of money issued by a federal or state court
in the United States may (subject to the conditions below) be enforced at common law in England and
Wales _provided that the party against whom the judgment was given properly submitted to the_
jurisdiction of the relevant courts in accordance with English rules on the conflict of laws. In order to
enforce any such US judgment in England or Wales, proceedings must first be initiated before a court
of competent jurisdiction in England or Wales. In such an action, the court would not generally
reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the US court (subject to what is stated below)
and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is
no good defense to it). However, an English or Welsh court may decline to enforce a US judgment
where:

- the U.S. judgment was procured by fraud;

- the U.S. judgment was given contrary to the English rules of natural or substantial justice, for
example the defendant was not given due notice of the original proceedings or was not given an
adequate opportunity to be heard in the original proceedings, or the defendant did not have the
opportunity to correct procedural irregularities under the laws of the court giving judgment;

- recognition of the U.S. judgment would be contrary to English public policy;

- recognition of the U.S. judgment would violate the Human Rights Act 1998;

- the U.S. judgment conflicts with an earlier English judgment, or foreign judgment that is
enforceable in an English court;

- the proceedings that resulted in the judgment were brought in breach of a binding arbitration
agreement or a contractual choice of court agreement or where recognition or enforcement of the
judgment would be contrary to the terms of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982;


-----

- enforcement of the U.S. judgment would involve the enforcement of foreign taxes, fines or penalties
(which involves payment to the State as distinct from an individual) or revenue or other public law;

- enforcement of the U.S. judgment would contravene Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests
Act 1980, which precludes, among other things, the enforcement by any court in the United
Kingdom of any judgment given by a court of an overseas country which is a judgment for multiple
damages which exceed the compensatory element of the judgment award; or

- enforcement of the U.S. judgment is time-barred or outside any relevant limitation periods.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England and Wales judgments in civil and
commercial matters that have been obtained from US federal or state courts. Nevertheless, we cannot
assure you that those judgments will be enforceable in England and Wales.

**Denmark**

The United States and Denmark currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition
and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters.
Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States
based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not be
recognised or enforceable in Denmark without a review of the merits of the case.

However, according to limited case law, which is based on non-statutory grounds and which does not
relate to recognition and enforcement of a judgment rendered by a U.S. federal or state court, a Danish
courts may—under certain circumstances and preconditions—recognise judgements from outside the
EU, provided that the parties have agreed to the jurisdiction in question and to the domestic laws thereof,
in each case subject to Danish principles of justice (ordre public) and assuming that such judgement
does not include any material defects.

Subject to the foregoing, it is uncertain to what extent investors may be able to enforce judgments in
Denmark in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. In
the predominant situations, it would be necessary to initiate legal proceedings before a Danish court for
the purpose of reinvestigating the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. federal or state
courts.

**Germany**

Certain of the guarantors and security providers are formed under the laws of Germany: Heide-Park
Soltau GmbH, LEGOLAND Deutschland Freizeitpark GmbH, Legoland Deutschland GmbH, Sea Life
Deutschland GmbH, Madame Tussauds Deutschland GmbH, Dungeon Deutschland GmbH, Merlin
Entertainments Group Deutschland GmbH, Tussauds Deutschland GmbH and LLD Share GmbH & Co.
KG.

There is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on federal or state securities
laws of the United States, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in
U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and the Federal Republic of Germany currently do not
have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than
arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. The enforceability of final judgments therefore may
depend on the laws of the relevant U.S. state and federal laws of the United States. Consequently, a
final judgment for payment given by any federal or state court in the United States, whether or not
predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in
Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced
in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set
forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court


-----

generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted
below.

German courts will, in particular, not recognize and enforce such judgments if the judgment is not final
under applicable U.S. federal or state law or if any of the reasons for excluding enforceability set forth
in section 328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure exist:

- if, pursuant to German law, the U.S. federal or state court having rendered the foreign judgment did
not have jurisdiction;

- if process has not been duly served or has not been served in a timely fashion to permit a defense,
_provided that the defendant did not actively participate in such process and pleads accordingly;_

- if the judgment is incompatible with a prior judgment rendered by a German court or by a foreign
court which is to be recognized in Germany;

- if the judgment, or the proceeding resulting in the judgment, to be recognized is incompatible with
a proceeding in Germany which was pending (rechtshängig) before a German court before the U.S.
federal or state court entered its judgment;

- if a recognition of the judgment would be obviously incompatible with essential principles of
German law, in particular, if the recognition would be incompatible with the civil rights
(Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and

- if reciprocity is not ensured (i.e., the U.S. federal or state courts would not recognize and enforce a
comparable judgment by a German court in equivalent circumstances).

Subject to the foregoing, holders of the Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial
matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Germany. There is some German case law to the
effect that reciprocity of the recognition of judgments is ensured in relation to claims relating to assets
(vermögensrechtliche Ansprüche) with regard to various U.S. states. We cannot, however, assure you
that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. It is also doubtful whether a German
court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action solely predicated by U.S.
federal securities laws.

In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages are usually denied by German courts
as incompatible with the essential principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the
amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are
necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.

Consequently, judgments awarding monetary damages under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S.
federal securities laws may not be enforceable to the extent they provide for a compensation that would
qualify as being of a penal or punitive nature.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In so
far as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based
on common law provided for pretrial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may,
prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and/or the deposition of
witnesses. Evidence obtained in this matter may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such
pretrial discovery process exists under German law.

In addition, it may under certain circumstances also not be possible for investors to effect service of
process within Germany upon the German Notes Guarantors or those persons under the Convention on
the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of
November 15, 1965 and the German law implementing such convention if such service were deemed
to infringe German sovereignty or security, which may be the case if such service violated the


-----

fundamental principles of German law, in particular the civil rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue
of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz). However, the German Constitutional Court
(Bundesverfassungsgericht) held in 2013 that service may not be denied solely because the action before
the U.S. court contains claims for punitive damages.

**Italy**

Recognition and enforcement in Italy of final judgments rendered by U.S. courts, including judgments
obtained in actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities
laws, may not require retrial and will be enforceable in Italy, provided that pursuant to Article 64 of
Italian Law No. 218 of 31 May 1995 (Riforma del sistema italiano di diritto internazionale privato),
amongst others, the following conditions are met:

- the U.S. court which rendered the final judgment had jurisdiction according to Italian law
principles of jurisdiction;

- the relevant summons and complaint were appropriately served on the defendants in accordance
with U.S. law and during the proceedings the essential rights of the defendant have not been
violated;

- the parties to the proceeding appeared before the court in accordance with U.S. law or, in the
event of default by the defendant, the U.S. court declared such default in accordance with U.S.
law;

- the judgment is final and not subject to any further appeal in accordance with U.S. law;

- there is no conflicting final judgment rendered by an Italian court;

- there is no action pending in Italy amongst the same parties for decision on the same matter
which commenced prior to the action in the United States; and

- the provisions of such judgment would not violate Italian public policy (ordine pubblico).

In addition, pursuant to Article 67 of Italian Law No. 218 of 31 May 1995, if a judgment rendered by a
U.S. court is not complied with, its recognition is challenged or its compulsory enforcement is
necessary, then a proceeding shall be initiated before the competent Court of Appeal in the Republic of
Italy to that end. The competent Court of Appeal does not consider the merits of the case but exclusively
ascertains the fulfilment of all the conditions set out above.

In original actions brought before Italian courts, the enforceability of liabilities or remedies based solely
on the U.S. federal securities law is debatable. In addition, in original actions brought before Italian
courts, Italian courts may apply not only Italian rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive
provisions of Italian law that are regarded as mandatory, and may refuse to apply U.S. law provisions
or grant some of the remedies sought if their application violates any Italian public policies and/or any
mandatory provisions of Italian law.

**Luxembourg**

The Issuer and Lux Finco 2 are incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg. A substantial portion of
the assets of the Issuer and Lux Finco 2 is located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be
possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer and Lux Finco
2, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of
U.S. federal or state securities laws.

The United States and Luxembourg are not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial
matters. An enforceable judgment for the payment of monies rendered by any U.S. Federal or state


-----

court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. securities laws, would not
directly be enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a party who received such favourable judgment in a
U.S. court may initiate enforcement proceedings in Luxembourg (exequatur) by requesting enforcement
of the U.S. judgment by the District Court (Tribunal d’Arrondissement) pursuant to Section 678 of the
New Luxembourg Code of Civil Procedure. The District Court will authorize the enforcement in
Luxembourg of the U.S. judgment if it is satisfied that all of the following conditions are met:

- the U.S. judgment is enforceable (exécutoire) in the United States;

- the U.S. court awarding the judgment must have had jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective
matter both under applicable U.S. Federal or state jurisdictions rules, and under applicable
Luxembourg international private law conflict of jurisdiction rules and local law;

- the U.S. court has applied the substantive law as designated by Luxembourg conflict of laws
rules, or at least, the order must not contravene the principles underlying those rules (based on
case law and legal doctrine, it is not certain that this condition would still be required for an
exequatur to be granted by a Luxembourg court);

- the U.S. judgment does not contravene international public policy or order as understood under
the laws of Luxembourg or has not been given in proceedings of a tax, penal or criminal nature
(which would include awards of damages made under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S.
federal securities laws, or other laws, to the extent that the same would be classified by
Luxembourg courts as being of a penal or punitive nature (for example, fines or punitive
damages)). Ordinarily an award of monetary damages would not be considered as a penalty,
but if the monetary damages include punitive damages, such punitive damages may be
considered as a penalty;

- the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws;

- the principles of fair trial and due process have been complied with and in particular the U.S.
judgment was granted following proceedings where the counterparty had the opportunity to
appear, and if it appeared, to present a defence; and

- the U.S. judgment was not granted pursuant to an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude à la loi
_luxembourgeoise)._

Subject to the above conditions, Luxembourg courts tend not to review the merits of a foreign judgment,
although there is no statutory prohibition to do so.

If an original action is brought in Luxembourg, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated
law (i) if the choice of such law was not made bona fide and (ii) if its application contravenes
Luxembourg public policy or is manifestly incompatible with Luxembourg international policy rules.
In an action brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg
courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought. Also, an exequatur may be refused
in respect of punitive damages.

Further, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary
obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than euro, a Luxembourg court would have power
to give judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than euro. However, enforcement of the
judgment against any party in Luxembourg would be available only in euro and for such purposes all
claims or debts would be converted into euro.

# SECTION 1 BASIS OF PREPARATION

13 weeks ended 1 April 2023 (2022: 13 weeks ended 26 March 2022)

**1.1** **BASIS OF PREPARATION**

Motion JVco Limited (the Company) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements as at and for the
13 weeks ended 1 April 2023 (2022: 13 weeks ended 26 March 2022) comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) and the
Group’s interests in jointly controlled entities. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the 53 weeks ended 31 December 2022 are
available on request from the Company’s registered office at Link House, 25 West Street, Poole, Dorset, BH15 1NQ.

All values are stated in £ million (£m) except where otherwise indicated.

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 ‘Interim financial reporting’ as adopted by the UK. They
do not include all of the information required for full annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the
Group as at and for the 53 weeks ended 31 December 2022.

These interim financial statements are not statutory accounts. The statutory accounts for the 53 weeks ended 31 December 2022 have been reported on by the
Company’s auditors. The auditor’s report was (i) unqualified, (ii) did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditors drew attention by way of
emphasis without qualifying their report, and (iii) did not contain a statement under section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.

**Going concern**
The Group reported a loss for the period of £72 million and generated operating cash inflows of £62 million. In the equivalent period for 2022, the Group
generated operating cash inflows of £19 million, and went on to generate £622 million for the full year.

As at 1 April 2023, the Group had a cash balance of £189 million and available undrawn facilities of £370 million relating to the Group’s revolving credit facility
(RCF), with no unexpected post balance sheet changes in liquidity. In line with our forecasts, we have seen cash outflows between the reporting date and the date
of approval of the condensed consolidated financial statements that reflect the normal seasonality of trading, combined with ongoing capital investment.

The Group’s sources of financing and its net debt at the reporting date are detailed in note 4.1. A financial covenant exists in relation to the Group’s £400 million
RCF, which applies when the RCF is drawn by 40% or more (net of cash and cash equivalents). It requires the Group to maintain adjusted consolidated senior secured
leverage below 10x. With effect from June 2021, the Group agreed with its RCF lenders to waive the leverage covenant until Q3 2023. The terms of the waiver
agreement require the Group to maintain a minimum liquidity of £75 million (to include amounts undrawn from the RCF, and cash and cash equivalents), over the
period of the waiver. The Group has complied with all covenants and the terms of the waiver agreement throughout the period.

Projections and forecasts prepared for the going concern assessment period to the end of Q3 2024 are derived from the Group’s 2023 budget, completed in Q4
2022, and its longer term strategic plan, both approved by the Merlin Board in December 2022, and as updated for recent developments. Cash flow forecasts up to
the end of Q3 2024 indicate that, under a base case model, the Group will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities as they fall due. In this base case, there would
be no breach of lending facilities taking into account the terms of the covenant calculations. Adequate liquidity is maintained through the entire assessment period
to Q3 2024.

Stress testing has been performed to model scenarios which would cause a liquidity shortfall or covenant breach within the going concern assessment period. These
scenarios have been assessed and have been deemed remote. Our assessment indicates that the Group would still have sufficient funds to enable it to operate
within its available facilities and settle its liabilities as they fall due through the going concern assessment period.

After reviewing the Group’s statement of financial position, available facilities, cash flow forecasts and trading budgets, the Directors believe the Group to be
operationally and financially robust and have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the next
twelve months. Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its condensed consolidated financial statements.

**Significant accounting policies**
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements refer to Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as profit before finance income and costs, taxation,
depreciation and amortisation, share-based payments and is after taking account of attributable profit after tax of joint controlled entities. The consolidated financial
statements for the 53 weeks to 31 December 2022 referred to EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as profit before finance income and costs, taxation, depreciation and
amortisation and is after taking account of attributable profit after tax of joint controlled entities.

The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are the same as the policies applied by the Group
in its consolidated financial statements as at and for the 53 weeks ended 31 December 2022, except for the adoption as of 1 January 2023 of the following new
standards and interpretations. These have been adopted by the Group with no significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

- Amendments to IAS 12 ‘Income taxes – deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction’

- Amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of financial statements – disclosure of accounting policies’

- Amendments to IAS 8 ‘Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors – definition of accounting estimates’

**2.1** **LOSS BEFORE TAX (CONTINUED)**

**Seasonality of operations**
The Group’s portfolio of attractions operates with varying seasonality patterns. The result for the period is therefore not representative of trading for the whole
Group across a full calendar year, with the majority of the theme park resorts being closed or operating reduced offerings over the winter period.

- The Group’s Midway attractions are predominantly indoor attractions that operate year round, with trading volumes generally higher around holiday periods.

- Certain of the theme parks operate year round. Others, including all of the theme parks located in the UK and Europe, are closed over all or part of the winter
period, with trading more focused on accommodation offerings and events. All parks see trading volumes higher around holiday periods, particularly the main
summer trading season.

**2.3** **TAXATION**

The tax credit (2022: charge) on the loss before taxation for the 13 weeks ended 1 April 2023 (2022: 13 weeks ended 26 March 2022) is based on the estimated full
year effective tax rate. The increase in the effective rate is primarily a result of the change in estimates of the geographical split of the Group’s full year profits.

In April 2019 the European Commission (EC) announced its final decision that certain elements of the UK’s Controlled Foreign Company rules partially represent
State Aid and in February 2021, the Group received charging notices from HMRC for £28 million, which have been paid. The UK Government made an annulment
application against the EC decision, however in June 2022 the EU General Court dismissed the UK’s application. The UK has subsequently lodged an appeal to the
Court of Justice of the European Union. The Group expects the appeal will ultimately be successful and accordingly the payments are held as a receivable in noncurrent assets. If the appeal is ultimately unsuccessful then this could result in an increase in the Group’s future effective tax rate.

#### CONTINUED
# FINANCING

13 weeks ended 1 April 2023 (2022: 13 weeks ended 26 March 2022)

**4.1** **NET DEBT (CONTINUED)**

The terms of the floating rate debt facility require a repayment of 0.25% of the outstanding principal amount of the USD borrowings every three months.

At the end of the period the Group had $810 million of fixed interest rate notes and $1,338 million of drawn floating rate facilities. The Group has entered into
$600 million of interest rate swaps, hedging USD LIBOR floating rate debt to 2026, at an average fixed rate of c.3.15%.

At the end of the period the Group had has €870 million of fixed interest rate notes and €1,460 million of drawn floating rate facilities. The Group has entered into
€700 million of interest rate caps maturing in 2026 at an average cap strike rate of c.1.61% at a running cost of c.0.9% per annum to 2026.

In aggregate, at the end of the period, 67% (31 December 2022: 67%) of the Group’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings is at a fixed/capped rate for a weighted
average period of 4 years (31 December 2022: 4 years)

Covenants
A financial covenant has existed from 30 September 2020 but is only required when the revolving credit facility is drawn by 40% or more (net of cash and cash
equivalents). The covenant requires the Group to maintain adjusted consolidated senior secured leverage below 10x. Effective June 2021, the Group agreed with its
revolving facility lenders to waive the leverage covenant until Q3 2023. As part of this agreement the Group is required to maintain a minimum liquidity of
£75 million (to include amounts undrawn from the revolving credit facility, and cash and cash equivalents), over the period of the waiver.

**4.2** **FAIR VALUES**

**Fair value hierarchy**
The Group analyses financial instruments in the following ways:

- Level 1: uses unadjusted quoted prices in active markets.

- Level 2: uses inputs that are derived directly or indirectly from observable prices (other than quoted prices).

- Level 3: uses inputs that are not based on observable market data.

**Fair value versus carrying amounts**
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are presented in the table below, together with the carrying amounts shown in the statement of financial position.
Short term receivables, payables and cash and cash equivalents have been excluded from the following disclosures on the basis that their carrying amount is a
reasonable approximation to fair value.

reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the
Company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion:

- the financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group’s and of
the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2022 and of the Group’s
profit for the 53 weeks then ended;

- the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards;

- the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards as
applied in accordance with section 408 of the Companies Act 2006;
and

- the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the
requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

**Basis for opinion**
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under
those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the
audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent
of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant
to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical
Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with these requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Conclusions relating to going concern**
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors’
use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the
financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material
uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively,
may cast significant doubt on the Group and Company’s ability to continue
as a going concern for a period of 18 months from when the financial
statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect
to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted,
this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group and Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern.


**Other information**
The other information comprises the information included in the Annual
Report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
The Directors are responsible for the other information contained within the
Annual Report.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information
and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial
statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise
appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies
or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether
this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements
themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there
is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report
that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

**Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006**
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

- the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

- the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report have been prepared in
accordance with applicable legal requirements.

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the
Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we
have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or
Directors’ Report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to
which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or
returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches
not visited by us; or

- the Company financial statements are not in agreement with the
accounting records and returns; or

- certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are
not made; or

- we have not received all the information and explanations we require
for our audit.

**Responsibilities of directors**
The Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for
such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
#### To the Members of Motion JVco Limited


In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for
assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using
the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to
liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no
realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of
users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

**Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of**
**detecting irregularities, including fraud**
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and
regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined
above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a
material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by,
for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.
The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities,
including fraud is detailed below. However, the primary responsibility for the
prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with
governance of the entity and management.

Our approach was as follows:

- We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks
that are applicable to the Group and Company and determined that
the most significant which are directly relevant to specific assertions
in the financial statements, are those that relate to the reporting
framework (International Accounting Standards in conformity with
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, and FRS 101 and the
Companies Act 2006), Health and Safety regulations and the relevant
tax compliance regulations in the jurisdictions in which the
Group operates.

- We understood how Motion JVco Limited is complying with those
frameworks by making enquiries of management, those responsible for
legal and compliance procedures and the Company Secretary.We
corroborated our enquiries through our reading of Board and other
relevant Committee minutes, discussions with the Audit Committee,
review of whistleblowing reports and any correspondence received
from regulatory bodies.



- We assessed the susceptibility of the Group and Company’s financial
statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur,
by meeting with management and those charged with governance to
understand where there was susceptibility to fraud.We also
considered performance targets and their influence on efforts made
by management to manage earnings or influence the perceptions of
the users of the financial statements.

- Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to
identify irregularities including fraud. With support from relevant
specialists, we performed audit procedures, including testing journal
entries and other adjustments for appropriateness, which were
designed to provide reasonable assurance the financial statements
were free from material fraud or error. Our procedures involved
reading of Board minutes and relevant reporting from the Company’s
legal counsel to identify non-compliance with such laws and
regulations, reading reporting to the Audit Committee on compliance
with regulations, enquiries of legal counsel, Group management,
the Audit Committee, internal audit and subsidiary management at
all full-scope components and review of any relevant
investigations undertaken.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at
**www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.This description forms part of**
our auditor’s report.

**Use of our report**
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for
no other purpose.To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed.

# SECTION 1 BASIS OF PREPARATION

53 weeks ended 31 December 2022 (2021: 52 weeks ended 25 December 2021)

**1.1** **BASIS OF PREPARATION**

Motion JVco Limited (the Company) is a private company limited by shares which is incorporated in the United Kingdom. Its registered office is Link House, 25 West
Street, Poole, Dorset, BH15 1LD.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards. The
Company prepares its parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards, including Financial Reporting
Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101).

This section sets out the Group’s accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole. Where an accounting policy is specific to one note, the policy
is described in the note to which it relates. The accounting policies have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these
consolidated financial statements and have been applied consistently by all subsidiaries and joint ventures.

The Group prepares its annual consolidated financial statements on a 52 or 53 week basis. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared for the
53 weeks ended 31 December 2022 (2021: 52 weeks ended 25 December 2021).

The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments and certain investments which are measured
at their fair value. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling. All values are stated in £ million (£m) except where otherwise indicated.

**Going concern**
The Group reported a profit for the year of £89 million (2021: loss of £140 million) and generated operating cash inflows of £622 million (2021: £459 million). The
Board has assessed the Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern to the end of Q3 2024 (being the ‘going concern assessment period’). The
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which the Directors consider to be appropriate for the reasons set out below.

Funding
The going concern assessment considers the Group’s projected liquidity position and headroom over covenant thresholds from existing committed financing facilities
throughout the going concern assessment period. As at 31 December 2022, the Group had a cash balance of £266 million and available undrawn facilities of
£370 million relating to the Group’s revolving credit facility (RCF), with no unexpected post balance sheet changes in liquidity. In line with our forecasts, we have
seen cash outflows between the reporting date and the date of approval of the financial statements that reflect the normal seasonality of trading, combined with
ongoing capital investment. The Group’s sources of financing and its net debt at the reporting date are detailed in notes 5.1 and 5.2.

A financial covenant exists in relation to the Group’s £400 million RCF, which applies when the RCF is drawn by 40% or more (net of cash and cash equivalents). It
requires the Group to maintain adjusted consolidated senior secured leverage below 10x. With effect from June 2021, the Group agreed with its RCF lenders to
waive the leverage covenant until Q3 2023. The terms of the waiver agreement require the Group to maintain a minimum liquidity of £75 million (to include amounts
undrawn from the RCF, and cash and cash equivalents), over the period of the waiver. The Group has complied with all covenants and the terms of the waiver
agreement throughout the year.

Base case
The projections and forecasts prepared for the going concern assessment period to the end of Q3 2024 are derived from the Group’s 2023 budget, completed in Q4
2022, and its longer term strategic plan, both approved by the Merlin Board in December 2022. This period has been selected as the going concern assessment
period to ensure that it includes the likely liquidity low point in the next trading cycle.

Our ‘base case’ forecast over the going concern assessment period is based on what we believe is a balanced approach. In this base case, we have made certain key
assumptions:

- The base case includes the expected positive impact of continued revenue initiatives and management actions to mitigate inflationary cost pressures, while
maintaining the customer experience. Utility costs modelled are based on contracted or forward rates where appropriate. Where contracted rates are not
available, utility costs have been modelled using market rates, taking into account the significant inflation seen in this area.

- The impact of the rising cost of living on our guests has been considered, utilising data derived from trading periods overlapping with historic global recessions
and considering any impact to current trading. We do not expect any significant impact to visitation numbers. Marketing strategies to stimulate visitation can be
implemented as required.

- It is expected that the recovery of international tourism will continue. At the time of approving these financial statements the only elements of our portfolio
that are significantly affected by restrictions on international travel are parts of the Asia Pacific region, primarily China.

- Expansionary capital expenditure on planned attractions will continue throughout the assessment period, alongside ongoing capital expenditure at existing
attractions to ensure the health and safety of our guests and staff.

- The base case specifically excludes any potential acquisitions over the period, or any strategic initiatives yet to be approved by the Merlin Board.

- We assume that the covenant waiver remains in place until Q3 2023, after which the financial covenant applies should the RCF be drawn by 40% or more.
Under the base case, the RCF is not forecast to be drawn to this extent during the assessment period.

- Interest rates modelled during the assessment period are based on forward market rates, and reflect the hedging arrangements in place (see note 5.3).


-----

# SECTION 1

#### CONTINUED
# BASIS OF PREPARATION

53 weeks ended 31 December 2022 (2021: 52 weeks ended 25 December 2021)

**1.1** **BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)**

- We have assessed that the likelihood of any future COVID-19 related lockdowns and restrictions that would affect a significant part of our attractions portfolio
is remote. Hence, no further closures or government related capacity constraints have been modelled within the going concern assessment period. During
2021 and 2022 the business demonstrated its ability to trade even while restrictions were in place.

The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for an 18-month period from the date of approval of these financial statements up to the end of Q3 2024 which
indicate that, under the base case, the Group will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities as they fall due.

In this base case, there would be no breach of lending facilities taking into account the terms of the covenant calculations. Adequate liquidity is maintained through
the entire assessment period to Q3 2024. There are no significant restrictions on intra group liquidity transfers as required, and no material capital repayments
of debt falling due within the going concern assessment period, with the next maturity of facilities being in respect of €500 million of 7.0% senior secured notes
due 2025.

Downside scenarios
The Directors believe the base case scenario above is reasonable and appropriate. The potential impact of increasing inflationary costs and interest rates are inbuilt
and the base case also considers slower recovery in the Asia Pacific portfolio from international tourism.

In addition to the wide range of factors already considered in the base case, the Directors have prepared a downside scenario considering other severe but plausible
events. Examples include events leading to extended attraction closures occurring due to:

- Ride safety incidents;

- Severe weather incidents; and

- Security related incidents including acts of terrorism and/or the impact of the threat of terrorism on consumer behaviours.

The continuing war in Ukraine has been considered but not modelled in the downside scenario. Our trading operations are not directly affected by the war and to
date the Group has not seen any significant impact on performance as a direct consequence of the ongoing conflict.

The diversification of the Group’s attractions helps minimise the risk of serious business interruption potentially caused by the risks considered in the downside
scenario. While not modelled in the downside scenario, there are numerous mitigating actions the Group could take to address both modelled and unmodelled
adverse impacts. These mitigating measures are considered to be realistically available to the Group based on historical experience, enabling us to meet our liabilities
as they fall due should this situation arise. Within the Group’s control, significant cost cutting measures could be implemented across operations and the Group
could delay uncommitted capital expenditure. This ability to manage the cost base and rephase or defer capital investment provides reasonable protection to the
Group in the face of macro events or uncertainty not in the Group’s control. While not in the direct control of the Group, we could also seek to further extend the
waiver to financial covenants on its borrowing facilities, renew/replace existing facilities and/or raise further finance through cash injections from the consortium of
investors in the Company. Given the Group’s history of cash generation and the successful issue of debt securities including during the COVID-19 pandemic, we
would expect to be able to raise such funds as required. However, there is no guarantee that such funds will be available.

In the modelled downside scenario, and not taking into account the impact of any mitigation measures, the Group’s currently available liquidity would remain positive,
albeit reduced, throughout the going concern assessment period. Consistent with the base case, under this scenario there would be no breach of lending facilities
considering the terms of the covenant calculations, with leverage remaining within the required limits throughout.

Stress testing has been performed to model scenarios which would cause a liquidity shortfall or covenant breach within the going concern assessment period. These
scenarios have been assessed and have been deemed remote. Our assessment indicates that the Group would still have sufficient funds to enable it to operate within
its available facilities and settle its liabilities as they fall due through the going concern assessment period.

Conclusion
Considering the Group and Company’s statement of financial position, available facilities, cash flow forecasts and the above modelled base case and downside
scenarios, financial projections indicate that the Group will have sufficient funds and resources to continue in operational existence, operate within its available
facilities and settle its liabilities as they fall due over the going concern assessment period. Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in
preparing its consolidated Group and Company financial statements.

# SECTION 1

#### CONTINUED
# BASIS OF PREPARATION

53 weeks ended 31 December 2022 (2021: 52 weeks ended 25 December 2021)

**1.1** **BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)**

**Basis of consolidation**
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Motion JVco Limited and its subsidiaries at the end of each reporting period (see note 6.6)
and include its share of its joint ventures’ results using the equity method.

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns through its involvement with
the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated
financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.

All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated.

Whilst the Group operates in the hyperinflationary jurisdiction of Turkey, the operations are immaterial and as a result the application of IAS 29 ‘Financial Reporting
in Hyperinflationary Economies’ has not had a material impact to the Group’s consolidated results.

**Foreign currency**
Foreign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the
settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying net investment hedges.

The results and financial position of those Group companies that do not have a Sterling functional currency are translated into Sterling as follows:

- Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the end of the reporting period.

- Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period.

- All resulting exchange differences are recognised in equity in the translation reserve.

The reporting date foreign exchange rates by major currency are provided in note 5.3.

**Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group**
Financial instruments are recognised on the statement of financial position when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The
accounting policy for each type of financial instrument is included within the relevant notes.

Financial assets are initially measured at fair value, unless otherwise noted, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive
income or fair value through profit or loss. A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or the Group
transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.

Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, plus, in the case of other financial liabilities, directly attributable transaction costs. Other financial liabilities,
primarily the Group’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost. Financial liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss and
are held on the statement of financial position at fair value. A financial liability is derecognised when the Group’s obligations are discharged, expire or are cancelled.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are accounted for as part of finance costs.

An equity instrument is any contract that has a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Finance payments associated with
financial instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity. The preference shares issued by the Company carry a fixed,
cumulative, preferential dividend which accrues (but is not payable) on each preference share on a daily basis from the date of issue of the relevant preference share.
Payment of these dividends is at the discretion of the Company and accordingly they have been classified as equity.

Where financial instruments consist of a combination of debt and equity, the Group will assess the substance of the arrangement in place and decide how to attribute
values to each taking into consideration the policy definitions above.

Further information on equity instruments issued by the Group is set out in note 5.5.

**New standards and interpretations**
A full list of new accounting standards and interpretations that have been implemented in the year, including those which have had no significant impact, can be found
in note 6.4.

# BASIS OF PREPARATION

53 weeks ended 31 December 2022 (2021: 52 weeks ended 25 December 2021)

**1.1** **BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)**

**Judgements and estimates**
The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Management considers the following areas to be the areas that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. They are
explained in more detail in the related notes.

Judgements
Management considers the following areas to be the judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.

- _Useful life of brands (note 4.2) - where significant brands have been recognised as part of an acquisition, they have been assessed as having indefinite useful lives_
and management have considered that this judgement remains appropriate.

- _Goodwill impairment reviews (note 4.3) - the level at which goodwill is initially allocated and thereafter monitored._

- _Lease obligations (note 5.4) - IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ defines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease together with the options to extend or terminate a_
lease, if the lessee were reasonably certain to exercise that option. Where a lease includes the option for the Group to extend the lease term, the Group makes
a judgement at the reporting date as to whether it is reasonably certain that the option will be taken.

Estimates
The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements also includes the use of estimates and assumptions. Management considers the following to be the
area which includes the use of estimates and assumptions and which could have a significant risk of a material change to the carrying value of assets and liabilities
within the next year:

- _Valuation of LEGOLAND Parks (LLP) and Resort Theme Parks (RTP) Operating Groups’ assets and impairment (note 4.3) - the estimation of future cash flows together_
with the discount rates adopted when calculating the value in use of assets.

The consolidated financial statements also include other areas of judgement and accounting estimates. Management considers the following to be areas where the
recognition and measurement of certain assets and liabilities are based on assumptions and/or are subject to longer term uncertainties, but that do not meet the
definition under IAS 1 of significant accounting estimates or critical accounting judgements:

- _Taxation (note 2.4) - recognition of deferred tax balances and accounting for tax risks._

- _Valuation of Midway Attractions Operating Group assets and impairment (note 4.3) - the estimation of future cash flows together with the discount rates adopted_
when calculating the value in use of assets.

- _Provisions (note 4.5) - estimated outflow to settle the obligations and, where relevant, the appropriate discount and inflation rates to apply._

- _Interest-bearing loans and borrowings (note 5.2) - expected period of borrowings when calculating the effective interest rate on those borrowings._

- _Share-based payments (note 5.6) - the implied enterprise value of Motion Topco Limited was calculated as at the reporting date in order to calculate share-based_
payment valuations for the three schemes. The valuation was performed using the Monte Carlo option pricing model, the inputs to which involve estimation
uncertainty; these inputs are set out in note 5.6. Future valuation fluctuations could materially impact share-based payment expenses recognised in
subsequent periods.

- _Share-based payments (note 5.6) - using the Group’s approved five year business plan and considering ongoing future strategies of both the Group and the Group’s_
shareholders, the most likely vesting period for each scheme has been estimated, with the maximum length of award expected to be nine years.

- _Employee benefits (note 6.2) - assumed discount rate, inflation rate and mortality when valuing defined benefit liabilities._

**Segmental information**
An operating segment, as defined by IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’, is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues
and incur expenses. The Group is managed through its three Operating Groups, which form the operating segments on which the information shown below is
prepared. The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is provided internally to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), who is
the Group’s chief operating decision maker, and the Board. An operating segment’s operating results are reviewed regularly by the CEO to make decisions about
resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance.

**Revenue**
Revenue represents the amounts received (excluding VAT and similar taxes) in the areas set out below and which have been disaggregated in the segmental
information presented above. When accounting for revenue, an assessment is made, considering the control principles of IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with
Customers’, as to whether parties involved in providing goods or services to a customer are acting as a principal (if they control delivery to the customer) or, if they
are arranging for those goods or services to be provided by the other party, as an agent. Where Merlin has outsourced the delivery of the service, for example such
as in food and beverage operations, the Group accounts for these as an agent.

- _Visitor revenue - represents admissions tickets, retail, food and beverage sales and other commercial offerings such as photos and games experiences inside an_
attraction. Tickets and other services can be bought in advance, generally online, in which case they are held in deferred revenue and recognised when the visitor
uses those tickets or services, or the validity period expires. Revenue from annual passes and other tickets that entitle a customer to continued visits over a
period of time is deferred and then recognised over the period that the pass is valid. Retail and food and beverage revenue, along with other similar commercial
offerings, is recognised at point of sale.

- _Accommodation revenue - represents overnight stay and conference room revenue along with food and beverage revenue earned within our hotels and other_
accommodation offerings. Accommodation revenue is recognised at the time when a customer stays at the accommodation.

- _Other revenue - represents sponsorship, function, management and development contract revenue along with other sundry items. Sponsorship revenue is_
recognised over the relevant contract term. Function revenue is recognised at the time of the event. Management contract revenue is recognised as it is earned.
Where the Group enters into contracts for attraction development, revenue is recognised over time as performance obligations under the contracts are met.

**Cost of sales**
Cost of sales of £359 million (2021: £226 million) represents variable expenses (excluding VAT and similar taxes) incurred from revenue generating activities. Retail
inventory, food and beverage consumables and costs associated with the delivery of accommodation are the principal expenses included within this category.

The total charge for the year for share-based payments for 2021 was less than £1 million. Further details are provided in note 5.6.

The Group has accessed government support measures in the geographies in which it operates, including employee furlough schemes. This funding meets the
definition of a government grant and the income recognised in the year in relation to these furlough schemes was £2 million (2021: £19 million).

Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the Group has complied with the relevant conditions within the agreement and that the
grant will be received. For each grant, the Group assesses whether it relates to either capital or operational expenditure incurred. A grant relating to expenses
already incurred is recognised in the period in which it becomes receivable, offsetting the expenses the grants are intended to compensate. The funding received is
included within the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

Directors’ remuneration
Directors’ remuneration for the year was £0.3 million, being the remuneration of the highest paid Director (2021: £0.3 million). There were no Company pension
contributions payable.

Related party transactions with key management personnel
The remuneration of key management, comprising the members of the Executive Committee, was as follows:

**2.3** **FINANCE INCOME AND COSTS**

**Accounting policies**
Income and costs
Finance income comprises interest income from financial assets and investments, applicable foreign exchange gains and gains on hedging instruments that are
recognised in the income statement. Finance costs comprise interest expense, finance charges on finance leases, applicable foreign exchange losses and losses
on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement. Interest income and interest expense are recognised as they accrue, using the effective
interest method.

Capitalisation of borrowing costs
Where assets take a substantial time to complete, the Group capitalises borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of
those assets.

**2.4** **TAXATION**

**Accounting policies**
The tax charge for the year is recognised in the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income, according to the accounting treatment of the related
transaction. The tax charge comprises both current and deferred tax.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable income, using tax rates substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax
payable in respect of previous periods.

Deferred tax is provided on certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and taxation purposes
respectively. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither
accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent that they will
probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount
of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.

Subject to the exceptions noted above, deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and any unused
tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and
the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised. This assessment is made after considering a number of factors, including the Group’s
future trading expectations.

Provisions for uncertain tax positions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and management judge that it is probable that
there will be a future outflow of economic benefits to settle that obligation. Uncertain tax positions are assessed and measured on an issue by issue basis within the
jurisdictions that we operate using management’s estimate of the most likely outcome. A combination of in-house tax experts, previous experience and professional firms
is used when assessing uncertain tax positions.

**Total tax expense in income statement** 34.6% 47 (48.9%) 46

The reported effective tax rate (ETR) is 34.6%. The difference between the underlying ETR (excluding exceptionals) of 30.8% and the UK standard tax rate of 19.0% is
primarily attributable to the effect of tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain non-deductible expenditure offset by movements in uncertain tax provisions. During the
course of the year, the conclusion of tax authority enquiries has enabled certain provisions to be released or reassessed.

In 2021, the difference between the reported ETR of (48.9)% and the UK standard tax rate was primarily attributable to the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities due to
the change in the UK tax rate from 19% to 25% from 1 April 2023, and the non-recognition of tax losses.

Significant factors impacting the Group’s future ETR include the Group’s geographic mix of profits, the timing of recognition of tax losses and changes to local or
international tax laws. Unrecognised deferred tax assets include tax losses in various jurisdictions which may be recognised in future periods as the relevant business
becomes profitable. In the 3 March 2021 Budget it was announced that the UK tax rate will increase to 25% from 1 April 2023. This will have a consequential effect on the
Group’s future tax charge.

In April 2019 the European Commission (EC) announced its final decision that certain elements of the UK’s Controlled Foreign Company rules partially represent State
Aid and in February 2021, the Group received charging notices from HMRC for £28 million, which have been paid. The UK Government made an annulment application
against the EC decision, however in June 2022 the EU General Court dismissed the UK’s application. The UK has subsequently lodged an appeal to the Court of Justice of
the European Union. The Group expects the appeal will ultimately be successful and accordingly the payments are held as a receivable in non-current assets. If the appeal
is ultimately unsuccessful then this could result in an increase in the Group’s future effective tax rate.

# SECTION 3 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

53 weeks ended 31 December 2022 (2021: 52 weeks ended 25 December 2021)

**3.1** **BUSINESS COMBINATIONS**

**Accounting policies**
When a business combination takes place, the Directors consider the rights and intentions of the directors of both entities and the overall controlling parties before
and after acquisition to determine who the acquiring party is, and then account for business combinations by applying the purchase method. Having determined the
acquiring party, any individually identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired are valued. These include the property, plant and equipment and any
intangible assets which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable, with any remaining balance being
assigned to goodwill.

**2022**
The COEX Aquarium
In April the Group completed the acquisition of the COEX Aquarium in Seoul, South Korea. The Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Seoul Ocean
Aquarium Co., Ltd. for £31 million, net of cash acquired. This acquisition added a further significant attraction to the SEA LIFE portfolio.

Cadbury World
In January 2022 the Group entered into an agreement to take over the operations of the Cadbury World attraction in the UK. The transaction completed in

 AND LIABILITIES

53 weeks ended 31 December 2022 (2021: 52 weeks ended 25 December 2021)

**4.1** **PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT**

**Accounting policies**
Property, plant and equipment (PPE) are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Where components of an item of PPE have different useful lives, they are accounted for separately.

The initial cost of PPE includes all costs incurred in bringing the asset into use and includes external costs for the acquisition, construction and commissioning of the
asset, internal project costs (primarily staff expenses) and capitalised borrowing costs.

Assets acquired through business combinations
At the time of a business combination PPE is separately recognised and valued. Given the specialised nature of the PPE acquired, fair values are calculated on a
depreciated replacement cost basis. The key estimates are the replacement cost, where industry specific indices are used to restate original historic cost; and
depreciation, where the total and remaining economic useful lives are considered, together with the residual value of each asset. The total estimated lives applied
are consistent with those set out below. Residual values are based on industry specific indices. Freehold land is valued using a market approach.

New sites
Capital expenditure on new attractions includes all the costs of bringing the items of PPE within that attraction into use ready for the opening of the attraction.
Pre-opening costs are only capitalised to the extent they are required to bring PPE into its working condition. Other pre-opening costs are expensed as incurred.

Existing sites
Subsequent expenditure on items of PPE in our existing estate can be broadly split into two categories:

- Capital expenditure which adds new items of PPE to an attraction, or which extends the operational life, or enhances existing items of PPE is accounted for as
an addition to PPE. Examples of such expenditure include new rides or displays and enhancements to rides or displays, which increase the appeal of our
attractions to visitors.

- Expenditure which is incurred to maintain the items of PPE in a safe and useable state and to maintain the useful life of items of PPE is charged to the income
statement as incurred. Examples of such expenditure include regular servicing and maintenance of buildings, rides and displays and ongoing repairs to items
of PPE.

Government grants
Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the Group has complied with the relevant conditions within the agreement and that the
grant will be received. For each grant, the Group assesses whether it relates to either capital or operational expenditure incurred. The Group has elected to
deduct grants related to capital expenditure from the total project costs within property, plant and equipment and amortise them systematically over the useful life
of the assets.

Depreciation
Land is not depreciated. Assets under construction are not depreciated until they come into use, when they are transferred to buildings or plant and equipment as
appropriate. Depreciation is then charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of PPE. Asset lives
for plant and equipment vary depending on the nature of the asset, from short life assets such as IT assets, up to long term infrastructure assets. No residual values
are typically considered.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

Asset class Depreciation policy


Freehold/long leasehold buildings 50 years

Leasehold buildings 20 – 50 years (dependent on life of lease)

Plant and equipment 5 – 30 years

Depreciation is calculated in line with the policy stated previously.

During the year the Group reviews useful economic lives and tests PPE for impairment in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy, as referred to in note 4.3.
Impairment charges have been made in the year of £19 million (2021: £nil), in respect of two of the Group’s Midway attractions, arising from a review of market and
economic conditions at those locations where the carrying value exceeded the recoverable amount. No reasonable change in the assumptions would materially
change the impairments recognised.

One attraction within the Group’s LEGOLAND Parks Operating Group is sensitive to changes in assumptions, where an increase of 45 basis points in the pre-tax
discount rate would absorb the headroom of £25 million.

**4.1** **PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (CONTINUED)**

**Capital commitments**
At the year end the Group had a number of outstanding capital commitments in respect of capital expenditure at its existing attractions (including accommodation),
as well as for Midway attractions that are under construction. These commitments are expected to be settled within two financial years of the reporting date. These
amount to £62 million (2021: £70 million) for which no provision has been made.

**4.2** **GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS**

**Accounting policies**
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of an acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired less any contingent liabilities
assumed. Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-generating units and is not amortised but is
tested annually for impairment. In respect of joint ventures, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the joint venture.

Where they arise on acquisition, brands are valued using the excess earnings method. All the significant brands acquired are assessed as having indefinite useful
economic lives. This assessment is based upon the strong historical performance of the brands over a number of economic cycles, the ability to roll out the brands,
and the Directors’ intentions regarding the future use of brands. The Directors feel this is a suitable policy for a brands business which invests in and maintains the
brands, and foresee no technological developments or competitor actions which would put a finite life on the brands. The brands are tested annually for impairment.
Other brands are amortised over a period of fifteen years.

Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.

Other intangible assets comprise software licences deemed to be controlled by the Group, sponsorship rights and other contract or relationship based intangible
assets. They are amortised on a straight-line basis from the date they are available for use. They are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and
impairment losses.

The estimated useful lives of other intangible assets are as follows:

Asset class Estimated useful life


Licences Life of licence (up to 15 years)

Other intangible assets Relevant contractual period (up to 30 years)

**4.3** **IMPAIRMENT TESTING**

**Accounting policies**
The carrying amount of the Group’s goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis. Intangible assets, PPE and right-of-use (ROU) assets are reviewed at the end of each
reporting period to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists or if the asset has an indefinite life, the asset’s recoverable
amount is estimated.

The process of impairment testing is to estimate the recoverable amount of the assets concerned, and recognise an impairment loss whenever the carrying amount
of those assets exceeds the recoverable amount. Impairment testing is performed first at the individual cash-generating unit (CGU) level without goodwill, with any
impairment loss recognised as required. Impairment testing for goodwill is then applied to the collection of CGUs to which the goodwill relates.

The level at which the assets concerned are reviewed varies as follows:

Asset


Goodwill Goodwill is reviewed at an Operating Group level, being the relevant grouping of CGUs at which the benefit of such goodwill arises. A
CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates largely independent cash inflows, being the Group’s individual attractions.

Brands Brands are reviewed at an individual CGU level.

PPE PPE is reviewed at an individual CGU level, being the Group's individual attractions.

ROU assets ROU assets are reviewed at an individual CGU level, being the Group's individual attractions. In doing so, the associated lease liability is
considered against the value of the ROU asset as a sale of a CGU would necessitate that a buyer takes on the lease liability.

For assets that are in continuing use but do not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which the
assets belong.

Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill, and then to reduce the carrying
amount of other intangible assets and other assets on a pro rata basis.

**Calculation of recoverable amount**
In accordance with accounting standards the recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. To assess value in use,
estimated future cash flows have been discounted to their present value using pre-tax discount rates, each appropriate to the Operating Group concerned. The
Group’s internally approved five year business plans, where the first year is based on latest budgets, are used as the basis for these calculations, with cash flows
beyond the five year outlook period then extrapolated using long term growth rates.

The key assumptions and estimates used when calculating the net present value of future cash flows from the Group’s businesses are as follows:

Estimate


Future cash flows Assumed to be equivalent to the operating cash flows of the businesses less the cash flows in respect of capital expenditure
and repayments of lease liabilities. The Group uses EBITDA less an allocation of central costs, in line with other recharges
which occur in the business, as a proxy for the operating cash flows of its attractions as they are not significantly impacted
by movements in working capital.

Growth in EBITDA EBITDA is forecast by an analysis of both projected revenues and costs. Visitor numbers and revenue projections are
based on market analysis, including the total available market, historic trends, competition and site development activity,
both in terms of capital expenditure on rides and attractions as well as marketing activity.

Projections of operating costs are based on historical data, adjusted for variations in visitor numbers and planned expansion
of site activities as well as general market conditions.


Timing and quantum of future
capital and maintenance
expenditure


Projections are based on the attractions’ long term development plans, taking into account the capital investment necessary
to maintain and sustain the performance of the attractions’ assets.


Long term growth rate A growth rate of 2.5% (2021: 2.5%) was determined based on management’s long term expectations, taking account of
historical averages and future expected trends in both market development and market share growth.

**4.3** **IMPAIRMENT TESTING (CONTINUED)**

Estimate


Discount rates to reflect the risks
involved


Based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital of a ‘market participant’ within the main geographical regions
where the Group operates, these are drawn from market data and businesses in similar sectors, and adjusted for asset
specific risks. The key assumptions of the ‘market participant’ include the ratio of debt to equity financing, risk free rates
and the medium term risks associated with equity investments. Average figures are used where appropriate to reduce the
impact of any short term volatility. Net present values are calculated using pre-tax discount rates derived from this posttax weighted average cost of capital.


**Sensitivity analysis**
Impairment reviews are often sensitive to changes in key assumptions. Sensitivity analysis has therefore been performed on the calculated recoverable amounts
considering incremental changes in the key assumptions.

Particular focus is given to material amounts where headroom is more limited. This relates to goodwill attributed to the LEGOLAND Parks Operating Group, where
the headroom is £550 million (2021: £87 million) and the Resort Theme Parks Operating Group where the headroom is £173 million (2021: £22 million). The Midway
Attractions Operating Group and the individual brands show considerable headroom and are not sensitive to even significant changes in any of the key assumptions.

In undertaking sensitivity analysis consideration has been given to movements in forecast EBITDA, increases in discount rates and reductions in long term
growth rates:

- At the reporting date the Directors consider that the forecasts used reflect the best estimate of future trading. It is noted, however, that the calculations are
inherently sensitive to the level of growth which can depend on a number of factors. While in the short term slower growth would be highly unlikely to affect
valuations by a substantial amount, longer term shortfalls that affect the outlook for the fifth year of the plan (which drives the terminal value) would have a
more significant impact.

- Discount rates have been derived from market data. As these rates are intended to be long term in nature they are expected to be reasonably stable in the short
term, however market discount rates could increase in future.

- The long term growth rate, which is applied to the cash flows of the final year in the business plan (2027), was determined based on management’s long term
expectations, taking account of historical averages and future expected trends in both market development and market share growth.

LEGOLAND Parks (LLP)

- If EBITDA for LLP as a whole was forecast to be 14% lower than currently anticipated for 2027, headroom would be absorbed in full.

- If the pre-tax discount rate used across LLP had been higher by a factor of 13% to 12.1%, headroom would have been absorbed in full.

- If circumstances caused the long term growth rate to lower from 2.5% to 0.7%, headroom would be absorbed in full.

Resort Theme Parks (RTP)

- If EBITDA for RTP as a whole was forecast to be 11% lower than currently anticipated for 2027, headroom would be absorbed in full.

- If the pre-tax discount rate used across RTP had been higher by a factor of 15% to 12.6%, headroom would have been absorbed in full.

- If circumstances caused the long term growth rate to lower from 2.5% to 0.2%, headroom would be absorbed in full.

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is measured using the first-in first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in
acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their present location and condition. In a business combination the goods for resale held by the acquired Group are
‘stepped-up’ to a value that takes into account an estimation of the level of future sales proceeds to be generated by the acquiring Group, less estimated costs
necessary to sell the inventory.

Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised and carried at the original invoice amount less a loss allowance calculated using the simplified expected credit loss (ECL)
model approach. Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Other receivables are stated at their amortised cost less any
impairment losses. Estimated ECLs are calculated using both actual credit loss experience and forward looking projections.

Certain attractions operate on leasehold sites and these provisions relate to the anticipated costs of removing assets and restoring the sites concerned at the end of
the lease term. These leases are typically of a duration of between 10 and 60 years.

They are established on inception and reviewed annually. The provisions are discounted back to present value with the discount then being unwound through the
income statement as part of finance costs. The cost of establishing these provisions together with the impact of any changes in the discount rate is capitalised within
the cost of the related asset.

Other
Other provisions include future regulatory payments in connection with the modification of the UK Resort Theme Parks leases and agreements that were entered
into to secure their tenure until 2077 (see note 5.4) that may become payable at the start of the additional 35 year period. Remaining balances relate to the
estimated cost arising from open insurance claims, tax matters and legal issues.

There are no anticipated future events that would be expected to cause a material change in the timing or amount of outflows associated with the provisions.

**5.2** **INTEREST-BEARING LOANS AND BORROWINGS**

**Accounting policy**
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less attributable fees. These fees are then amortised through the income statement on an
effective interest rate basis over the expected life of the loan (or over the contractual term where there is no clear indication that a shorter life is appropriate). If the
Group’s estimate of the expected life based on repayment subsequently changes, the resulting adjustment to the effective interest rate calculation is recognised as a
gain or loss on re-measurement and presented separately in the income statement, in accordance with IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’.

Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs and are subsequently stated at amortised cost. Any difference
between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is amortised through the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the
effective interest method.

At 31 December 2022, the Group’s senior facilities are the following:

Senior secured debt

- €1,460 million and $1,342 million drawn facilities to mature in November 2026 entered into by the Company’s subsidiary Motion Finco S.à r.l. The margins on
these facilities are dependent on the Group’s adjusted leverage ratio and at 31 December 2022 were at a margin of 3.0% (2021: 3.0%) for EUR borrowings and
3.25% (2021: 3.25%) for USD borrowings over the floating interest rates when drawn. The relevant floating interest rates are USD LIBOR, which was 4.73% at
31 December 2022 (0.13% at 25 December 2021), and EURIBOR, which was 2.20% at 31 December 2022 (nil% at 25 December 2021).

- €500 million of 7.0% senior secured notes due 2025 entered into by the Company’s subsidiary Motion Finco S.à r.l. The notes are listed on The International
Stock Exchange.

- $400 million 5.75% senior notes due 2026 entered into by the Company’s subsidiary Merlin Entertainments Limited. The notes are listed on The International
Stock Exchange.

- A £400 million revolving credit facility to mature in May 2026. £30 million was utilised by way of establishing certain ancillary facilities, including letters of credit.
The relevant floating rate used for the facility was amended on 1 January 2022 from GBP LIBOR to the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA).

Other senior debt

- €370 million 4.5% senior notes due 2027 and $410 million 6.625% senior notes due 2027 entered into by the Company’s subsidiary Motion Bondco DAC. The
notes are listed on The International Stock Exchange.

The terms of the floating rate debt facility require a repayment of 0.25% of the outstanding principal amount of the USD borrowings every three months.

Other loans of £1 million (2021: £3 million) have been taken out in respect of specific capital projects.

Covenants
A financial covenant has existed from 30 September 2020 but is only required when the revolving credit facility is drawn by 40% or more (net of cash and cash
equivalents). The covenant requires the Group to maintain adjusted consolidated senior secured leverage below 10x.

Effective June 2021, the Group agreed with its revolving facility lenders to waive the leverage covenant until Q3 2023. As part of this agreement the Group is
required to maintain a minimum liquidity of £75 million (to include amounts undrawn from the revolving credit facility, and cash and cash equivalents), over the
period of the waiver.

The Group complied with the financial covenants in the year. The Group is also required to comply with certain non-financial covenants in these bank facilities and
notes, and these requirements were satisfied throughout the year.

**5.3** **FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT**

**Liquidity risk**
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group would not have sufficient funds to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s Treasury department produces
short term and long term cash forecasts to identify liquidity requirements and headroom, which are reviewed by the Group’s Chief Financial Officer. Surplus cash is
actively managed across Group bank accounts to cover local shortfalls or invested in bank deposits or other short term liquid investments such as money market
funds. In some countries bank cash pooling arrangements are in place to optimise the use of cash. As at 31 December 2022 the Group had £266 million of cash and
cash equivalents (2021: £185 million) and access to a £400 million revolving credit facility, of which £30 million was utilised in 2022 (2021: £28 million) by way of
establishing certain ancillary facilities, including letters of credit, in order to meet its obligations and commitments that will fall due.

The following table sets out the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments. This analysis assumes that interest rates prevailing at the

**Interest rate risk**
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on both interest-bearing assets and liabilities. The Group has a policy of actively managing its interest rate risk exposure
using a combination of fixed rate debt, interest rate swaps, and interest rate caps.

At 31 December 2022 the Group had £1,441 million of fixed rate debt comprising:

- €500 million of 7.0% notes to mature in 2025;

- $400 million of 5.75% notes to mature in 2026;

- €370 million 4.5% notes to mature in 2027; and

- $410 million 6.625% notes to mature in 2027.

If required, to achieve the desired balance of fixed and floating interest rates across currencies, the Group may use floating to fixed interest rate swaps and caps
(which are part of cash flow hedging relationships) and fixed to floating interest rate swaps and caps (which are part of fair value hedging relationships).

In 2022, the Group entered into hedging arrangements on USD 600 million of floating rate USD debt to swap the floating interest rate to a fixed rate and on
EUR 700 million of floating rate EUR debt to cap the floating interest rate to a capped rate on the drawn floating rate facilities.

In aggregate, at the end of the reporting period, 67% (2021: 37%) of the Group’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings is at a fixed/capped rate for a weighted
average period of 4 years (2021: 5 years). At 31 December 2022 the fair value of interest rate derivative assets was £39 million (2021: £nil). These interest rate
derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.

Interest rate swaps and caps are recognised at fair value which is determined by reference to market rates. The fair value is the estimated amount that the Group
would receive or pay to exit the instrument, taking into account current interest rates, credit risks and bid/ask spreads. Following initial recognition, changes in fair
value are recognised immediately in profit or loss, except where the Group adopts hedge accounting.

When hedge accounting, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items. It makes an assessment, at inception
and on an ongoing basis, as to whether the hedging instruments are expected to be ‘highly effective’ in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the
respective hedged items during the life of the hedge.

Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in
the cash flow hedge reserve in equity. Any ineffective portion of changes in fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Cumulative gains and losses would
remain in equity until either the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, or until the hedged transaction occurs, at which point they will be reclassified to
profit or loss.

Fair value changes in interest rate caps attributable to changes in the intrinsic value are accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve, and reclassified from the cash
flow hedge reserve to the income statement as a reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged future cash flows affect profit or
loss. Changes in the time value of interest rate caps are accumulated in the cost of hedging reserve and recycled to the income statement on a systematic basis over
the life of the instrument.

53 weeks ended 31 December 2022 (2021: 52 weeks ended 25 December 2021)

**5.3** **FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)**

Sensitivity analysis
Based on the net debt position as at 31 December 2022 a 100 basis points rise in market interest rates would result in an increase in net interest paid of £10 million
_(2021: £14 million) and a 100 basis points fall in market interest rates would result in a decrease in net interest paid of £14 million (2021: increase of £1 million). This_
has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the Group’s variable rate cash, borrowings and derivatives.

**Foreign currency risk**
As the Group operates internationally, the performance of the business is sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s potential currency
exposures comprise transaction and translation exposures. The Group ensures that its net exposure to foreign currency balances is kept to a minimal level by using
foreign currency swaps to exchange balances back into Sterling or by buying and selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary. The fair value of foreign
exchange contracts is the present value of future cash flows and is determined by reference to market rates. At 31 December 2022 the fair value of foreign currency
swap assets was £5 million (2021: £1 million) and of foreign currency swap liabilities was £7 million (2021: £3 million), none of which are hedge accounted.

Transaction exposures
The revenue and costs of the Group’s operations are denominated primarily in the currencies of the relevant local territories. Any significant cross-border trading
exposures would be hedged by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.

Translation exposures
The Group’s results, as presented in Sterling, are subject to fluctuations as a result of exchange rate movements. The Group does not hedge this translation
exposure to its earnings but, where material, may carry out net asset hedging by borrowing in the same currencies as the currencies of its operating units or by using
forward foreign exchange contracts. The Group’s debt facilities (excluding lease liabilities) are therefore denominated in Euros, US Dollars and Sterling and at
31 December 2022 the amounts drawn consisted of €2,330 million and $2,152 million. There are forward foreign exchange contracts in place in respect of
JPY 16,065 million (2021: JPY 14,900 million).

Gains or losses arise on the retranslation of the net assets of foreign operations at different reporting dates and are recognised within the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income. They will predominantly relate to the retranslation of opening net assets at closing foreign exchange rates, together with the retranslation of
retained foreign profits for the year (that have been accounted for in the consolidated income statement at average rates) at closing rates. Exchange rates for major
currencies are set out below.

Gains or losses also arise on the retranslation of foreign currency denominated borrowings designated as effective net investment hedges of overseas net assets.
These are offset in equity by corresponding gains or losses arising on the retranslation of the related hedged foreign currency net assets. The Group also treats
specific intercompany loan balances, which are not intended to be repaid in the foreseeable future, as part of its net investment. In the event of a foreign entity being
sold or a hedging item being extinguished, such exchange differences would be recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.

The following exchange rates have been used in the translation of the results of foreign operations:

Sensitivity analysis on foreign currency risk
A 10% strengthening of all currencies against Sterling would increase net debt by £383 million (2021: £359 million). As described above, gains or losses in the income
statement and equity are offset by the retranslation of the related foreign currency net assets or specific intercompany loan balances.

A 10% strengthening of all currencies against Sterling would reduce the fair value of foreign exchange contracts and result in a charge to the income statement of
£5 million (2021: £13 million).

**Credit risk**
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. Credit risk is
limited to the carrying value of the Group’s monetary assets. The Group has limited credit risk with its customers, the vast majority of whom pay in advance or at
the time of their visit. There are credit policies in place with regard to its trade receivables with credit evaluations performed on customers requiring credit over a
certain amount.

The Group manages credit exposures in connection with financing and treasury activities including exposures arising from bank deposits, cash held at banks and
derivative transactions, by appraisal, formal approval and ongoing monitoring of the credit position of counterparties. Counterparty exposures are measured against a
formal transaction limit appropriate to that counterparty’s credit position. The Group robustly appraises investments before they are made to ensure the associated
credit risk is acceptable. Performance of investments are closely monitored, in some cases through Board participation, to ensure returns are in line with
expectations and credit risk remains acceptable. There were no overdue amounts in respect of investments and no impairments have been recorded (2021: £nil).

**5.4** **LEASE OBLIGATIONS**

**Accounting policy**
Where a contract provides the right to control the use of an asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration, the contract is accounted for as a lease. In
order for lease accounting to apply, an assessment is made at the inception of the contract that considers whether:

- the Group has the use of an identified asset, which entitles it to the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits that arise from the use of the
asset; and

- the right to direct the use of the asset, either through the right to operate the asset or by predetermining how the asset is used.

Measurement at lease inception
At the lease commencement date the Group, as the lessee, will recognise:

- a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments, and:

- an asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset (ROU asset).

The lease liability is initially measured as the present value of future lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, or if not available an
incremental borrowing rate. Future lease payments will include fixed payments, variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate (initially measured at the
rate at the commencement date, and subsequently modified as subsequent index or rates changes occur) and amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under
residual value guarantees. In relation to variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, the total lease liability recognised in the statement of financial
position includes the impact of any index or rate changes that have already occurred, but does not include the impact of any future index or rate changes that have
not yet taken place.

The ROU asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the amount initially recognised as the lease liability, lease payments made at or before the
commencement date less any lease incentives received, initial direct costs incurred, and the estimated costs to be incurred at the end of the lease to restore the site
to the required condition stipulated in the lease.

In a business combination the ROU assets and lease liabilities for those leases accounted for under IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ are aligned, except where it is assessed that the
cost of the acquired historic lease commitments taken on are greater or lower than a market participant would expect to pay were equivalent leases being entered
into at the time of the transaction. Where a current market rental is estimated to be higher than that currently paid by the acquired Group, there is an upward
adjustment to the right-of-use asset, or vice-versa if the opposite applies.

On inception of a lease for a new site, where required, the estimated cost of decommissioning any additions is included within ROU assets and depreciated over
the lease term. A corresponding provision is set up as disclosed in note 4.5.

Depreciation (and any subsequent impairment) on the ROU asset, interest on the lease liability and any variable lease payments are all recognised in the
income statement.

Ongoing measurement
After the commencement date the Group measures the ROU asset using a cost model, reducing the cost through depreciation and any impairment losses.
Adjustments will be made to the ROU asset to reflect the changes in the lease liability as a result of changes to lease payments or modifications to the lease.

The lease liability is adjusted for interest on the liability, contractual lease repayments and any reassessment of the lease as a result of a contract modification, such as
changes to the contractual rent amounts, or changes to the term of the lease.

Upon lease modification, the discount rates used in the present value calculations are adjusted to reflect the appropriate rates at the date of modification for the
remaining term of the lease, with resulting adjustments to the liability and ROU asset balances. Discount rates are then not revisited during the remaining life of
the lease.

When a lease is terminated earlier than the contractual end date within the lease agreement, the remaining balances on the lease liability after any final payments due,
the ROU asset gross cost and the ROU asset accumulated depreciation are removed. Any difference between the liability balance removed and the net ROU asset
balance removed are reflected in the income statement.

Short term and low-value leases
The Group has taken the recognition exemptions for short term leases and leases of low-value items. Leases which fall within the Group’s defined parameters for
these exemptions are excluded from the IFRS 16 lease accounting requirements and are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

**5.4** **LEASE OBLIGATIONS (CONTINUED)**

Rent reductions and deferrals
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued amendments to IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ to allow lessees not to
account for rent concessions as lease modifications if they are a direct consequence of COVID-19 and meet certain conditions. On 31 March 2021 the IASB
extended their amendments to IFRS 16 beyond 30 June 2021. Therefore, as a lessee we have applied the practical expedient for the whole of the financial year and
are not required to assess whether eligible rent concessions are lease modifications. Accordingly, where the Group has agreed concessions in the form of a one-off
reduction in rent, they have been accounted for as a variable lease payment and have been recognised in profit or loss. The total recognised in the income statement
was £1 million (2021: £1 million).

**Lease arrangements**
The Group’s most significant lease arrangements are set out below.

There is a portfolio of leases that relate to the United Kingdom attractions within the Resort Theme Parks Operating Group, and Heide Park Resort in Germany.
Each of these lease agreements was initially for a period of 35 years from inception until 2042, and allowed for annual rent increases based on the inflationary index
in the United Kingdom and fixed increases in Germany. The Group had the option, but was not contractually required, to extend each agreement individually for two
further terms of 35 years, to 2077 and then to 2102, subject to an adjustment to market rates at that time. At the end of 2021 the agreements were modified and
new agreements were entered into to secure tenure for an additional 35 years from 2042 to 2077. The second extension option from 2077 to 2102 still remains
available for the Group to exercise in the future for each site.

For the United Kingdom sites the modification was completed before the end of the 2021 reporting period and the relevant balances were adjusted accordingly in
the 2021 financial statements. The transaction was treated as a lease modification. It did not meet the criteria to be treated as a separate lease. The Group did not
exercise the lease option unilaterally; instead the Group and the lessor entered into a binding agreement to extend the leases in 2042, and agreed certain lease
changes. As part of these changes the United Kingdom sites are now subject to annual rent increases from 2022 linked to CPI +0.5% (with a floor of 1%, and a
maximum increase of 4%). Under the previous agreement the sites were subject to RPI based annual upwards only increases without any maximum. The minimum
1% per annum was reflected in the modification calculation. As part of the transaction the Group received a cash payment of £25 million from the landlord in 2021.
A further £3 million was received in 2023, after the reporting date. The modification and securing of tenure of the UK sites resulted in an increase to the lease
liability of £149 million in 2021.

For the Heide Park Resort, the terms of the modification were agreed and completed at the start of the 2022 reporting period. Under the extension agreement the
park and hotel leases at this site will continue to be subject to fixed annual rent increases, and these have been reflected in the modification calculation. The
extension resulted in a modification to the associated leases, with an increase to the lease liability of £98 million recognised in 2022. As part of the transaction the
Group received a payment of £6 million from the landlord during 2022.

At the time of the acquisition of the Merlin Group by the investor consortium in November 2019, it was determined that the implicit rate of interest for the leases
noted above was not readily determinable, and accordingly an incremental borrowing rate (IBR) was used that reflected the Group’s financing arrangements at that
time. For the modifications above the IBR was calculated by reference to the mid yield on a composite index of debt at an appropriate duration and the same (or
similar) long term credit rating as the Company, adjusted where relevant for the sovereign yield for a similar duration to the index being used in the
country/geography of that index.

LEGOLAND Japan was opened during 2017. The park was developed under an ‘operated and leased’ model whereby a local operating company leases the site and
park infrastructure from a development partner. The development partners are related parties, being KIRKBI Invest A/S and LLJ Investco K.K, a subsidiary of KIRKBI
Invest A/S. KIRKBI Invest A/S holds KIRKBI’s investment as a shareholder of the Group. The lease is for a period of 50 years to 2067. The Group does not have any
right to request the renewal of the lease agreement, however it may be extended subject to agreement of terms with the lessor. For further details see note 6.3.

In addition to the above leases, the Group also enters into other leasing arrangements for sites within the Midway Attractions Operating Group and central areas.
These are typically of a duration between 10 and 60 years, with rent increases determined based on local market practice. In addition to a fixed rental element, rents
within the Midway Attractions Operating Group can also contain a performance related element, typically based on turnover at the site concerned. The key
contractual terms in relation to each lease are considered when calculating the rental charge over the lease term. The potential impact on rent charges of future
performance or increases based on inflationary indices are each excluded from these calculations. Options to renew leases will vary from site to site in line with local
market practice in the territories concerned. Not all of these leases will necessarily have extension options available to them.

On certain leases the Group is required to make variable lease payments in addition to, or instead of, any fixed or minimum rent amounts, usually in the form of rent
based on a percentage of the turnover generated by the relevant attraction. These payments are charged directly to the income statement and do not result in any
adjustment to the lease liabilities or ROU assets as they are contingent on performance. As such there is no future obligation until that performance occurs. As
noted below, the expense relating to these variable lease payments was £23 million in 2022 (2021: £12 million).

There are no significant operating restrictions placed on the Group as a result of its lease arrangements.

**Capital management**
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt and equity. The Group’s objective when managing capital is to: maintain a strong capital base so as to ensure
shareholder and creditor confidence and to sustain future development of the business; to provide returns for shareholders; and to optimise the capital structure to
reduce the cost of capital. There are no externally imposed capital requirements on the Group.

To enable the Group to meet its objective, the Merlin Board monitor returns on capital through constant review of earnings generated from the Group’s capital
investment programme and through regular budgeting and planning processes, manage capital in a manner so as to ensure that sufficient funds for capital investment
and working capital are available, and ensure that the requirements of the Group’s debt covenants are met.

**5.5** **EQUITY AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)**

_Issue of shares_
The nominal value of shares in issue is shown in share capital, with any additional consideration for those shares shown in share premium.

_Ordinary shares_
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time.

Each ordinary share entitles the holder of that ordinary share to receive notice of and to attend and to speak and to vote at general meetings of the Company (on
the basis of one vote per ordinary share), or on any resolution proposed to members as a written resolution. Each ordinary share in the capital of the Company
ranks equally in all respects and no shareholder holds shares carrying special rights relating to the control of the Company.

_Preference shares_
The preference shares earn a fixed, cumulative, preferential dividend at the rate of 6% per annum on the issue price of the preference shares, which accrues (but is
not payable) on each preference share on a daily basis from the date of issue of the relevant preference share, and ends on the day preceding the redemption date,
compounding annually on each anniversary of the compounding date.

The preference shares rank ahead of the ordinary shares for all purposes and no dividend, distribution, return of capital and/or reduction of capital is paid on the
ordinary shares until the preference shares have been redeemed in full.

Each preference share entitles the holder of that preference share to receive notice of and to attend and to speak and to vote at general meetings of the Company
(on the basis of one vote per preference share), or on any resolution proposed to members as a written resolution.

Capital reserve
During 2019, the Group issued £156 million 0% subordinated unsecured shareholder loan notes due 31 October 2020. In accordance with the accounting policy as
set out in note 1.1, these were classed as financial liabilities. Reflecting the off-market interest rate attached to these loan notes, these were initially recognised at
fair value of £150 million with the difference of £6 million treated as a capital contribution. The capital reserve was eliminated through retained earnings in 2021.

Dividends
Dividends are recognised through equity on the earlier of their approval by the Company’s shareholders or their payment. The Directors of the Company have
declared their intention not to pay a dividend for the year ended 31 December 2022 (2021: £nil).

Translation reserve
The translation reserve of £(30) million (2021: £(17) million) comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of
foreign operations. The reporting date foreign exchange rates by major currency are provided in note 5.3.

Cost of hedging reserve
The cost of hedging reserve of £(10) million (2021: £nil) comprises accumulated changes in the time value of interest rate caps.

Cash flow hedge reserve
The cash flow hedge reserve of £38 million (2021: £nil) comprises accumulated changes in the intrinsic value of interest rate caps and the fair value of interest rate
swaps. They are reclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve to the income statement as a reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during which
the hedged future cash flows affect profit or loss.

Reserve for own shares
The Group has made share grants under three employee share incentive plans relating to the Company’s subsidiary Motion TopCo Limited (see note 5.6).
Preference B shares, ordinary B shares and ordinary C shares of the subsidiary were issued to senior management and other employees in exchange for
consideration. The total employee investment is £4,545,262 (2021: £4,362,865) with the nominal value of the shares subscribed for as at the reporting date being
£117,793 (2021: £108,019). Upon the vesting date of the incentive plans, employees will hold a non-controlling interest in Motion TopCo Limited of 0.16% (2021:
_0.16%). Until vesting, Motion TopCo Limited recognises these as treasury shares that result in a reduction to equity; this reduction is eliminated on consolidation._

3,929,200 (2021: 3,650,900) of the shares issued to employees as part of the share incentive plans are held in an employee benefit trust, with a nominal value of
£39,292 (2021: £36,509).

**5.6** **SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS**

**Accounting policy**
The fair value of share plans is recognised as an expense over the expected vesting period with a corresponding entry to either share-based payment liabilities for
cash-settled plans and cash-settled elements relating to compound instruments, or retained earnings for equity-settled plans and equity-settled elements relating to
compound instruments. All entries are net of deferred tax. The fair value of share plans is determined at the date of grant. The fair value of awards granted is
measured based on observable market data, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which awards were granted. For all cash-settled awards and cashsettled elements relating to compound instruments, the fair value is re-measured at each accounting date up to the vesting date by applying an option pricing model.
Non-market based performance conditions (including most likely exit events) are taken into account for all plans in estimating the number of awards likely to vest,
which is reviewed at each accounting date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual awards issued. No adjustment is made
after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or are not exercised.

**Share awards**
The Group operates three employee share incentive plans:

- Senior Management Long Term Bonus plan (LTB)

- Senior Management Equity Investment (EI)

- Management Share Scheme (MSS)

The Group has issued share awards to employees, with all plans being in respect of the Company’s subsidiary entity Motion Topco Limited. Some of these share
awards issued are held in an employee benefit trust (see note 5.5).

Analysis of share-based payment charge
The total charge for the year for all plans is £21 million (2021: less than £1 million), and at the reporting date, liabilities in respect of share-based payment transactions
in the year were £20 million (2021: less than £1 million). The Group has not directly measured the fair value of services received from individuals within the plans in
the year, as it cannot be reliably estimated.

_(1)_ _Weighted average award life / performance conditions – the Group has exercised its judgement to conclude there is sufficient parity between all MSS awards granted to both senior_
_management and other employees to account for all MSS awards in the same manner, and accordingly have concluded that for all awards there is a non-market based performance condition_
_that the awards will vest on the earlier of a defined interim trigger event or exit. Using the Group’s approved five-year business plan and considering ongoing future strategies of both the Group_
_and the Group’s shareholders, the most likely vesting period for each scheme has been estimated, with the maximum length of award expected to be nine years. The blend of compound, cash-_
_settled or equity-settled instruments within each scheme therefore impacts the calculated weighted average award life._

_(2)_ _Comprising 4,823,468 preference B shares and 146,645 ordinary B shares (2021: 4,630,182 preference B shares and 140,769 ordinary B shares)._

_(4)_ _Inclusive of 1,619,225 awards entitling the employee to a cash bonus equivalent in value to a notional number of shares and 6,077,200 allocated shares (2021: 516,500 awards and_
_6,030,900 allocated shares)._

Senior Management Long Term Bonus plan (LTB)
The LTB plan was granted on 11 November 2021 to eligible employees. The designated individuals of the plan are entitled to a gross cash bonus corresponding to a
percentage of the equity value of Motion Topco Limited upon vesting, which is expected to occur upon an interim trigger event. Executive retirements occurring in
the period ended 31 December 2022 have resulted in the reduction of this maximum percentage since the prior year to 0.55%. The cash payment is based on the
value of equity instruments of Motion Topco Limited (there are no equity settlement alternatives) and continuity of service, and hence falls in scope to be
cash-settled.

The fair value of this award is estimated at £14 million following consideration of future uncertainties and the potential volatility of business values, and it could
change in future years should the value of the Group rise over time. As the award is cash-settled, valuations calculating the expected fair value of awards are
reperformed on an annual basis.

Senior Management Equity Investment (EI)
The Senior Management Equity Investment (EI) plan was granted from Motion Topco Limited on 11 November 2021 and 22 July 2022 following eligible employee
investment, resulting in 4,823,468 preference B shares and 146,645 ordinary B shares being issued. The eligible employee investment for the EI plan varies in
comparison to the Management Share Schemes (MSS) as the awards are a different share category (B shares versus ordinary C shares awarded in MSS schemes). The
preference shares carry a right to a discretionary fixed, cumulative preferential dividend, which accrues (but is not payable) on each preference share on a daily basis
from 1 April 2021. Payment of these dividends is at the discretion of the Board of Motion Topco Limited. Accordingly, these awards have been classified as equity
and hence fall under the scope of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’.

There is a put option for cash on up to 100% of the shares at fair market value, exercisable at the expected vesting date, which is the earlier of the interim trigger
event or exit. As the interim trigger event is expected to occur prior to an exit event, this has been used to estimate the vesting period of the plan. The option is
subject to non-market based performance conditions, being exit events which create obligations on the Group, and continuity of employment. Individuals with
continued employment until exit will retain shares to the extent the put option is not exercised; hence, the potential appreciation of value of the EI plan is treated as
a compound instrument.

Management Share Scheme (MSS)
The MSS’s are accounted for as part equity-settled, part cash-settled and part compound instruments. MSS plans were granted for senior management and other
employees on several dates from 11 November 2021 to 14 November 2022. The plans can be subdivided into two tranches. The first tranche includes 5,577,200
ordinary C shares following eligible employee investment in Motion Topco Limited, and 1,619,225 awards which entitle the employee to a cash payment equivalent to
the fair value of a notional number of shares upon vesting. All such awards are classified as cash-settled. 2,803,575 awards remain unissued and unallocated. Prior to an
exit event all unallocated awards must be allocated; the Group has exercised its judgement and assumed that all awards will be allocated before an interim trigger
event. Hence, the total value of this tranche of MSS awards will always be equal to 10,000,000 shares regardless of staff attrition over the vesting period. The value of
10,000,000 share awards has therefore been considered when calculating the fair value of the MSS plans.

The second tranche relates to 500,000 ordinary C shares issued on 22 July 2022 following conversion of ordinary A shares of Motion Topco Limited. This tranche
remains separate to the 10,000,000 share awards described above, but the terms of the awards are otherwise identical. Whilst in the case of the senior management
issues, the Board has retained some flexibility on the terms of settlement, the Group has exercised its judgement to conclude there is sufficient parity between MSS
awards granted to both senior management and other employees to account for all MSS awards in the same manner.

For MSS share awards, from December 2021 onwards, 12% per annum of the total award becomes eligible for cash-settlement at the expected vesting date, with the
maximum cash-settlement crystallising at 60% in December 2025 of the total value of the MSS share awards. For the purposes of calculating the accounting entries,
the full 60% is assumed to become eligible for cash-settlement (‘the cash settlement option’). Should the vesting event occur at an earlier date than estimated, the
number of MSS share awards eligible for cash settlement decreases.

The 60% of MSS share awards which have a cash settlement option are subject to a put option; this option requires Motion JVco Limited to purchase the shares at
fair market value for cash upon exercise at an interim trigger event. If the put option is not exercised, ordinary C shares in Motion Topco Limited would be retained
by the employee and hence 60% of MSS share awards issued are treated as compound instruments. The equity component of the instrument is deemed to have an
expected value of £nil at vesting (as the expected benefit relating to this portion of the award is identical to the expected cash benefit), and hence the entire sharebased payment expense relating to 60% of MSS share awards issued relates to expected cash-settlement.

**5.6** **SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)**

For the remaining 40% of MSS share awards issued, should the put option requiring Motion JVco Limited to purchase the other 60% at fair market value for cash be
exercised, the employee’s ordinary C shares would automatically convert to EI ordinary and preference B shares in quantities equivalent to fair market value at the
point of exercise. If the put option is not exercised, ordinary C shares in Motion Topco Limited would be retained by the employee and would no longer be the
obligation of the Group to settle. The awards are therefore treated as equity-settled and employees would receive the benefit of these shares at a final exit event
following an interim trigger event, assuming continuity of service. Amounts due to tax authorities in respect of shares issued are the obligation of the employee to
settle. Taxes due on cash bonus awards, equivalent to the value of a notional number of shares, will be settled via payroll.

Should the employee leave service after an interim trigger event but prior to a final exit event, they will receive a cash-settlement equivalent to the fair market value
of their converted EI shares at the date of leaving (or the lower of cost and fair market value if the individual is a competing leaver). Historic attrition data for all
levels of management has been reviewed in approximating the proportions of the 40% MSS awards that will be either equity or cash settled.

The key assumptions in calculating the share-based payments were as follows:

- The Monte-Carlo option pricing model was used to value all plans at the date of grant.

- The expected volatility is based on broadly comparable quoted companies and takes into account the expected life of the relevant award.

- The risk-free rate is equal to the prevailing UK Gilts rate at grant date, which is commensurate with the expected term.

- Expected dividend yield assumes that preference shares will roll forward any accrued dividend on the basis that distributions are discretionary. Therefore,
dividend yield is assumed to be 0.0%.

- The grant date has been determined for each plan following consideration of when there was mutual understanding between the Group and the employee on
the plan’s key terms; this date has been deemed to be the date of share issuance.

- The Group has exercised its judgement to conclude there is sufficient parity between MSS awards granted to both senior management and other employees to
account for all awards in the same manner.

IDR Resorts
The Group has a minority equity investment in IDR Resorts Sdn. Bhd. (IDR). IDR and its subsidiaries are deemed to be related parties as together they own
LEGOLAND Malaysia (see note 6.3).

Gangwon Jungdo Development Corporation
The Group has a minority equity investment in Gangwon Jungdo Development Corporation Ltd, the local company that has provided funding and infrastructure
support to the development of LEGOLAND Korea (see note 6.3).

Shanghai LEGOLAND Co.
The Group has a minority equity investment in Shanghai LEGOLAND Co., Ltd., the company developing the LEGOLAND Shanghai Resort. This is being developed
under the Group’s management contract model, where we manage the resort under a management contract. During 2022 £5 million of the investment made in
2021 was reallocated to non-current other receivables.

Big Bus Tours
The Group has an investment in Big Bus Tours Group Holdings Limited (BIG BUS), held substantially all in the form of loan notes. The value of the investment was
adjusted to £nil in 2020, when the BIG BUS city tour business was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and a capital restructuring exercise took place
whereby the priority of the Group’s investment reduced compared to other investors. The investment is valued adopting a market-based approach (based on
EBITDA multiples). Following a review of the value at the reporting date, the value has been retained at £nil (2021: £nil). Positive value adjustments could occur in
the future.

The Group also holds a minority equity investment valued at £nil (2021: £nil).

**Investments in associates and joint ventures**
LL Dubai Hotel
The Group holds a 40% equity interest in LL Dubai Hotel LLC. This is the company that developed the hotel at LEGOLAND Dubai, which opened in January 2022.
The negative share of reserves of £3 million reflects the Group’s share of that company’s retained losses for the period. Impairment charges have been made in the

**Accounting policies**
Defined contribution pension schemes
In the case of defined contribution schemes, the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate fund on behalf of the employee and has no further obligations to
them. The risks and rewards associated with this type of scheme are assumed by the members rather than the employer. Obligations for contributions to defined
contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.

Defined benefit pension schemes
A defined benefit scheme is a post-employment benefit scheme other than a defined contribution scheme. The Group’s net obligation is calculated for each scheme
by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to
determine its present value and offset by the fair value of any scheme assets. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit
method. All actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the period they occur directly in equity, through other comprehensive income.

**Defined contribution pension schemes**
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes and the total expense relating to those schemes in the current year was £13 million
_(2021: £11 million)._

**Defined benefit pension schemes**
The principal scheme that the Group operates is a closed scheme for certain former UK employees of The Tussauds Group, which was acquired by the Merlin
Group in 2007. The scheme entitles retired employees to receive an annual payment based on a percentage of final salary for each year of service that the employee
provided. The pension schemes have not directly invested in any of the Group’s own financial instruments or in properties or other assets used by the Group.

The most recent full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2021 and updated to 30 September 2022 due to material changes in
market conditions. As a result, it was agreed to pay annual deficit reduction contributions of £544,000, increasing at 3% per annum, payable monthly from 1 January
2023 to 30 November 2028.

The Group expects £1 million in ongoing contributions to be paid to its defined benefit schemes in 2023. The weighted average duration of the defined benefit
obligation at 31 December 2022 was 10 years (2021: 17 years).

Actuarial assumptions
Principal actuarial assumptions (expressed as weighted averages) at the year end were:

2022 2021

Discount rate 5.0% 1.8%

Rate of price inflation 3.3% 3.5%

The scheme is closed to future accrual for active members and therefore there is no link to future salary increases.

Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on published statistics and mortality tables. For the Tussauds Group scheme the actuarial table used is S3PxA. The
mortality assumption adopted predicts that a current 65 year old male would have a life expectancy to age 87 and a female would have a life expectancy to age 89.

available in respect of certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’ and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial instrument disclosures’.

The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements.

These financial statements have been prepared for the 53 weeks ended 31 December 2022 (2021: 52 weeks ended 25 December 2021).

A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is set out below.

**Investments in subsidiaries**
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, less provision for impairment. The carrying amount of the Company’s investments in subsidiaries is reviewed annually to
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the investment’s recoverable amount is estimated. If the carrying value of the
investment exceeds the recoverable amount, the investment is considered to be impaired and is written down to the recoverable amount. The impairment loss is
recognised in the income statement.

**Foreign currency**
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains
and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.

**Taxation**
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to items recognised directly in
equity, when it is recognised directly in equity, or when it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income, when it is recognised through the statement
of comprehensive income.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, and any
adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.

Deferred tax is provided on certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and taxation purposes
respectively. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither
accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent that they will
probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount
of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.

After considering forecast future profits, deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those assets
can be utilised

**i** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Classification of financial instruments issued by the Company**
Financial instruments are recognised on the statement of financial position when the Company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The
accounting policy for each type of financial instrument is included within the relevant note.

Financial assets are initially measured at fair value, unless otherwise noted, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive
income or fair value through profit or loss. A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or the Company
transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.

Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, plus, in the case of other financial liabilities, directly attributable transaction costs. Other financial liabilities,
primarily the Company’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings, are measured at amortised cost. Financial liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss
and are held on the statement of financial position at fair value. A financial liability is derecognised when the Company’s obligations are discharged, expire or are
cancelled. Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance costs.

An equity instrument is any contract that has a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. Finance payments associated with
financial instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity. The preference shares issued by the Company carry a fixed,
cumulative, preferential dividend which accrues (but is not payable) on each preference share on a daily basis from the date of issue of the relevant preference share.
Payment of these dividends is at the discretion of the Company and accordingly they have been classified as equity.

Where financial instruments consist of a combination of debt and equity, the Company will assess the substance of the arrangement in place and decide how to
attribute values to each taking into consideration the policy definitions above.

**Dividends**
Dividends are recognised through equity on the earlier of their approval by the Company’s shareholders or their payment.

**Judgements and estimates**
The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Company’s accounting policies. It also requires the use of
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management
considers the area of estimation that has the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements to be the estimation of the value in use of
the Merlin Entertainments Group of companies, which underpins the annual review of the carrying amount of the Company’s investment in subsidiaries (see note iii).

**ii** **OPERATING EXPENSES**

**Staff numbers and costs**
The average number of persons employed by the Company during the year was seven (2021: seven), being the Directors of the Company.

The employment costs of the Directors of the Company have been borne by other Group companies for their services to the Group as a whole. The costs related
to these Directors are included within note 2.1 of the consolidated financial statements.

**Auditor’s remuneration**
Fees paid to Ernst & Young LLP for audit and other services to the Company are not disclosed in its individual accounts as the Group accounts are required to
disclose such fees on a consolidated basis (note 2.1 of the consolidated financial statements).

A full list of Group companies is included in note 6.6 of the consolidated financial statements on pages F-67 to F-72.

Upon the vesting date of the share incentive plans, employees of the Group will hold a non-controlling interest in Motion Topco Limited of 0.16% (see note 5.5 of
the consolidated financial statements). Cash settlements occurring upon vesting of the schemes are the obligation of the Company to settle. Additional investments
of £20 million have been recognised in the year with a corresponding liability in other payables (see note 5.6 of the consolidated financial statements).

The carrying amount of the Company’s investments in subsidiaries has been reviewed to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.

The approach to impairment testing within the consolidated accounts is set out in note 4.3 to the consolidated accounts which includes details on the key
assumptions and estimates used when calculating the net present value of future cash flows from the Group’s businesses. A consistent approach is taken for testing
the Company’s investment in its subsidiary, with this assessment also including value for new business development that is excluded from the goodwill impairment
testing until such time as new sites become operational. The approach adopted therefore applies consistent judgements and estimates as set out in the impairment
testing note 4.3, other than for new business development.

Impairment reviews are often sensitive to changes in key assumptions. Sensitivity analysis is therefore performed on the calculated recoverable amounts considering
incremental changes in the key assumptions, where the balance being tested is material and headroom is limited.

In 2022 there is sufficient headroom such that the valuation is not sensitive to even significant changes in any of the key assumptions. Headroom would remain if pretax discount rates used had been higher by a factor of 10%, combined with the long term growth rate used being 2.25% instead of 2.5%.

Issue of shares
The nominal value of shares in issue is shown in share capital, with any additional consideration for those shares shown in share premium.

Ordinary shares
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time.

Each ordinary share entitles the holder of that ordinary share to receive notice of and to attend and to speak and to vote at general meetings of the Company (on
the basis of one vote per ordinary share), or on any resolution proposed to members as a written resolution. Each ordinary share in the capital of the Company
ranks equally in all respects and no shareholder holds shares carrying special rights relating to the control of the Company.

Preference shares
The preference shares earn a fixed, cumulative, preferential dividend at the rate of 6% per annum on the issue price of the preference shares, which accrues (but is
not payable) on each preference share on a daily basis from the date of issue of the relevant preference share, and ends on the day preceding the redemption date,
compounding annually on each anniversary of the compounding date.

The preference shares rank ahead of the ordinary shares for all purposes and no dividend, distribution, return of capital and/or reduction of capital is paid on the
ordinary shares until the preference shares have been redeemed in full.

Each preference share entitles the holder of that preference share to receive notice of and to attend and to speak and to vote at general meetings of the Company
(on the basis of one vote per preference share), or on any resolution proposed to members as a written resolution.

**Capital reserve**
During 2019 the Company issued £156 million 0% subordinated unsecured shareholder loan notes due 31 October 2020. In accordance with the accounting policy as
set out in note i, these were classed as financial liabilities. Reflecting the off-market interest rate attached to these loan notes, these were initially recognised at fair
value of £150 million with the difference treated as a capital contribution. During 2020 the shareholder loans were repaid and the proceeds reinvested in a further
issue of new ordinary and preference shares to the existing shareholders. The capital reserve was eliminated through retained earnings in 2021.

**Dividends**
Dividends are recognised through equity on the earlier of their approval by the Company’s shareholders or their payment. The Directors of the Company have
declared their intention not to pay a dividend for the year ended 31 December 2022 (2021: £nil).

**Retained earnings**
The profit after tax for the year in the accounts of Motion JVco Limited is £nil (2021: £nil).

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
#### To the Members of Motion JVco Limited


**Opinion**
We have audited the financial statements of Motion JVco Limited (the
Company) and its subsidiaries (the Group) for the 52 weeks ended
25 December 2021 which comprise consolidated income statement, the
consolidated and Company statement of financial position, consolidated
statement of cash flows, the consolidated statement of comprehensive
income, the consolidated and Company statement of changes in equity and
the related notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies.The
financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the
Group financial statements is applicable law and international accounting
standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation
of the Company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

In our opinion:

- the financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group’s and of
the Company’s affairs as at 25 December 2021 and of the Group’s loss
for the 52 weeks then ended;

- the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006;

- the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice; and

- the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the
requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

**Basis for opinion**
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under
those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the
audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent
of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant
to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical
Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with these requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Conclusions relating to going concern**
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors’
use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the
financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material
uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively,
may cast significant doubt on the Group and Company’s ability to continue
as a going concern for a period of 17 months from when the financial
statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect
to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted,
this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a
going concern.


**Other information**
The other information comprises the information included in the Annual
Report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
The Directors are responsible for the other information contained within the
Annual Report.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information
and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial
statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise
appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies
or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether
there is a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If,
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

**Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006**
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

- the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

- the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report have been prepared in
accordance with applicable legal requirements.

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the
Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we
have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or
Directors’ Report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to
which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or
returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches
not visited by us; or

- the Company financial statements are not in agreement with the
accounting records and returns; or

- certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are
not made; or

- we have not received all the information and explanations we require
for our audit.

**Responsibilities of directors**
The Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for
such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the
preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.


-----

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
#### To the Members of Motion JVco Limited


In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for
assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using
the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to
liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no
realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of
users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

**Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of**
**detecting irregularities, including fraud**
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and
regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined
above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a
material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by,
for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.
The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities,
including fraud is detailed below. However, the primary responsibility for the
prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with
governance of the entity and management.

Our approach was as follows:

- We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks
that are applicable to the Group and Company and determined that
the most significant which are directly relevant to specific assertions in
the financial statements, are those that relate to the reporting
framework (International Accounting Standards in conformity with the
requirements of the Companies Act 2006, and FRS 101 and the
Companies Act 2006), Health and Safety regulations and the relevant
tax compliance regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Group
operates.

- We understood how Motion JVco Limited is complying with those
frameworks by making enquiries of management, those responsible for
legal and compliance procedures and the Company Secretary.We
corroborated our enquiries through our review of Board and other
relevant Committee minutes, discussions with the Audit Committee,
review of whistleblowing reports and any correspondence received
from regulatory bodies.



- We assessed the susceptibility of the Group and Company’s financial
statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur
by meeting with management and those charged with governance to
understand where there was susceptibility to fraud.We also
considered performance targets and their influence on efforts made
by management to manage earnings or influence the perceptions of
the users of the financial statements.

- Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to
identify irregularities including fraud.We performed audit procedures,
including through testing journal entries and other adjustments for
appropriateness, which were designed to provide reasonable
assurance the financial statements were free from material fraud or
error. Our procedures involved review of Board minutes to identify
non-compliance with such laws and regulations, review of reporting to
the Audit Committee on compliance with regulations, enquiries of
legal counsel, Group management, the Audit Committee, internal audit
and subsidiary management at all full-scope components and review of
any relevant investigations undertaken.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at
**www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.This description forms part of**
our auditor’s report.

**Use of our report**
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for
no other purpose.To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed.

# SECTION 1 BASIS OF PREPARATION

52 weeks ended 25 December 2021 (2020: 52 weeks ended 26 December 2020)

**1.1** **BASIS OF PREPARATION**

Motion JVco Limited (the Company) is a private company limited by shares which is incorporated in the United Kingdom. Its registered office is Link House, 25 West
Street, Poole, Dorset, BH15 1LD.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The consolidated financial statements are also prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002. The Company prepares its parent Company financial statements in accordance with Financial Reporting
Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101).

This section sets out the Group’s accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole. Where an accounting policy is specific to one note, the policy
is described in the note to which it relates. The accounting policies have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these
consolidated financial statements and have been applied consistently by all subsidiaries and joint ventures.

The Group prepares its annual consolidated financial statements on a 52 or 53 week basis. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared for the
52 weeks ended 25 December 2021 (2020: 52 weeks ended 26 December 2020).

The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments and certain investments which are measured
at their fair value. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling. All values are stated in £ million (£m) except where otherwise indicated.

**Going concern**
The Group reported a loss for the year of £140 million (2020 as restated: £819 million) and generated operating cash inflows of £459 million (2020 as restated: outflow
_of £75 million). The Board has assessed the Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern to the end of Q3 2023 (being the ‘going concern assessment_
period’). The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which the Directors consider to be appropriate for the reasons set out below.

Funding
The going concern assessment considers the Group’s projected liquidity position and headroom over covenant thresholds from existing committed financing facilities
throughout the going concern assessment period. As at 25 December 2021, the Group had a cash balance of £185 million and available undrawn facilities of
£372 million relating to the Group’s revolving credit facility (RCF), with no unexpected post balance sheet changes in liquidity; we have seen cash outflows since the
end of 2021 reflecting the normal seasonality of trading combined with ongoing capital investment. The Group’s sources of financing and its net debt at the reporting
date are detailed in notes 4.1 and 4.2.

A financial covenant exists in relation to the Group’s £400 million RCF, which is required when the RCF is drawn by 40% or more (net of cash). It requires the
Group to maintain adjusted consolidated senior secured leverage below 10x. Effective June 2021, the Group agreed with its RCF lenders to waive the leverage
covenant until Q3 2023. The terms of the waiver agreement require the Group to maintain a minimum liquidity of £75 million (to include amounts undrawn from the
RCF, and cash and cash equivalents), over the period of the waiver. The Group has complied with all covenants and the terms of the waiver agreement throughout
the year.

Base case
The projections and forecasts prepared for the going concern assessment period to the end of Q3 2023 are derived from the Group’s 2022 budget and longer term
strategic plan, approved by the Merlin Board in December 2021, with relevant refinements made to reflect more recent information. This period has been selected as
the going concern assessment period to ensure that it includes the likely liquidity low point in the next trading cycle.

Our ‘base case’ forecast over the going concern assessment period is based on what we believe is a balanced approach. In this base case, extending up to the end of
Q3 2023, we have made certain key assumptions:

- We have assumed that the likelihood of any significant future COVID-19 related lockdowns and restrictions is low, reflecting, among other factors, the positive
impact of COVID-19 vaccine roll outs.

- We expect the ability of people to travel across borders will remain restricted and that there will be a slower recovery in levels of international tourism than in
domestic markets. This will impact our attractions to different extents.

- The impact of reduced visitation (versus pre COVID-19 levels) is expected to be partially offset by revenue management initiatives.

- Our new business development capital expenditure plans include the completion of LEGOLAND Korea, opening May 2022 within the going concern assessment
period. Capital expenditure on planned Midway attractions also continues to be incurred during the going concern assessment period. Essential capital
expenditure to ensure the health and safety of our guests and staff at existing attractions will continue.

- The base case specifically excludes any potential acquisitions over the period or any strategic initiatives not yet confirmed.

In this base case, there would be no breach of lending facilities taking into account the terms of the covenant calculations. There are no significant restrictions on the
ability of the Company to move cash around the Group, and no material capital repayments of debt falling due within the going concern assessment period, with the
next maturity of facilities being in respect of €500 million of 7.0% senior secured notes due 2025.

The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for a 17 month period from the date of approval of these financial statements up to the end of Q3 2023 which
indicate that under the base case the Group will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities as they fall due

**1.1** **BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)**

Downside scenarios
It remains very difficult to assess how the COVID-19 situation will evolve. The Directors believe the base case scenario above is reasonable, assuming as it does that
the risks of potential future lockdowns and/or trading restrictions have reduced significantly, but also assuming there will be delayed recovery due to continuing
travel restrictions and reduced international tourism.

However, it is possible that the recovery profile is slower than in the base case. The Directors have therefore prepared a severe but plausible downside scenario,
with the following assumptions which differ from the base case:

- This scenario models significantly slower recovery in international tourism than that modelled in the base case, assuming no further recovery in the going
concern assessment period above the actual recovery experienced in the financial year ended 25 December 2021.

- For those costs where the Group considers there to be inflationary risks above budgeted levels in the base case, this scenario applies increases to variable staff
costs and energy prices versus 2021.

It is also possible that other negative events may occur, including external incidents such as terrorism. Furthermore, while our trading operations are not directly
affected by the war in Ukraine, this and other geopolitical factors could lead to reduced levels of international tourism and further inflationary pressure on
operating costs. In addition, this inflationary pressure in the wider economy could reduce consumers’ discretionary spending, which could impact both visitation and
spend levels in visitor attractions.

While not modelled in the downside scenario, there are numerous mitigating actions the Group could take to mitigate both modelled and unmodelled adverse
impacts. These mitigating measures are considered to be realistically available to the Group based on historical experience, enabling us to meet our liabilities as they
fall due should this situation arise. Within the Group’s control, significant cost cutting measures could be implemented across operations and the Group could delay
uncommitted capital expenditure. While not in the direct control of the Group, we could also seek to further extend waivers to financial covenants on its borrowing
facilities, renew/replace existing facilities and/or raise further finance through cash injections from the consortium of investors in the Company. Given the Group’s
history of cash generation and the successful issue of debt securities during the COVID-19 pandemic, we would expect to be able to raise such funds as were
necessary. However, there is no guarantee that such funds will be available.

In the modelled downside scenario, and not taking into account the impact of any mitigation measures, the Group’s currently available liquidity would remain
positive, albeit reduced, throughout the going concern assessment period. Consistent with the base case, under this scenario there would be no breach of lending
facilities taking into account the terms of the covenant calculations, and it indicates that the Group would still have sufficient funds to enable it to operate within its
available facilities and settle its liabilities as they fall due through the going concern assessment period.

Conclusion
In the 2020 Annual Report and Accounts the Directors disclosed a material uncertainty, relating to circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, that cast
significant doubt on the Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

The Directors have concluded there is no longer a material uncertainty relating to the going concern assessment.

Considering the Group and Company’s statement of financial position, available facilities, cash flow forecasts and the above modelled base case and downside
scenarios, financial projections indicate that the Group will have sufficient funds and resources to continue in operational existence, operate within its available
facilities and settle its liabilities as they fall due over the going concern assessment period. Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in
preparing its consolidated Group and Company financial statements.

**Basis of consolidation**
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Motion JVco Limited and its subsidiaries at the end of each reporting period (see note 5.7)
and include its share of its joint ventures’ results using the equity method.

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns through its involvement with
the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated
financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.

All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated.

**Foreign currency**
Foreign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the
settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying net investment hedges.

The results and financial position of those Group companies that do not have a Sterling functional currency are translated into Sterling as follows:

- Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the end of the reporting period.

- Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period.

- All resulting exchange differences are recognised in equity in the translation reserve.

The reporting date foreign exchange rates by major currency are provided in note 4.3.

**Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group**
Financial instruments are recognised on the statement of financial position when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The
accounting policy for each type of financial instrument is included within the relevant notes.

Financial assets are initially measured at fair value, unless otherwise noted, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive
income or fair value through profit or loss. A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or the Group
transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.

Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, plus, in the case of other financial liabilities, directly attributable transaction costs. Other financial liabilities,
primarily the Group’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost. Financial liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss and
are held on the statement of financial position at fair value. A financial liability is derecognised when the Group’s obligations are discharged, expire or are cancelled.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance costs.

An equity instrument is any contract that has a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Finance payments associated with
financial instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity. The preference shares issued by the Company carry a fixed,
cumulative, preferential dividend which accrues (but is not payable) on each preference share on a daily basis from the date of issue of the relevant preference share.
Payment of these dividends is at the discretion of the Company and accordingly they have been classified as equity.

Where financial instruments consist of a combination of debt and equity, the Group will assess the substance of the arrangement in place and decide how to attribute
values to each taking into consideration the policy definitions above.

Further information on equity instruments issued by the Group is set out in note 4.5.

**New standards and interpretations**
A full list of new accounting standards and interpretations that have been implemented in the year, including those which have had no significant impact, can be found
in note 5.4.

Change in accounting policy – software-as-a-service (SaaS arrangements)
In April 2021, an IFRIC agenda decision was issued in relation to the accounting treatment for configuration and customisation costs in cloud computing
arrangements. This guidance clarified that in order for an intangible asset to be capitalised in relation to configuration and customisation costs in a software-as-aservice (SaaS) arrangement, it is necessary for there to be control of the underlying software asset or for there to be a separate intangible asset which meets the
definition in IAS 38 ‘Intangible assets’.

Since 2019, the Group has undertaken numerous technology-based projects that utilise SaaS arrangements. The Group has completed its assessment of the financial
reporting impact of this IFRIC agenda decision and has updated its accounting policy in the financial statements to align with the clarified guidance within the IFRIC
agenda decision. As a result, the Group has expensed all costs previously capitalised associated with both the configuration and customisation of these SaaS
arrangements. Accordingly, the Group's consolidated statements of financial position as at 26 December 2020 and 28 December 2019 have both been restated in
accordance with IAS 8 ‘Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors’.

This change in accounting policy resulted in an overstatement of equity as at 28 December 2019 of £13 million, which has been corrected by reducing opening
retained earnings. In 2020 and 2021 adjustments relating to intangible asset costs, amounting to £5 million and £3 million respectively, increased exceptional
operating expenses in those periods (see note 2.2). The net impact of these adjustments following the reversal of underlying accumulated amortisation and the
taxation impact is an increase of costs of £3 million and a decrease of costs of £2 million in 2020 and 2021 respectively.

**Prior year restatements**
During 2021, the Group determined that the financial statements for prior periods contained errors, as set out below. As a result, previously reported figures have
been restated. These restatements have not impacted previously reported underlying revenue or underlying EBITDA.

**1.1** **BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)**

Valuation of brands at acquisition of Merlin Entertainments plc by Motion Acquisition Limited
On 4 November 2019, the acquisition of Merlin Entertainments plc by Motion Acquisition Limited (a subsidiary of Motion JVco Limited) became effective. This
business combination was accounted for by applying the purchase method, where individually identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were valued and any remaining
balance was assigned to goodwill. As part of the purchase price allocation exercise, acquired brands were all valued in Sterling, totalling £1,316 million. During 2021,
this was reviewed, and it has been determined that it is more appropriate for certain brands to be valued in Euros to align with the functional currency of the foreign
operations acquired.

This determination has caused a change in the treatment of deferred tax liabilities relating to these brands. Deferred tax was previously calculated using UK
substantively enacted taxation rates but has now been restated using local taxation rates to align with the foreign operations to which these assets relate. The
increase in deferred tax liabilities of £20 million as at 28 December 2019 was offset by an increase in goodwill.

As a result of movements in foreign exchange rates, equity as at 28 December 2019, as previously reported, was overstated by £2 million. The opening translation
reserve has therefore been adjusted to correct this.

Additional adjustments in 2020 reflect the subsequent retranslation of these balances and changes in tax rates, resulting in a further increase to goodwill and
intangible assets of £12 million, a reduction in deferred tax liabilities of £2 million, a credit to the translation reserve of £9 million (£7 million on a cumulative basis)
and an increase in retained earnings of £5 million (see notes 2.4 and 3.2).

In aggregate the net impact of changing the currencies adopted for the valuations as at 28 December 2019 was an overstatement of equity of £2 million, and an
understatement of £14 million for the year ended 26 December 2020, with a cumulative impact of £12 million.

Taxation
Each year the Group performs a review of its deferred tax position to ensure that the principles for asset recognition are consistently applied. The review considers
if it is probable that each subsidiary undertaking with recognised deferred tax assets would have sufficient taxable profits to utilise recognised assets in the future. In
performing this year’s review the Group has revisited the 2020 balances. This resulted in a £10 million adjustment to deferred tax assets being identified. This in turn
reduced the taxation credit recognised by the Group in the prior year.

Current tax balances that have arisen in the different jurisdictions should be presented as gross receivables and payables to reflect that there is no right of net
settlement rather than being presented net. We have therefore restated the 26 December 2020 tax receivable and payable by £34 million to present these balances
on a gross basis as noted above. The error did not have an income statement impact.

At the same time, an assessment has also been performed to quantify deferred tax balances that have arisen in the same jurisdictions and are expected to unwind
over a similar timeframe and therefore should be netted rather than being presented as gross. This has resulted in a prior year reclassification of £146 million
between deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. See note 2.4 for further details.

Impact of change in accounting policy and prior year restatements
The impact of the change in accounting policy for SaaS arrangements and the correction of the prior period errors had the following impact on the statement of

**Judgements and estimates**
The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. It also requires the use of estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Judgements
Management considers the following areas to be the judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. They are
explained in more detail in the related notes:

- _Useful life of brands (note 3.2) - where significant brands have been recognised as part of an acquisition, they have been assessed as having indefinite useful lives_
and management have considered that this judgement remains appropriate.

- _Goodwill impairment reviews (note 3.3) - the level at which goodwill is initially allocated and thereafter monitored._

- _Vesting period of share-based payments (note 4.6)_ - the Group has exercised its judgement in determining the grant date of the three schemes awarded in the year,
which has been deemed to be the date of share issuance. Considering ongoing future strategies of both the Group and the Group’s shareholders, the most likely
vesting dates for each scheme have been deemed to be in four or ten years for interim trigger events and exit respectively.

Estimates
Management considers the following areas to involve a significant degree of estimation uncertainty:

- _Taxation (note 2.4) - recognition of deferred tax balances and accounting for tax risks._

- _Valuation of the LEGOLAND Parks (LLP) and Resort Theme Parks (RTP) Operating Groups’ assets and impairment (note 3.3) – the estimation of future cash flows_
together with the discount rates adopted when calculating the value in use of assets. The valuation of other assets and impairment, excluding LLP and RTP,
involves a degree of estimation uncertainty but the likelihood of a resulting change in value is less significant.

- _Provisions (note 3.5) - estimated outflow to settle the obligations and, where relevant, the appropriate discount and inflation rates to apply._

- _Lease obligations (note 4.4) - estimation of the discount rate used in the calculation of certain lease liabilities._

- _Share-based payments (note 4.6) - the implied enterprise value of Motion Topco Limited was calculated as at December 2021 in order to calculate share-based_
payment valuations for the three schemes awarded in the year. The valuation was performed using the Monte Carlo option pricing model, the inputs to which
involve estimation uncertainty. Future valuation fluctuations could materially impact share-based payment expenses recognised in subsequent periods.

Other non-significant areas that include a degree of estimation uncertainty are:

- _Interest-bearing loans and borrowings (note 4.2) - expected period of borrowings when calculating the effective interest rate on those borrowings._

- _Lease obligations (note 4.4) - IFRS 16 defines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease together with the options to extend or terminate a lease, if_
the lessee were reasonably certain to exercise that option. Where a lease includes the option for the Group to extend the lease term, the Group makes a
judgement as to whether it is reasonably certain that the option will be taken.

- _Investments (note 5.1) - earnings multiples and discounted cash flows when calculating the fair value of investments._

- _Employee benefits (note 5.2) - assumed discount rate, inflation rate and mortality when valuing defined benefit liabilities._

While these areas do not present a significant risk resulting in a material adjustment, they are areas of focus for management.

**Revenue**
Revenue represents the amounts received (excluding VAT and similar taxes) in the areas set out below and which have been disaggregated in the segmental
information presented above. When accounting for revenue, an assessment is made, considering the control principles of IFRS 15, as to whether parties involved in
providing goods or services to a customer are acting as a principal (if they control delivery to the customer) or, if they are arranging for those goods or services to
be provided by the other party, as an agent.

- _Visitor revenue - represents admissions tickets, retail, food and beverage sales and other commercial offerings such as photos and games experiences inside an_
attraction. Tickets and other services can be bought in advance, generally online, in which case they are held in deferred revenue and recognised when the visitor
uses those tickets or services or the validity period expires. Revenue from annual passes and other tickets that entitle a customer to continued visits over a
period of time is deferred and then recognised over the period that the pass is valid. Retail and food and beverage revenue, along with other similar commercial
offerings, is recognised at point of sale.

- _Accommodation revenue - represents overnight stay and conference room revenue along with food and beverage revenue earned within our hotels and other_
accommodation offerings. Accommodation revenue is recognised at the time when a customer stays at the accommodation.

- _Other revenue - represents sponsorship, function, management and development contract revenue along with other sundry items. Sponsorship revenue is_
recognised over the relevant contract term. Function revenue is recognised at the time of the event. Management contract revenue is recognised as it is earned.
Where the Group enters into contracts for attraction development, revenue is recognised over time as performance obligations under the contracts are met.

**Cost of sales**
Cost of sales of £226 million (2020: £159 million) represents variable expenses (excluding VAT and similar taxes) incurred from revenue generating activities. Retail
inventory, food and beverage consumables and costs associated with the delivery of accommodation are the principal expenses included within this category.

The total charge for the year for share-based payments is less than £1 million. Further details are provided in note 4.6.

The Group has accessed government support measures in the geographies in which it operates, including employee furlough schemes. This funding meets the
definition of a government grant and the income recognised in the year in relation to these schemes was £19 million (2020: £49 million), primarily in the UK,
Germany, Australia, and Denmark.

Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the Group has complied with the relevant conditions within the agreement and that the
grant will be received. For each grant, the Group assesses whether it relates to either capital or operational expenditure incurred. A grant relating to expenses
already incurred is recognised in the period in which it becomes receivable, offsetting the expenses the grants are intended to compensate. The funding received is
included within the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

Directors’ remuneration
Directors’ remuneration for the year was £0.3 million, being the remuneration of the highest paid Director (2020: £0.2 million). There were no Company pension
contributions payable.

_changes made to our organisational structures in attractions and support functions, primarily in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, together with the completion of long term productivity_
_initiatives commenced in previous years. The Group has changed its accounting policy related to the capitalisation of certain software assets following the IFRS Interpretations Committee’s agenda_
_decision published in April 2021. This change in accounting policy led to an increase in exceptional operating expenses relating to productivity and efficiency activities of £3 million in the current_
_year and £5 million for 2020. All 2020 results are restated; see note 1.1 for further details. They are separately presented as they are not part of the Group’s underlying operating expenses._

_(2)_ _Transaction costs within other operating expenses in 2020 primarily represented professional and advisor fees incurred in connection with the acquisition of the Merlin Group in 2019, certain of_
_which became payable in 2020. In 2021 certain costs in respect of previous transactions were finalised leading to the release of amounts previously provided for of £1 million. They are separately_
_presented as they are not part of the Group’s underlying operating expenses._

_(3)_ _Impairment charges in 2020 of £260 million were in respect of goodwill associated with the LEGOLAND Parks Operating Group. These reflected latest estimates at the end of the reporting period_
_of the combined future performance of the attractions within that Operating Group, taking into account reviews of the market and economic conditions at those locations. They were separately_
_presented as ordinarily goodwill is not amortised and therefore these charges did not form part of the underlying result._

_(4)_ _Impairment charges in 2020 of £78 million in property, plant and equipment and £14 million in right-of-use assets were in respect of certain of the Group’s attractions. The discounted cash flows_
_that underpinned our value in use calculations reflected the current business plans which were updated for factors including the short term impact of COVID-19. In particular, this included_
_consideration of LEGOLAND New York where the opening had been delayed. In 2021 an impairment credit has been recorded in the year of £1 million in respect of one Midway location that was_
_subject to impairment in 2020. They are separately presented as they are not part of the Group’s underlying depreciation charge._

**2.3** **FINANCE INCOME AND COSTS**

**Accounting policies**
Income and costs
Finance income comprises interest income from financial assets and investments, applicable foreign exchange gains and gains on hedging instruments that are
recognised in the income statement. Finance costs comprise interest expense, finance charges on finance leases, applicable foreign exchange losses and losses
on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement. Interest income and interest expense are recognised as they accrue, using the effective
interest method.

Capitalisation of borrowing costs
Where assets take a substantial time to complete, the Group capitalises borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of
those assets.

**2.4** **TAXATION**

**Accounting policies**
The tax charge for the year is recognised in the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income, according to the accounting treatment of the related
transaction. The tax charge comprises both current and deferred tax.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable income, using tax rates substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax
payable in respect of previous periods.

Deferred tax is provided on certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and taxation purposes
respectively. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither
accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent that they will
probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount
of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.

After considering forecast future profits, deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those assets
can be utilised. This assessment is made after considering a number of factors, including the Group’s future trading expectations.

Provisions for uncertain tax positions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and management judge that it is probable that
there will be a future outflow of economic benefits to settle that obligation. Uncertain tax positions are assessed and measured on an issue by issue basis within the
jurisdictions that we operate using management’s estimate of the most likely outcome. A combination of in-house tax experts, previous experience and professional firms
is used when assessing uncertain tax positions.

The effective tax rate (ETR) reflects updates to the headline UK rate, including the effect on the measurement of deferred tax.

The difference between the reported ETR of (48.9)% and the UK standard tax rate of 19.0% is primarily attributable to the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities due to the
change in the UK tax rate from 19% to 25% from 1 April 2023, and the non-recognition of tax losses.

In 2020, the difference between the underlying ETR (excluding exceptionals) of 20.0% (as restated) and the UK standard rate was attributable to a number of factors
including the Group’s geographic mix of profits and the benefit derived from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. This was offset by the nonrecognition of tax losses and the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities due to the change in the UK tax rate when it was maintained at 19%, rather than reducing it to 17%
from 1 April 2020. In 2020 the Group benefited from certain reliefs available in the CARES Act in the US. This allowed operating losses generated in 2020 to be carried
back five years. As the US corporate tax rate was higher in the earlier years the Group obtained a permanent benefit from the carry back.

Significant factors impacting the Group’s future ETR include the Group’s geographic mix of profits and changes to local or international tax laws. In the 3 March 2021
Budget it was announced that the UK tax rate will increase to 25% from 1 April 2023. This will have a consequential effect on the Group’s future tax charge.

In April 2019 the European Commission (EC) announced its final decision that certain elements of the UK’s Controlled Foreign Company rules partially represent State
Aid. The UK Government has made an annulment application against the EC decision. Separately, the Group has made its own application. In February 2021, the Group
received charging notices from HMRC for £28 million, which have been paid. The Group expects the applications will ultimately be successful and accordingly the
payments are held as a receivable. If the applications are ultimately unsuccessful then this could result in an increase in the Group’s future effective tax rate.

# SECTION 3  OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 

52 weeks ended 25 December 2021 (2020: 52 weeks ended 26 December 2020)

**3.1** **PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT**

**Accounting policies**
Property, plant and equipment (PPE) are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Where components of an item of PPE have different useful lives, they are accounted for separately.

The initial cost of PPE includes all costs incurred in bringing the asset into use and includes external costs for the acquisition, construction and commissioning of the
asset, internal project costs (primarily staff expenses) and capitalised borrowing costs.

Assets acquired through business combinations
At the time of a business combination PPE is separately recognised and valued. Given the specialised nature of the PPE acquired, fair values are calculated on a
depreciated replacement cost basis. The key estimates are the replacement cost, where industry specific indices are used to restate original historic cost; and
depreciation, where the total and remaining economic useful lives are considered, together with the residual value of each asset. The total estimated lives applied
are consistent with those set out below. Residual values are based on industry specific indices. Freehold land is valued using a market approach.

New sites
Capital expenditure on new attractions includes all the costs of bringing the items of PPE within that attraction into use ready for the opening of the attraction.
Pre-opening costs are only capitalised to the extent they are required to bring PPE into its working condition. Other pre-opening costs are expensed as incurred.

Existing sites
Subsequent expenditure on items of PPE in our existing estate can be broadly split into two categories:

- Capital expenditure which adds new items of PPE to an attraction or which extends the operational life, or enhances existing items, of PPE is accounted for as
an addition to PPE. Examples of such expenditure include new rides or displays and enhancements to rides or displays, which increase the appeal of our
attractions to visitors.

- Expenditure which is incurred to maintain the items of PPE in a safe and useable state and to maintain the useful life of items of PPE is charged to the income
statement as incurred. Examples of such expenditure include regular servicing and maintenance of buildings, rides and displays and ongoing repairs to items
of PPE.

Government grants
Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the Group has complied with the relevant conditions within the agreement and that the
grant will be received. For each grant, the Group assesses whether it relates to either capital or operational expenditure incurred. The Group has elected to
deduct grants related to capital expenditure from the total project costs within property, plant and equipment and amortise them systematically over the useful life
of the assets.

Depreciation
Land is not depreciated. Assets under construction are not depreciated until they come into use, when they are transferred to buildings or plant and equipment as
appropriate. Depreciation is then charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of PPE. Asset lives
for plant and equipment vary depending on the nature of the asset, from short life assets such as IT assets, up to long term infrastructure assets. No residual values
are typically considered.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

Asset class Depreciation policy

Freehold/long leasehold buildings 50 years

Leasehold buildings 20 – 50 years (dependent on life of lease)

Plant and equipment 5 – 30 years

During the year the Group reviews useful economic lives and tests PPE for impairment in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy, as referred to in note 3.3.
There were no impairment charges in the year. In 2020 impairment charges of £78 million were made as the discounted cash flows that underpinned our value in use
calculations reflected our business plans which were updated for factors including the short term impact of COVID-19. In particular, this included consideration of
LEGOLAND New York where the opening had been delayed.

**Capital commitments**
At the year end the Group had a number of outstanding capital commitments in respect of capital expenditure at its existing attractions (including accommodation),
as well as for Midway attractions and LEGOLAND parks that are under construction. These commitments are expected to be settled within two financial years of
the reporting date. These amount to £70 million (2020: £143 million) for which no provision has been made.

**3.2** **GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS**

**Accounting policies**
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of an acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired less any contingent liabilities
assumed. Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-generating units and is not amortised but is
tested annually for impairment. In respect of joint ventures, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the joint venture.

Where they arise on acquisition, brands are valued using the excess earnings method. All the significant brands acquired are assessed as having indefinite useful
economic lives. This assessment is based upon the strong historical performance of the brands over a number of economic cycles, the ability to roll out the brands,
and the Directors’ intentions regarding the future use of brands. The Directors feel this is a suitable policy for a brands business which invests in and maintains the
brands, and foresee no technological developments or competitor actions which would put a finite life on the brands. The brands are tested annually for impairment.
Other brands are amortised over a period of fifteen years.

Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.

Other intangible assets comprise software licences deemed to be controlled by the Group, sponsorship rights and other contract or relationship based intangible
assets. They are amortised on a straight-line basis from the date they are available for use. They are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and
impairment losses.

The estimated useful lives of other intangible assets are as follows:

Licences Life of licence (up to 15 years)

Other intangible assets Relevant contractual period (up to 30 years)

**3.2** **GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED)**

Intangible assets are tested for impairment in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy, as referred to in note 3.3. As a result of these tests, no impairment
charges have been made in the year (2020: £260 million in respect of goodwill associated with the LEGOLAND Parks Operating Group). The impairment charge in 2020
reflected latest estimates at the end of the reporting period of the combined future performance of the attractions within that Operating Group, taking into account
reviews of the market and economic conditions at those locations.

In the year, the Group changed its accounting policy relating to software-as-a-service (SaaS) configuration and customisation costs to align with the clarified guidance
within the IFRIC agenda decision released in April 2021. This has resulted in adjustments to reduce other intangible assets in previous periods (see note 1.1 for
further details).

Goodwill
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s operating segments which represent the lowest level at which it is monitored and tested for impairment. It is denominated in
the relevant local currencies and therefore the carrying value is subject to movements in foreign exchange rates.

**3.3** **IMPAIRMENT TESTING**

**Accounting policies**
The carrying amounts of the Group’s goodwill, intangible assets, PPE and right-of-use (ROU) assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether
there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists or if the asset has an indefinite life, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.

The process of impairment testing is to estimate the recoverable amount of the assets concerned, and recognise an impairment loss whenever the carrying amount
of those assets exceeds the recoverable amount. Impairment testing is performed first at the individual cash-generating unit (CGU) level without goodwill, with any
impairment loss recognised as required. Impairment testing for goodwill is then applied to the collection of CGUs to which the goodwill relates.

The level at which the assets concerned are reviewed varies as follows:

Asset

Goodwill Goodwill is reviewed at an Operating Group level, being the relevant grouping of CGUs at which the benefit of such goodwill arises. A
CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates largely independent cash inflows, being the Group’s individual attractions.

Brands Brands are reviewed at an individual CGU level.

PPE PPE is reviewed at an individual CGU level, being the Group's individual attractions.

ROU assets ROU assets are reviewed at an individual CGU level, being the Group's individual attractions. In doing so, the associated lease liability is
considered against the value of the ROU asset as a sale of a CGU would necessitate that a buyer takes on the lease liability.

For assets that are in continuing use but do not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which the
assets belong.

Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill, and then to reduce the carrying
amount of other intangible assets and other assets on a pro rata basis.

**Calculation of recoverable amount**
In accordance with accounting standards the recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. To assess value in use,
estimated future cash flows have been discounted to their present value using pre-tax discount rates, each appropriate to the Operating Group concerned. The
Group’s internally approved five year business plans, where the first year is based on latest budgets, are used as the basis for these calculations, with cash flows
beyond the five year outlook period then extrapolated using long term growth rates.

The key assumptions and estimates used when calculating the net present value of future cash flows from the Group’s businesses are as follows:

Estimate

Future cash flows Assumed to be equivalent to the operating cash flows of the businesses less the cash flows in respect of capital expenditure
and repayments of lease liabilities. The Group uses EBITDA less an allocation of central costs, in line with other recharges
which occur in the business, as a proxy for the operating cash flows of its attractions as they are not significantly impacted
by movements in working capital.

Growth in EBITDA EBITDA is forecast by an analysis of both projected revenues and costs. Visitor numbers and revenue projections are
based on market analysis, including the total available market, historic trends, competition and site development activity,

Estimate


Discount rates to reflect the risks
involved


Based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital of a ‘market participant’ within the main geographical regions
where the Group operates, these are drawn from market data and businesses in similar sectors, and adjusted for asset
specific risks. The key assumptions of the ‘market participant’ include the ratio of debt to equity financing, risk free rates
and the medium term risks associated with equity investments. Five year average figures are used where appropriate to
reduce the impact of any short term volatility. Net present values are calculated using pre-tax discount rates derived from
this post-tax weighted average cost of capital.

|Pre-tax discount rates|Post-tax discount rates|
|---|---|
|2021 2020|2021 2020|


**Sensitivity analysis**
Impairment reviews are often sensitive to changes in key assumptions. Sensitivity analysis has therefore been performed on the calculated recoverable amounts
considering incremental changes in the key assumptions.

Particular focus is given to material amounts where headroom is more limited. This solely relates to goodwill attributed to the LEGOLAND Parks Operating
Group, where the headroom is £87 million (2020: £260 million of impairment losses were made in the year), and the Resort Theme Parks Operating Group where the
headroom is £22 million (2020: £64 million). The Midway Attractions Operating Group and the individual brands show considerable headroom and are not sensitive
to even significant changes in any of the key assumptions.

Individual site assets could have different outcomes for their impairment reviews in future periods, though the only site with impairment triggers identified this year
where this could be material to the Group would be LEGOLAND New York. The Directors do not envisage any short term factors such as the impact of COVID-19
having a longer term impact on the prospects for the resort.

In undertaking sensitivity analysis consideration has been given to movements in forecast EBITDA, increases in discount rates and reductions in long term
growth rates:

- At the reporting date the Directors consider that the forecasts used reflect the best estimate of future trading. It is noted, however, that the calculations are
inherently sensitive to the level of growth as the business recovers from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This can depend on a number of factors. These
include when attractions are open, the level of any social distancing or other governmental restrictions, customer demand, people’s ability to travel across
borders, vaccine roll outs, and the wider economic trading environment. Other more normal factors such as weather patterns can also affect trading. While in
the short term slower growth would be highly unlikely to affect valuations by a substantial amount, longer term shortfalls that affect the outlook for the fifth year
of the plan (which drives the terminal value) would have a more significant impact.

- Discount rates have been derived from market data. As these rates are intended to be long term in nature they are expected to be reasonably stable in the short
term, however market discount rates could increase in future.

- The long term growth rate, which is applied to the cash flows of the final year in the business plan (2026), was determined based on management’s long term
expectations, taking account of historical averages and future expected trends in both market development and market share growth.

LEGOLAND Parks (LLP)

- If EBITDA for LLP as a whole was forecast to be 3% lower than currently anticipated for 2026, headroom would be absorbed in full.

- If the pre-tax discount rate used across LLP had been higher by a factor of 2% to 10.6%, headroom would have been absorbed in full.

- If circumstances caused the long term growth rate to lower from 2.5% to 2.2%, headroom would be absorbed in full.

Resort Theme Parks (RTP)

- If EBITDA for RTP as a whole was forecast to be 1% lower than currently anticipated for 2026, headroom would be absorbed in full.

- If the pre-tax discount rate used across RTP had been higher by a factor of 2% to 10.6%, headroom would have been absorbed in full.

- If circumstances caused the long term growth rate to lower from 2.5% to 2.3%, headroom would be absorbed in full.

**Accounting policies**
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is measured using the first-in first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in
acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their present location and condition. In a business combination the goods for resale held by the acquired Group are
‘stepped-up’ to a value that takes into account an estimation of the level of future sales proceeds to be generated by the acquiring Group, less estimated costs
necessary to sell the inventory.

Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised and carried at the original invoice amount less a loss allowance calculated using the simplified expected credit loss (ECL)
model approach. Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Other receivables are stated at their amortised cost less any
impairment losses. Estimated ECLs are calculated using both actual credit loss experience and forward looking projections.

Deferred income
Deferred income comprises revenues received or invoiced at the reporting date which relate to future periods. The main components of deferred income relate to
advanced ticket revenues in respect of online bookings and annual pass purchases; pre-booked accommodation; and certain sponsorship and similar arrangements.

In 2021, at year end exchange rates, this also includes £50 million (2020: £54 million) received in respect of funding and infrastructure support for the development of
LEGOLAND Korea. Upon the opening of the park in May 2022, this will be accounted for as a capital grant and offset against the total project costs within

**3.5** **PROVISIONS**

**Accounting policy**
Provisions are recognised when the Group has legal or constructive obligations as a result of past events and it is probable that expenditure will be required to settle
those obligations. They are measured at the Directors’ best estimates, after taking account of information available and different possible outcomes.

If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the
time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

Asset retirement provisions
Certain attractions operate on leasehold sites and these provisions relate to the anticipated costs of removing assets and restoring the sites concerned at the end of
the lease term. These leases are typically of a duration of between 10 and 60 years.

They are established on inception and reviewed annually. The provisions are discounted back to present value with the discount then being unwound through the
income statement as part of finance costs. The cost of establishing these provisions together with the impact of any changes in the discount rate is capitalised within
the cost of the related asset.

Other
Other provisions largely relate to future regulatory payments in connection with the modification of the UK Resort Theme Parks leases and agreements that were
entered into to secure their tenure until 2077 (see note 4.4) that may become payable at the start of the additional 35 year period. Remaining balances relate to the
estimated cost arising from open insurance claims, tax matters and legal issues.

There are no anticipated future events that would be expected to cause a material change in the timing or amount of outflows associated with the provisions.

**4.2** **INTEREST-BEARING LOANS AND BORROWINGS**

**Accounting policy**
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less attributable fees. These fees are then amortised through the income statement on an
effective interest rate basis over the expected life of the loan (or over the contractual term where there is no clear indication that a shorter life is appropriate). If the
Group’s estimate of the expected life based on repayment subsequently changes, the resulting adjustment to the effective interest rate calculation is recognised as a
gain or loss on re-measurement and presented separately in the income statement, in accordance with IFRS 9.

Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs and are subsequently stated at amortised cost. Any difference
between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is amortised through the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the
effective interest method. Fixed rate borrowings, which have been hedged to floating rates, are measured at amortised cost adjusted for changes in the value
attributable to the hedged risk arising from the changes in underlying market interest rates.

At 25 December 2021, the Group’s senior facilities are the following:

Senior secured debt

- €1,460 million and $1,358 million drawn facilities to mature in November 2026 entered into by the Company’s subsidiary Motion Finco S.à r.l. The margins on
these facilities are dependent on the Group’s adjusted leverage ratio and at 25 December 2021 were at a margin of 3.0% (2020: 3.0%) for EUR borrowings and
3.25% (2020: 3.25%) for USD borrowings over the floating interest rates when drawn. The relevant floating interest rate is USD LIBOR, which was 0.13% at
25 December 2021 (0.22% at 26 December 2020). No floating rate is added to the EUR borrowings while EURIBOR is negative.

- €500 million of 7.0% senior secured notes due 2025 entered into by the Company’s subsidiary Motion Finco S.à r.l. The notes are listed on The International
Stock Exchange.

- $400 million 5.75% senior notes due 2026 entered into by the Company’s subsidiary Merlin Entertainments Limited. The notes are listed on The International
Stock Exchange.

- A £400 million revolving credit facility to mature in May 2026. £28 million was utilised by way of establishing certain ancillary facilities, including letters of credit.
The relevant floating rate used for the facility was amended on 1 January 2022 from GBP LIBOR to the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA).

Other senior debt

- €370 million 4.5% senior notes due 2027 and $410 million 6.625% senior notes due 2027 entered into by the Company’s subsidiary Motion Bondco DAC. The
notes are listed on The International Stock Exchange.

The terms of the floating rate debt facility require a repayment of 0.25% of the outstanding principal amount of the USD borrowings every three months.

In February 2020 the Group received $173 million under a delayed draw down term facility and in April 2020 it completed the issue of the €500 million of 7.0%
senior secured notes due 2025.

**4.2** **INTEREST-BEARING LOANS AND BORROWINGS (CONTINUED)**

The Group issued £156 million of 0% subordinated unsecured shareholder loan notes in 2019. These were initially recognised at fair value of £150 million with the
difference treated as a capital contribution (see note 4.5). During 2020 the shareholder loans were repaid and the proceeds reinvested in a further issue of new
ordinary and preference shares to the existing shareholders.

Shareholder loans of £15 million in 2020 related to funding from KIRKBI Invest A/S for the deferral of certain payments. These were repaid during 2021.

Other loans of £3 million (2020: £7 million) have been taken out in respect of specific capital projects.

Covenants
A financial covenant has existed from 30 September 2020 but is only required when the revolving credit facility is drawn by 40% or more (net of cash and cash
equivalents). The covenant requires the Group to maintain adjusted consolidated senior secured leverage below 10x. Effective June 2021, the Group agreed with its
revolving facility lenders to waive the leverage covenant until Q3 2023. As part of this agreement the Group is required to maintain a minimum liquidity of £75
million (to include amounts undrawn from the revolving credit facility, and cash and cash equivalents), over the period of the waiver.

The Group complied with the financial covenants in the year. The Group is also required to comply with certain non-financial covenants in these bank facilities and
notes, and these requirements were satisfied throughout the year.

**4.3** **FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT**

**Liquidity risk**
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group would not have sufficient funds to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s Treasury department produces
short term and long term cash forecasts to identify liquidity requirements and headroom, which are reviewed by the Group’s Chief Financial Officer. Surplus cash is
actively managed across Group bank accounts to cover local shortfalls or invested in bank deposits or other short term liquid investments such as money market
funds. In some countries bank cash pooling arrangements are in place to optimise the use of cash. As at 25 December 2021 the Group had £185 million of cash and
cash equivalents (2020: £306 million) and access to a £400 million revolving credit facility, of which £28 million was utilised in 2021 (2020: £29 million) by way of
establishing certain ancillary facilities, including letters of credit, in order to meet its obligations and commitments that will fall due.

The following table sets out the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments. This analysis assumes that interest rates prevailing at the

**Interest rate risk**
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on both interest-bearing assets and liabilities. The Group has a policy of actively managing its interest rate risk exposure
using a combination of fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps.

At 25 December 2021 the Group had £1,340 million of fixed rate debt comprising:

- €500 million of 7.0% notes to mature in 2025;

- $400 million of 5.75% notes to mature in 2026;

- €370 million 4.5% notes to mature in 2027; and

- $410 million 6.625% notes to mature in 2027.

In aggregate 37% (2020: 37%) of the year end interest-bearing loans and borrowings is at a fixed rate for a weighted average period of 5 years (2020: 6 years). If
required, to achieve the desired balance of fixed and floating interest rates across currencies, the Group may use floating to fixed interest rate swaps (which are part
of cash flow hedging relationships) and fixed to floating interest rate swaps (which are part of fair value hedging relationships). At 25 December 2021 the Group had
no interest rate swaps (2020: nil).

Sensitivity analysis
Based on the net debt position as at 25 December 2021 a 100 basis points rise in market interest rates would result in an increase in net interest paid of £14 million
_(2020: £20 million) and a 100 basis points fall in market interest rates would result in an increase in net interest paid of £1 million (2020: increase of £1 million). This_
has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the Group’s variable rate cash, borrowings and derivatives.

**Foreign currency risk**
As the Group operates internationally, the performance of the business is sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s potential currency
exposures comprise transaction and translation exposures. The Group ensures that its net exposure to foreign currency balances is kept to a minimal level by using
foreign currency swaps to exchange balances back into Sterling or by buying and selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary. The fair value of foreign
exchange contracts is the present value of future cash flows and is determined by reference to market rates.

At 25 December 2021 the fair value of foreign currency swap assets was £1 million (2020: £4 million) and of foreign currency swap liabilities was £3 million (2020:
_£1 million), none of which are hedge accounted._

Transaction exposures
The revenue and costs of the Group’s operations are denominated primarily in the currencies of the relevant local territories. Any significant cross-border trading
exposures would be hedged by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.

Translation exposures
The Group’s results, as presented in Sterling, are subject to fluctuations as a result of exchange rate movements. The Group does not hedge this translation
exposure to its earnings but, where material, may carry out net asset hedging by borrowing in the same currencies as the currencies of its operating units or by using
forward foreign exchange contracts. The Group’s debt (excluding lease liabilities) is therefore denominated in Euros, US Dollars and Sterling and at 25 December
2021 d f €2 330 ll d $2 168 ll Th f d f h l f JPY 14 900 ll

**4.3** **FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)**

Gains or losses arise on the retranslation of the net assets of foreign operations at different reporting dates and are recognised within the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income. They will predominantly relate to the retranslation of opening net assets at closing foreign exchange rates, together with the retranslation of
retained foreign profits for the year (that have been accounted for in the consolidated income statement at average rates) at closing rates. Exchange rates for major
currencies are set out below.

Gains or losses also arise on the retranslation of foreign currency denominated borrowings designated as effective net investment hedges of overseas net assets.
These are offset in equity by corresponding gains or losses arising on the retranslation of the related hedged foreign currency net assets. The Group also treats
specific intercompany loan balances, which are not intended to be repaid in the foreseeable future, as part of its net investment. In the event of a foreign entity being
sold or a hedging item being extinguished, such exchange differences would be recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.

The following exchange rates have been used in the translation of the results of foreign operations:

**4.3** **FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)**

Sensitivity analysis on foreign currency risk
A 10% strengthening of all currencies against Sterling would increase net debt by £359 million (2020: £370 million). As described above, gains or losses in the income
statement and equity are offset by the retranslation of the related foreign currency net assets or specific intercompany loan balances.

A 10% strengthening of all currencies against Sterling would reduce the fair value of foreign exchange contracts and result in a charge to the income statement of
£13 million (2020: £21 million).

**Credit risk**
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. Credit risk is
limited to the carrying value of the Group’s monetary assets. The Group has limited credit risk with its customers, the vast majority of whom pay in advance or at
the time of their visit. There are credit policies in place with regard to its trade receivables with credit evaluations performed on customers requiring credit over a
certain amount.

The Group manages credit exposures in connection with financing and treasury activities including exposures arising from bank deposits, cash held at banks and
derivative transactions, by appraisal, formal approval and ongoing monitoring of the credit position of counterparties. Counterparty exposures are measured against a
formal transaction limit appropriate to that counterparty’s credit position. The Group robustly appraises investments before they are made to ensure the associated
credit risk is acceptable. Performance of investments are closely monitored, in some cases through Board participation, to ensure returns are in line with
expectations and credit risk remains acceptable. There were no overdue amounts in respect of investments and no impairments have been recorded (2020: £nil).

**Fair values**
Fair value hierarchy
The Group analyses financial instruments in the following ways:

- Level 1: uses unadjusted quoted prices in active markets.

- Level 2: uses inputs that are derived directly or indirectly from observable prices (other than quoted prices).

- Level 3: uses inputs that are not based on observable market data.

Fair value versus carrying amounts
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are presented in the table below, together with the carrying amounts shown in the statement of financial position.
Short term receivables, payables and cash and cash equivalents have been excluded from the following disclosures on the basis that their carrying amount is a
reasonable approximation to fair value.

**4.3** **FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)**

The fair values shown above for the bank facilities and fixed rate notes have been calculated using market values. The fair value of leases are determined by reference
to incremental borrowing rates that would prevail at the reporting date. There is no difference between the carrying value and the fair value of minority equity
investments. These are accounted for as ‘fair value through other comprehensive income’ and are valued by reference to EBITDA multiples or discounted cash flows,
as appropriate to each investment.

There have been no transfers between levels in 2021 or 2020.

**4.4** **LEASE OBLIGATIONS**

**Accounting policy**
Where a contract provides the right to control the use of an asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration, the contract is accounted for as a lease. In
order for lease accounting to apply, an assessment is made at the inception of the contract that considers whether;

- the Group has the use of an identified asset, which entitles it to the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits that arise from the use of the
asset, and;

- the right to direct the use of the asset, either through the right to operate the asset or by predetermining how the asset is used.

Measurement at lease inception
At the lease commencement date the Group, as the lessee, will recognise;

- a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments, and:

- an asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset (ROU asset).

The lease liability is initially measured as the present value of future lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, or if not available an
incremental borrowing rate. Future lease payments will include fixed payments, variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate (initially measured at the
rate at the commencement date, and subsequently modified as subsequent index or rates changes occur) and amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under
residual value guarantees. In relation to variable lease payments the total lease liability recognised in the statement of financial position includes the impact of any
index or rate changes that have already occurred, but does not include the impact of any future index or rate changes that have not yet taken place.

The ROU asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the amount initially recognised as the lease liability, lease payments made at or before the
commencement date less any lease incentives received, initial direct costs incurred, and the estimated costs to be incurred at the end of the lease to restore the site
to the required condition stipulated in the lease.

In a business combination the ROU assets and lease liabilities for those leases accounted for under IFRS 16 are aligned, except where it is assessed that the cost of
the acquired historic lease commitments taken on are greater or lower than a market participant would expect to pay were equivalent leases being entered into at
the time of the transaction. Where a current market rental is estimated to be higher than that currently paid by the acquired Group, there is an upward adjustment
to the right-of-use asset, or vice-versa if the opposite applies.

On inception of a lease for a new site, where required, the estimated cost of decommissioning any additions is included within ROU assets and depreciated over
the lease term. A corresponding provision is set up as disclosed in note 3.5.

Depreciation (and any subsequent impairment) on the ROU asset, interest on the lease liability and any variable lease payments are all recognised in the
income statement.

Ongoing measurement
After the commencement date the Group measures the ROU asset using a cost model, reducing the cost through depreciation and any impairment losses.
Adjustments will be made to the ROU asset to reflect the changes in the lease liability as a result of changes to lease payments or modifications to the lease.

The lease liability is adjusted for interest on the liability, contractual lease repayments and any reassessment of the lease as a result of a contract modification, such as
changes to the contractual rent amounts, or changes to the term of the lease.

Upon lease modification, the discount rates used in the present value calculations are adjusted to reflect the appropriate rates at the date of modification for the
remaining term of the lease, with resulting adjustments to the liability and ROU asset balances. Discount rates are then not revisited during the remaining life of
the lease.

When a lease is terminated earlier than the contractual end date within the lease agreement, the remaining balances on the lease liability after any final payments due,
the ROU asset gross cost and the ROU asset accumulated depreciation are removed. Any difference between the liability balance removed and the net ROU asset
balance removed are reflected in the income statement.

**4.4** **LEASE OBLIGATIONS (CONTINUED)**

Short term and low-value leases
The Group has taken the recognition exemptions for short term leases and leases of low-value items. Leases which fall within the Group’s defined parameters for
these exemptions are excluded from the IFRS 16 lease accounting requirements and are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Rent reductions and deferrals
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued amendments to IFRS 16 Leases to allow lessees not to
[account for rent concessions as lease modifications if they are a direct consequence of COVID-19 and meet certain conditions. On 31 March 2021 the IASB](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhome.kpmg%2Fxx%2Fen%2Fhome%2Finsights%2F2020%2F03%2Fcovid-19-lease-contracts-09a.html&data=04%7C01%7CJordan.Revitt%40merlinentertainments.biz%7Ce11ed4aafc1d42bb6c6d08d9dc05f0d0%7Ceff87342bf9949a9bfb2655c113e30a4%7C0%7C0%7C637782740333418316%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=LerSVFy1uj7u6e4RKrxAuwQqkEmmQZ6SBdTk2nEwBT4%3D&reserved=0)
extended their amendments to IFRS 16 beyond 30 June 2021. Therefore, as a lessee we have applied the practical expedient for the whole of the financial year and
are not required to assess whether eligible rent concessions are lease modifications. Accordingly, where the Group has agreed concessions in the form of a one-off
reduction in rent, they have been accounted for as a variable lease payment and have been recognised in profit or loss. The total recognised in the income statement
was £1 million (2020: £1 million).

**Lease arrangements**
The Group’s most significant lease arrangements relate to sale and leaseback transactions originally undertaken by the Merlin Group during 2007, involving the PPE of
an attraction within the Midway Attractions Operating Group, located in the United Kingdom, and other attractions within the Resort Theme Parks Operating
Group, located within the United Kingdom and Germany.

Each of these lease agreements was for a period of 35 years from inception until 2042, and allowed for annual rent increases based on the inflationary index in the
United Kingdom and fixed increases in Continental Europe. The Group had the option, but was not contractually required, to extend each of the lease agreements
individually for two further terms of 35 years, to 2077 and then to 2102, subject to an adjustment to market rates at that time. This remains the case for the lease
that relates to the Midway attraction.

At the time of approving these financial statements, the agreements in respect of the Resort Theme Parks leases have been modified and agreements have been
entered into to secure their tenure for an additional 35 years from 2042 to 2077.

For the United Kingdom sites the modification was completed before the end of the reporting period and as a result the relevant balances have been adjusted
accordingly in the 2021 financial statements. The transaction has been treated as a lease modification. It does not meet the criteria to be treated as a separate lease.
The Group did not exercise the lease option unilaterally; instead the Group and the lessor entered into a binding agreement to extend the leases in 2042, and agreed
certain lease changes. As part of these changes the United Kingdom sites are now subject to annual rent increases linked to CPI +0.5% (with a floor of 1%, and a
maximum increase of 4%). Under the previous agreement the sites were subject to RPI based annual upwards only increases without any maximum. The minimum
1% per annum has been reflected in the modification calculation. As part of the transaction the Group received a cash payment of £25 million from the landlord and
will receive a further £3 million within the following year.

For the European site, the terms of the modification were agreed and completed after the end of the reporting period. At the reporting date it was not reasonably
certain that the modification would take place. Accordingly the modification has been reflected as a non-adjusting subsequent event in these financial statements (see
note 5.6), and will be reflected in the 2022 financial statements. As part of the transaction the Group received a payment of £6 million from the landlord after the
end of the reporting period.

At the time of the acquisition of the Merlin Group by the investor consortium in November 2019, it was determined that the implicit rate of interest for these leases
was not readily determinable, and accordingly an incremental borrowing rate (IBR) was used that reflected the Group’s financing arrangements at that time. For the
recent modification the IBR was calculated by reference to the mid yield on a composite index of debt at an appropriate duration and the same (or similar) long term
credit rating as the Company, adjusted where relevant for the sovereign yield for a similar duration to the index being used in the country/geography of that index.

The modification and securing of tenure of the UK sites has resulted in an increase to the lease liability of £149 million. The second extension option from 2077 to
2102 still remains available for the Group to exercise in the future for the United Kingdom and Continental Europe sites.

LEGOLAND Japan was opened during 2017. The park was developed under an ‘operated and leased’ model whereby a local operating company leases the site and
park infrastructure from a development partner. The development partners are related parties, being KIRKBI Invest A/S and LLJ Investco K.K, a subsidiary of KIRKBI
Invest A/S (note 5.3). KIRKBI Invest A/S holds KIRKBI’s investment as a shareholder of the Group. The lease is for a period of 50 years.

The Group also enters into leases for sites within the Midway Attractions Operating Group and central areas. These are typically of a duration between 10 and 60
years, with rent increases determined based on local market practice. In addition to a fixed rental element, rents within the Midway Attractions Operating Group can
also contain a performance related element, typically based on turnover at the site concerned. Options to renew leases exist at these sites in line with local market
practice in the territories concerned.

The key contractual terms in relation to each lease are considered when calculating the rental charge over the lease term. The potential impact on rent charges of
future performance or increases based on inflationary indices are each excluded from these calculations.

**4.4** **LEASE OBLIGATIONS (CONTINUED)**

On certain leases the Group is required to make other contractual rent payments in addition to or instead of any fixed or minimum rent amounts, usually in the
form of rent based on a percentage of the turnover generated by the relevant attraction. These rent payments are outside of the scope of IFRS 16. They are charged
directly to the income statement and do not result in any adjustment to the lease liabilities or ROU assets as they are contingent on performance and as such
there is no future obligation until that performance occurs. As noted below, the expense relating to variable lease payments was £12 million in 2021
_(2020: £6 million)._

There are no significant operating restrictions placed on the Group as a result of its lease arrangements.

In the current year there was no significant impact of the amendments to IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ relating to Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (IBOR). This reform
may impact new leases and future modified leases from 2022 onwards due to the impact benchmark rate changes will have on discount rates used to calculate
lease liabilities.

**Capital management**
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt and equity. The Group’s objective when managing capital is to: maintain a strong capital base so as to ensure
shareholder and creditor confidence and to sustain future development of the business; to provide returns for shareholders; and to optimise the capital structure to
reduce the cost of capital. There are no externally imposed capital requirements on the Group.

To enable the Group to meet its objective, the Merlin Board monitor returns on capital through constant review of earnings generated from the Group’s capital
investment programme and through regular budgeting and planning processes, manage capital in a manner so as to ensure that sufficient funds for capital investment
and working capital are available, and ensure that the requirements of the Group’s debt covenants are met.

_Issue of shares_
The nominal value of shares in issue is shown in share capital, with any additional consideration for those shares shown in share premium.

_Ordinary shares_
During 2020 the Company issued 2,957,123 ordinary shares at a nominal value of one pence each, for consideration of £13 million, for general corporate purposes.

The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time.

Each ordinary share entitles the holder of that ordinary share to receive notice of and to attend and to speak and to vote at general meetings of the Company (on
the basis of one vote per ordinary share), or on any resolution proposed to members as a written resolution. Each ordinary share in the capital of the Company
ranks equally in all respects and no shareholder holds shares carrying special rights relating to the control of the Company.

_Preference shares_
During 2020 the Company issued 292,755,102 6% fixed cumulative preference shares at a nominal value of one pence each for a consideration of £293 million. In
accordance with the accounting policy as set out in note 1.1, these have been classed as equity.

The preference shares earn a fixed, cumulative, preferential dividend at the rate of 6% per annum on the issue price of the preference shares, which accrues (but is
not payable) on each preference share on a daily basis from the date of issue of the relevant preference share, and ends on the day preceding the redemption date,
compounding annually on each anniversary of the compounding date.

The preference shares rank ahead of the ordinary shares for all purposes and no dividend, distribution, return of capital and/or reduction of capital is paid on the
ordinary shares until the preference shares have been redeemed in full.

Each preference share entitles the holder of that preference share to receive notice of and to attend and to speak and to vote at general meetings of the Company
(on the basis of one vote per preference share), or on any resolution proposed to members as a written resolution.

Capital reserve
During 2019, the Group issued £156 million 0% subordinated unsecured shareholder loan notes due 31 October 2020.

In accordance with the accounting policy as set out in note 1.1, these were classed as financial liabilities. Reflecting the off-market interest rate attached to these loan
notes, these were initially recognised at fair value of £150 million with the difference of £6 million treated as a capital contribution (see note 4.2). The capital reserve
has been eliminated through retained earnings in the year.

Dividends
Dividends are recognised through equity on the earlier of their approval by the Company’s shareholders or their payment. The Directors of the Company have
declared their intention not to pay a dividend for the year ended 25 December 2021 (2020: £nil).

Translation reserve
The translation reserve of £(17) million (2020 as restated: £(63) million) comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial
statements of foreign operations The reporting date foreign exchange rates by major currency are provided in note 4 3

Reserve for own shares
In the year, the Group granted three employee share incentive plans relating to the Company’s subsidiary Motion TopCo Limited (see note 4.6). Preference B shares,
ordinary B shares and ordinary C shares of the subsidiary were issued to senior management and other employees in exchange for consideration. The total employee
investment was £4,362,865 with the nominal value of the shares subscribed for being £108,019 (2020: £nil). Upon the vesting date of the incentive plans, employees
will hold a non-controlling interest in Motion TopCo Limited of 0.16%. Until vesting, Motion TopCo Limited recognises these as treasury shares that result in a
reduction to equity; this reduction is eliminated on consolidation.

3,650,900 of the shares issued to employees as part of the share incentive plans are held in an employee benefit trust, with a nominal value of £36,509. The Group
does not have control of these shares or the trust; as such the shares are not treated as treasury shares and the trust is not consolidated into the Group.

**4.6** **SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS**

**Accounting policy**
The fair value of share plans is recognised as an expense over the expected vesting period with a corresponding entry to either share-based payment liabilities for
both cash-settled plans and cash-settled elements relating to compound instruments, or retained earnings for equity-settled plans and equity-settled elements relating
to compound instruments. All entries are net of deferred tax. The fair value of share plans is determined at the date of grant. The fair value of awards granted is
measured based on observable market data, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which awards were granted. For all cash-settled awards and cashsettled elements relating to compound instruments, the fair value is re-measured at each accounting date up to the vesting date by applying an option pricing model.
Non-market based performance conditions (including most likely exit events) are taken into account for all plans in estimating the number of awards likely to vest,
which is reviewed at each accounting date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual awards issued. No adjustment is made
after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or are not exercised.

**Analysis of awards**
The Group operates three employee share incentive plans:

- Senior Management Long Term Bonus plan (LTB)

- Senior Management Equity Investment (EI)

- Management Share Scheme (MSS)

In the year, the Group issued share awards to employees, with all plans being in respect of the Company’s subsidiary entity Motion Topco Limited. Some of these
share awards issued are held in an employee benefit trust (see note 4.5).

The total charge for the year for all plans is less than £1 million, and at the reporting date, liabilities in respect of share-based payment transactions in the year are
also less than £1 million.

**4.6** **SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)**

Senior Management Long Term Bonus plan (LTB)
The LTB plan was granted on 11 November 2021 to eligible employees. The designated individuals of the plan are entitled to a gross cash bonus corresponding in
aggregate to an amount equal to 0.75% of the equity value of Motion Topco Limited upon vesting, which is expected to occur upon an interim trigger event. The cash
payment is based on the value of equity instruments of Motion Topco Limited (there are no equity settlement alternatives) and continuity of service, and hence falls
in scope to be cash-settled.

The fair value of this award is estimated at £15 million following consideration of future uncertainties and the volatility of business values, and it could change in
future years should the value of the Group rise over time. As the award is cash-settled, valuations calculating the expected fair value of awards are reperformed on
an annual basis.

Senior Management Equity Investment (EI)
The Senior Management Equity Investment (EI) plan was granted from Motion Topco Limited on 11 November 2021 following eligible employee investment of £0.84
per preference B share and £0.279 per ordinary B share, resulting in 4,630,182 preference B shares and 140,769 ordinary B shares being issued. The eligible
employee investment for the EI plan varies in comparison to the Management Share Schemes (MSS) as the awards are a different share category (B shares versus
ordinary C shares awarded in MSS schemes). The preference shares carry a right to a discretionary fixed, cumulative preferential dividend of 4% per annum, which
accrues (but is not payable) on each preference share on a daily basis from 1 April 2021. Payment of these dividends is at the discretion of the Board of Motion
Topco Limited. Accordingly, these awards have been classified as equity and hence fall under the scope of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’.

There is a put option for cash on up to 100% of the shares at fair market value, exercisable at the expected vesting date, which is the earlier of the interim trigger
event or exit. Hence, the interim trigger event has been used to estimate the vesting period of the plan. The option is subject to non-market based performance
conditions, being exit events which create obligations on the Group, and continuity of employment. Individuals with continued employment until exit will retain
shares to the extent the put option is not exercised; hence, the potential appreciation of value of the EI plan is treated as a compound instrument.

The weighted average fair value per award at the measurement date is £nil as the expected value at vesting based on current valuations is less than the amount paid.
This is due to the valuation of preference shares being significantly lower than that of the ordinary shares.

Management Share Scheme (MSS)
The MSS’s are accounted for as part equity-settled, part cash-settled and part compound instruments. MSS plans were granted for senior management and other
employees on 11 November 2021 and 23 December 2021 respectively following eligible employee investment of £0.072 per ordinary C share in Motion Topco
Limited. This resulted in the issuance of 6,030,900 ordinary C shares (2,380,000 of which were allocated to senior management on 11 November 2021) and 516,500
awards which entitle the employee to a cash payment equivalent to the fair value of a notional number of shares upon vesting. All such awards are classified as cashsettled. 3,452,600 awards remain unissued and unallocated. Prior to an exit event all unallocated awards must be allocated; the Group has exercised its judgement
and assumed that all will be allocated before an interim trigger event. Hence, the total value of the MSS awards will always be equal to 10,000,000 shares regardless
of staff attrition over the vesting period. The value of 10,000,000 share awards has therefore been considered when calculating the fair value of the MSS plans. Whilst
in the case of the senior management issues, the Board has retained some flexibility on the terms of settlement, it has exercised its judgement to conclude there is
sufficient parity between MSS awards granted to both senior management and other employees to account for both plans in the same manner.

For MSS share awards, from December 2021 onwards, 12% per annum of the total award becomes eligible for cash-settlement at the expected vesting date, with the
maximum cash-settlement crystallising at 60% in December 2025 of the total value of the MSS share awards. For the purposes of calculating the accounting entries,
an interim trigger event in 2025 has been assumed to be the most likely vesting date; therefore the full 60% is assumed to become eligible for cash-settlement ('the
cash settlement option'). Should the interim trigger event occur at an earlier date the number of MSS share awards eligible for cash settlement decreases.

The 60% of MSS share awards which have a cash settlement option are subject to a put option; this option requires Motion JVco Limited to purchase the shares at
fair market value for cash upon exercise at an interim trigger event. If the put option is not exercised, ordinary C shares in Motion Topco Limited would be retained
by the employee and hence 60% of MSS share awards issued are treated as compound instruments. The equity component of the instrument is deemed to have an
expected value of £nil at vesting (as the expected benefit relating to this portion of the award is identical to the expected cash benefit), and hence the entire sharebased payment expense relating to 60% of MSS share awards issued relate to expected cash-settlement.

For the remaining 40% of MSS share awards issued, should the put option requiring Motion JVco Limited to purchase the other 60% at fair market value for cash be
exercised, the employee’s ordinary C shares would automatically convert to EI ordinary and preference B shares in quantities equivalent to fair market value at point
of exercise. If the put option is not exercised, ordinary C shares in Motion Topco Limited would be retained by the employee and would no longer be the obligation
of the Group to settle. The awards are therefore treated as equity-settled and employees would receive the benefit of these shares at a final exit event following an
interim trigger event, assuming continuity of service. The estimated fair value per award at final exit is lower than at an interim trigger event due to the increased
uncertainty surrounding a longer time horizon. Amounts due to tax authorities in respect of shares issued are the obligation of the employee to settle. Taxes due on
cash bonus awards, equivalent to the value of a notional number of shares, will be settled via payroll.

Should the employee leave service after an interim trigger event but prior to a final exit event, they will receive a cash-settlement equivalent to the fair market value
of their converted EI shares at the date of leaving (or the lower of cost and fair market value if the individual is a competing leaver). Historic attrition data for all
levels of management has been reviewed in approximating the proportions of the 40% MSS awards that will be either equity or cash settled.

The key assumptions in calculating the share-based payments were as follows:

- The Monte-Carlo option pricing model was used to value all plans at the date of grant.

- The expected volatility is based on broadly comparable quoted companies and takes into account the expected life of the relevant award.

- The risk-free rate is equal to the prevailing UK Gilts rate at grant date, which is commensurate with the expected term.

- Expected dividend yield assumes that preference shares will roll forward any accrued dividend on the basis that distributions are discretionary. Therefore,
dividend yield is assumed to be 0.0%.

- The grant date has been determined for each plan following consideration of when there was mutual understanding between the Group and the employee on
the plan’s key terms; this date has been deemed to be the date of share issuance.

- The Group has exercised its judgement to conclude there is sufficient parity between MSS awards granted to both senior management and other employees to
account for both schemes in the same manner.

**5.1** **INVESTMENTS**

**Accounting policy**
The Group holds investments in two forms.

Minority equity investments are accounted for as ‘fair value through other comprehensive income’ (FVOCI), having taken the election available under IFRS 9
‘Financial instruments’. This applies to the investments in IDR Resorts Sdn. Bhd., Gangwon Jungdo Development Corporation Ltd, Shanghai LEGOLAND Co., Ltd
and Big Bus Tours Group Holdings Limited.

Associates and joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control or significant influence, established by contractual agreement. The
consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the total recognised income and expenses on an equity accounted basis, from the date that joint
control or influence commences until the date that it ceases.

**Minority equity investments**
IDR Resorts
The Group has a minority equity investment in IDR Resorts Sdn. Bhd. (IDR). IDR and its subsidiaries are deemed to be related parties as together they own
LEGOLAND Malaysia (see note 5.3).

Gangwon Jungdo Development Corporation
The Group has a minority equity investment in Gangwon Jungdo Development Corporation Ltd, the local company providing funding and infrastructure support to
the development of LEGOLAND Korea (see note 5.3).

Shanghai LEGOLAND Co.
The Group has a minority equity investment in Shanghai LEGOLAND Co., Ltd., the company developing the LEGOLAND Shanghai Resort.

Big Bus Tours
The Group has an investment in Big Bus Tours Group Holdings Limited (BIG BUS), held substantially all in the form of loan notes. The investment is valued adopting
a market-based approach (based on EBITDA multiples). The BIG BUS city tour business is heavily reliant on international tourists visiting city centre locations, and
therefore has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, BIG BUS raised further funding and completed a capital restructuring exercise during
2020 whereby the priority of the Group’s investment reduced compared to other investors. Accordingly a negative adjustment of £39 million to the fair value was
reflected in 2020 taking the value to £nil. Should the business prove successful in its planned recovery, positive value adjustments could occur in the future.

The Group also holds a minority equity investment valued at £nil (2020: £nil).

**Investments in associates and joint ventures**
LL Dubai Hotel
The Group holds a 40% equity interest in LL Dubai Hotel LLC. This is the company that developed the hotel at LEGOLAND Dubai, which opened in January 2022.
The negative share of reserves reflects pre-opening costs for the hotel.

**5.2** **EMPLOYEE BENEFITS**

**Accounting policies**
Defined contribution pension schemes
In the case of defined contribution schemes, the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate fund on behalf of the employee and has no further obligations to
them. The risks and rewards associated with this type of scheme are assumed by the members rather than the employer. Obligations for contributions to defined
contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.

**5.2** **EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONTINUED)**

Defined benefit pension schemes
A defined benefit scheme is a post-employment benefit scheme other than a defined contribution scheme. The Group’s net obligation is calculated for each scheme
by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to
determine its present value and offset by the fair value of any scheme assets. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit
method. All actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the period they occur directly in equity through other comprehensive income.

**Defined contribution pension schemes**
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes and the total expense relating to those schemes in the current year was £11 million
_(2020: £11 million)._

**Defined benefit pension schemes**
The principal scheme that the Group operates is a closed scheme for certain former UK employees of The Tussauds Group, which was acquired by the Merlin
Group in 2007. The scheme entitles retired employees to receive an annual payment based on a percentage of final salary for each year of service that the employee
provided. The pension schemes have not directly invested in any of the Group’s own financial instruments or in properties or other assets used by the Group.

The most recent full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2018. As a result, it was agreed to pay annual deficit reduction
contributions of £497,800, increasing at 3% per annum, payable monthly for a period of 4 years and 8 months from 1 January 2020 to 31 August 2024. An actuarial
valuation as at 31 December 2021 is in progress.

The Group expects £1 million in ongoing contributions to be paid to its defined benefit schemes in 2022. The weighted average duration of the defined benefit
obligation at 25 December 2021 was 17 years (2020: 17 years).

The assets and liabilities of the schemes are:

**5.2** **EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONTINUED)**

The amount recognised in the income statement was £nil (2020: £nil). The amount recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income was a profit of
£3 million (2020: a loss of £4 million).

Actuarial assumptions
Principal actuarial assumptions (expressed as weighted averages) at the year end were:


2021 2020


Discount rate 1.8% 1.5%

Rate of price inflation 3.5% 3.1%

The scheme is closed to future accrual for active members and therefore there is no link to future salary increases.

Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on published statistics and mortality tables. For the Tussauds Group scheme the actuarial table used is S2PxA. The
mortality assumption adopted predicts that a current 65 year old male would have a life expectancy to age 87 and a female would have a life expectancy to age 89.

**5.3** **RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

**Identity of related parties**
The Group has related party relationships with its shareholders (and their connected parties); key management personnel; joint ventures; and other co-investors.

The defined benefit pension scheme for certain former UK employees of The Tussauds Group is also a related party (see note 5.2).

**Transactions with shareholders (and connected parties)**

acts under the direction of the Gangwon Province and is providing funding and infrastructure support of KRW 80 billion (£50 million, at 2021 year end exchange
rates) to the development of LEGOLAND Korea, which the Group has committed to spend on costs associated with the project. All of these funds had been
received by 25 December 2021 and are recorded within deferred income. Upon the opening of the park, the funding and infrastructure support will be accounted for
as a capital grant and offset against the total project costs within property, plant and equipment. The conditions of the funding require that the Group completes the

**5.4** **NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS**

Amendments to IFRS 16 ‘COVID-19 - related rent concessions beyond 30 June 2021’ was implemented in the year, the impact of which is covered in note 4.4.

The following amendments to standards and interpretations have been implemented in the year with no significant impact to the Group:

- Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 ‘Interest rate benchmark reform – Phase 2’

The IASB has also issued the following amendments to standards that will be effective for the Group for the 2022 reporting period. The Group does not expect any
significant impact on its consolidated financial statements from these amendments.

- Amendments to IAS 37 ‘Onerous contracts – cost of fulfilling a contract’

- Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020

- Amendments to IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment - proceeds before intended use’

- Amendments to IFRS 3 ‘Reference to Conceptual Framework’

In April 2021, the IFRS Interpretations Committee published guidance in relation to the capitalisation of costs relating to configuration or customisation of application
software under software-as-a-service arrangements. See note 1.1 for further details of the impact on these financial statements.

**5.5** **ULTIMATE PARENT COMPANY INFORMATION**

The largest group in which the results of the Company are consolidated is that headed by the Company, incorporated in the United Kingdom. No other group
financial statements include the results of the Company.

The consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries are available to the public by visiting the Merlin corporate website at
**www.merlinentertainments.biz.**

**5.6** **SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**

**Lease arrangements**
As stated in note 4.4, terms for the extension to 2077 and certain modifications of the leases at the Continental Europe site were not agreed until after the end of
the reporting period. As such this transaction has been treated as a non-adjusting event as it is indicative of a condition that arose after the end of the reporting
period and therefore does not result in adjustment to the financial statements.

Under the extension agreement the leases at this site will continue to be subject to fixed annual rent increases, and these have been reflected in the modification
calculation. The extension will result in a modification to the associated leases with an increase to the lease liability of £95 million, to be recognised in 2022.

The incremental borrowing rate (IBR) for the leases at this site has been calculated on the same basis as that described for the United Kingdom sites in note 4.4.

**Business combinations**
In January 2022 the Group entered into an agreement to take over the operations of the Cadbury World attraction in the UK. The transaction is expected to
complete within the next year once all conditions precedent have been satisfied. As part of the agreement, the Group will be responsible for the day to day running
of the Cadbury World site, its employees, and all operational decisions, as well as holding brand usage rights for Cadbury World in the UK. The financial impact of
the transaction is not expected to be material to the Group.

# COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

52 weeks ended 25 December 2021 (2020: 52 weeks ended 26 December 2020)

**i** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

Motion JVco Limited (the Company) is a private company limited by shares which is incorporated in the United Kingdom. Its registered office is Link House, 25 West
Street, Poole, Dorset, BH15 1LD.

The principal activity of the Company is to act as a holding company.

These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101).

In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of international accounting standards in
conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with Companies Act 2006 and has set
out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.

The consolidated financial statements of Motion JVco Limited are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and are available to the
public and may be obtained by visiting the Merlin corporate website at www.merlinentertainments.biz. Company financial statements have been prepared and
approved by the Directors in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

In these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:

- Cash flow statement and related notes;

- Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries;

- Disclosures in respect of capital management;

- The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs;

- Disclosures in respect of the compensation of key management personnel.

As the consolidated financial statements of Motion JVco Limited include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under FRS 101
available in respect of certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’ and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial instrument disclosures’.

The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements.

These financial statements have been prepared for the 52 weeks ended 25 December 2021 (2020: 52 weeks ended 26 December 2020).

A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is set out below.

**Investments in subsidiaries**
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, less provision for impairment. The carrying amount of the Company’s investments in subsidiaries is reviewed annually to
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the investment’s recoverable amount is estimated. If the carrying value of the
investment exceeds the recoverable amount, the investment is considered to be impaired and is written down to the recoverable amount. The impairment loss is
recognised in the income statement.

**Foreign currency**
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains
and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.

**Taxation**
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to items recognised directly in
equity, when it is recognised directly in equity, or when it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income, when it is recognised through the statement
of comprehensive income.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, and any
adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.

Deferred tax is provided on certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and taxation purposes
respectively. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither
accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent that they will
probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount
of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.

After considering forecast future profits, deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those assets
can be utilised.

**i** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Classification of financial instruments issued by the Company**
Financial instruments are recognised on the statement of financial position when the Company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The
accounting policy for each type of financial instrument is included within the relevant note.

Financial assets are initially measured at fair value, unless otherwise noted, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive
income or fair value through profit or loss. A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or the Company
transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.

Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, plus, in the case of other financial liabilities, directly attributable transaction costs. Other financial liabilities,
primarily the Company’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings, are measured at amortised cost. Financial liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss
and are held on the statement of financial position at fair value. A financial liability is derecognised when the Company’s obligations are discharged, expire or are
cancelled. Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance costs.

An equity instrument is any contract that has a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. Finance payments associated with
financial instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity. The preference shares issued by the Company carry a fixed,
cumulative, preferential dividend which accrues (but is not payable) on each preference share on a daily basis from the date of issue of the relevant preference share.
Payment of these dividends is at the discretion of the Company and accordingly they have been classified as equity.

Where financial instruments consist of a combination of debt and equity, the Company will assess the substance of the arrangement in place and decide how to
attribute values to each taking into consideration the policy definitions above.

**Dividends**
Dividends are recognised through equity on the earlier of their approval by the Company’s shareholders or their payment.

**ii** **OPERATING EXPENSES**

**Staff numbers and costs**
The average number of persons employed by the Company during the year was seven (2020: seven), being the Directors of the Company.

The employment costs of the Directors of the Company have been borne by other Group companies for their services to the Group as a whole. The costs related
to these Directors are included within note 2.1 of the consolidated financial statements.

**Auditor’s remuneration**
Fees paid to Ernst & Young LLP for audit and other services to the Company are not disclosed in its individual accounts as the Group accounts are required to
disclose such fees on a consolidated basis (note 2.1 of the consolidated financial statements).

Issue of shares
The nominal value of shares in issue is shown in share capital, with any additional consideration for those shares shown in share premium.

Ordinary shares
During 2020 the Company issued 2,957,123 ordinary shares at a nominal value of one pence each, for consideration of £13 million, for general corporate purposes.

The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time.

Each ordinary share entitles the holder of that ordinary share to receive notice of and to attend and to speak and to vote at general meetings of the Company (on
the basis of one vote per ordinary share), or on any resolution proposed to members as a written resolution. Each ordinary share in the capital of the Company
ranks equally in all respects and no shareholder holds shares carrying special rights relating to the control of the Company.

Preference shares
During 2020 the Company issued 292,755,102 6% fixed cumulative preference shares at a nominal value of one pence each for a consideration of £293 million. In
accordance with the accounting policy as set out in note i, these were classed as equity.

The preference shares earn a fixed, cumulative, preferential dividend at the rate of 6% per annum on the issue price of the preference shares, which accrues (but is
not payable) on each preference share on a daily basis from the date of issue of the relevant preference share, and ends on the day preceding the redemption date,
compounding annually on each anniversary of the compounding date.

The preference shares rank ahead of the ordinary shares for all purposes and no dividend, distribution, return of capital and/or reduction of capital is paid on the
ordinary shares until the preference shares have been redeemed in full.

Each preference share entitles the holder of that preference share to receive notice of and to attend and to speak and to vote at general meetings of the Company

**iv** **EQUITY (CONTINUED)**

**Capital reserve**
During 2019 the Company issued £156 million 0% subordinated unsecured shareholder loan notes due 31 October 2020. In accordance with the accounting policy as
set out in note i, these were classed as financial liabilities. Reflecting the off-market interest rate attached to these loan notes, these were initially recognised at fair
value of £150 million with the difference treated as a capital contribution.

During 2020 the shareholder loans were repaid and the proceeds reinvested in a further issue of new ordinary and preference shares to the existing shareholders.

The capital reserve has been eliminated through retained earnings in the year.

**Dividends**
Dividends are recognised through equity on the earlier of their approval by the Company’s shareholders or their payment. The Directors of the Company have
declared their intention not to pay a dividend for the year ended 25 December 2021 (2020: £nil).

**Retained earnings**
The profit after tax for the year in the accounts of Motion JVco Limited is £nil (2020: loss of £4 million).
