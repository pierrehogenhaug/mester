Such a finding might occur if the guarantor, among other things: - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the incurrence of such guarantee; - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence; - incurred the guarantee with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the relevant guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of a guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware that the relevant guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant guarantee; - was engaged in a business or transaction for which the guarantor’s remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they fall due. In addition, any payment by that guarantor pursuant to its guarantee could be voided and required to be returned to the guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the creditors of the guarantor. The measures of insolvency for purposes of these laws will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer, a transfer at undervalue, a conveyance or a voidable preference has occurred and case law interpreting these tests is not uniform. Generally, however, a guarantor would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets; - if the present fair saleable value of its assets were less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, as they become due; - it could not pay or has not paid its debts or obligations as they generally become due; or - it has ceased paying its current obligations in the ordinary course of business as they generally become due. ----- To the extent a court voids any Subsidiary Guarantor’s guarantee of the Notes as a fraudulent transfer, preference or conveyance or holds it unenforceable for any other reason, holders of the Notes would cease to have a direct claim against the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor. In the event that any guarantee is declared invalid or unenforceable as to any Subsidiary Guarantor, in whole or in part, the Notes would be, to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability, effectively subordinated to all liabilities of such Subsidiary Guarantor. The Subsidiary Guarantors’ guarantee of the Notes will contain a provision intended to limit each Subsidiary Guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Subsidiary Guarantor. Moreover, this provision may not be effective to protect a Subsidiary Guarantor’s guarantee from being voided under fraudulent conveyance laws.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, Iron Mountain will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment Notes or portions thereof tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee or the paying agent the Notes so accepted together with an Officers’ Certificate stating the Notes or portions thereof tendered to Iron Mountain. The paying agent will promptly deliver to each Holder so accepted the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate, subject to the provisions of the Indenture, and deliver to each such Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. ----- Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture will not contain provisions that permit Holders to require that Iron Mountain repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar restructuring, nor does it contain any other “event risk” protections for Holders. Although the Change of Control provision may not be waived by Iron Mountain, and may be waived by the Trustee only in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, there can be no assurance that any particular transaction (including a highly leveraged transaction) cannot be structured or effected in a manner not constituting a Change of Control. The Credit Agreement may limit the right of Iron Mountain to purchase any Notes prior to their scheduled maturity. Also, a Change of Control may cause a default under the Credit Agreement. Any future credit agreements or other agreements to which Iron Mountain becomes a party may contain similar restrictions and provisions. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when Iron Mountain is prohibited from purchasing Notes, Iron Mountain could seek a waiver of the default under the Credit Agreement or the consent of its lenders to the purchase of Notes, or Iron Mountain could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If Iron Mountain does not obtain such waiver or consent, or repay such borrowings, Iron Mountain would remain prohibited from purchasing Notes and Iron Mountain would be in default under the Credit Agreement. In such case Iron Mountain’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would, in turn, constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. Iron Mountain will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by Iron Mountain and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer; (ii) in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control, Iron Mountain or any third party has made an offer to purchase (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all Notes validly tendered at a cash price equal to or higher than the Change of Control Payment price and has purchased all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Alternate Offer; or (iii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of the Indenture, unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. In connection with any Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such offer and Iron Mountain, or any other Person making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of Iron Mountain, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, Iron Mountain or such other Person will have the right (in their sole discretion), upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 10 days after such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding after such purchase at a redemption price in cash equal to the price offered to each other Holder of Notes in such offer, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to, but not including, the date of redemption, subject to the right of Holders of record of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of Iron Mountain. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a Holder to require Iron Mountain to repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of Iron Mountain to another Person or group may be uncertain. Asset sales._ Iron Mountain will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to: (1) sell, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of any assets (including by way of a Sale and Leaseback Transaction, but excluding a Qualifying Sale and Leaseback Transaction) other than (a) the sale, lease or other transfer of real estate, products, inventory, services or accounts receivable in the ordinary course ----- of business and any sale or other disposition of damaged, worn-out or obsolete assets in the ordinary course of business (including the abandonment or other disposition of intellectual property that is, in the reasonable judgment of Iron Mountain, no longer economically practicable to maintain or useful in the conduct of the business of Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries taken as whole), (b) licenses and sublicenses by Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary of software or intellectual property in the ordinary course of business, (c) any surrender or waiver of contract rights or settlement, release, recovery on or surrender of contract, tort or other claims in the ordinary course of business, (d) the granting of Liens not prohibited by the covenant described below under the caption “—Certain covenants—Liens” or (e) the sale or other disposition of cash or Cash Equivalents (provided that the sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Iron Mountain will be governed by the provisions of the Indenture described above under the caption “—Repurchase at the option of Holders—Change of control” and/or the provisions described below under the caption “—Certain covenants—Merger, consolidation or sale of assets” and not by the provisions of this covenant); or (2) issue or sell Equity Interests of any Restricted Subsidiary, that, in the case of either clause (1) or (2) above, whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions: (A) has a Fair Market Value in excess of $10.0 million; or (B) results in Net Proceeds in excess of $10.0 million (each of the foregoing, an “Asset Sale”), unless (x) Iron Mountain (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of and (y) at least 75% of the consideration therefor received by Iron Mountain or such Restricted Subsidiary in the Asset Sale and all other Asset Sales since the Issue Date on a cumulative basis is in the form of (i) cash, (ii) Cash Equivalents, (iii) like-kind assets, (iv) other assets used in or useful in Iron Mountain’s business or (v) Designated Non-Cash Consideration having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (B)(y)(v) that is at the time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (i) $50.0 million and (ii) 1.0% of Consolidated Total Assets as of the date of such Asset Sale (in each case as determined in good faith by Iron Mountain); _provided, however, that the amount of any liabilities (as shown on Iron Mountain’s or such Restricted_ Subsidiary’s most recent balance sheet or in the notes thereto) of Iron Mountain or such Restricted Subsidiary (other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or any Note Guarantee) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets, and any notes, securities or other obligations received by Iron Mountain or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by Iron Mountain or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash (to the extent of the cash received) or Cash Equivalents within 180 days of such Asset Sale, shall be deemed to be cash for purposes of this provision; and provided, further, that the 75% limitation referred to in the foregoing clause (B)(y) shall not apply to any Asset Sale in which the cash portion of the consideration received therefrom is equal to or greater than what the after-tax proceeds would have been had such Asset Sale complied with the aforementioned 75% limitation. For the avoidance of doubt, a disposition that constitutes a Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment will be governed by the provisions of the Indenture described below under the covenant entitled “—Certain covenants—Restricted payments” and not by the provisions of this covenant. A transfer of assets or issuance of Equity Interests by Iron Mountain to a Restricted Subsidiary or by a Restricted Subsidiary to Iron Mountain or to another Restricted Subsidiary will not be deemed to be an Asset Sale. Within 365 days of any Asset Sale, Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary may, at its option, apply an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale either: (1) to repay (a) Indebtedness and other obligations that are secured by a Lien or (b) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary other than a Guarantor; ----- (2) to an investment in another business or capital expenditure or to other long-term assets, in each case, in the same line of business as Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary is then engaged in businesses similar or reasonably related thereto; (3) (a) to repay, prepay, redeem or purchase the Notes or (b) to repay other Indebtedness of Iron Mountain or a Subsidiary Guarantor that ranks pari passu in right of payment with the Notes or any Note Guarantee, as applicable, or Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided that, to the extent Iron Mountain elects to repay such Pari Passu Indebtedness, Iron Mountain shall also equally and ratably, at its option, (i) redeem the Notes pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of the Indenture; (ii) offer to reduce Indebtedness under the Notes by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to Holders at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture; or (iii) purchase the Notes through privately negotiated transactions or open market purchases in a manner that complies with the Indenture and applicable securities law at a purchase price of at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest thereon up to the principal amount of Notes to be repurchased; and/or (4) a combination of the repayments and investments permitted by the foregoing clauses (1) through (3). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, Iron Mountain (or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) enters into a binding written agreement irrevocably committing Iron Mountain or such Restricted Subsidiary to an application of funds of the kind described in clause (2) above within 180 days of such contractual commitment (an “Acceptable Commitment”), Iron Mountain or such Restricted Subsidiary shall be deemed not to be in violation of the preceding paragraph so long as such application of funds is consummated within 545 days of the receipt of such Net Proceeds. In the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Net Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds (defined below) unless Iron Mountain or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment within 180 days of such cancellation or termination (a “Second Commitment”) and such Net Proceeds are actually applied in such manner within 180 days from the date of the Second Commitment; provided, further, that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds to the extent 720 days have elapsed since the date of receipt of such Net Proceeds by Iron Mountain or a Restricted Subsidiary. Pending the final application of any such Net Proceeds, Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary may temporarily reduce revolving credit Indebtedness or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture. On the 365th day after an Asset Sale or such earlier date (or a later date if the Company has entered into an Acceptable Commitment as described in the immediately preceding paragraph), if any, as the Board of Directors of Iron Mountain or of such Restricted Subsidiary determines not to apply the Net Proceeds relating to such Asset Sale as set forth in clauses (1) through (4) of the second preceding paragraph, or an Asset Sale Offer Trigger Date, such aggregate amount of Net Proceeds (rounded down to the nearest $1,000) that has not been applied on or before such Asset Sale Offer Trigger Date as permitted in clauses (1) through (4) of the second preceding paragraph or the last provision of this paragraph, or an Asset Sale Offer Amount, shall be applied by Iron Mountain or such Restricted Subsidiary to make an offer to purchase, or an Asset Sale Offer, to all Holders and, to the extent required by the terms of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, to all holders of Pari Passu Indebtedness, on a date, or the Asset Sale Offer Payment Date, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days following the applicable Asset Sale Offer Trigger Date, from all Holders (and holders of any such Pari Passu Indebtedness) on a pro rata basis, the maximum amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness equal to the Asset Sale Offer Amount at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date of purchase. Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries may defer an Asset Sale Offer until there is an aggregate unutilized Asset Sale Offer Amount equal to or in excess of $25.0 million resulting from one or more Asset Sales (at which time, the entire unutilized Asset Sale Offer Amount, and not just the amount in excess of ----- $25.0 million, shall be applied as required pursuant to this covenant). Upon completion of an Asset Sale Offer (including payment for accepted Notes), any surplus Excess Proceeds that were the subject of such offer shall cease to be Excess Proceeds and the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset to zero. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and other Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Asset Sale Offer Amount, Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary may use any remaining Asset Sale Offer Amount for general corporate purposes (including the repurchase of Indebtedness contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes to the extent not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture). If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the Asset Sale Offer Amount, the Trustee shall select the Notes and other Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Notes issued in global form, as discussed under “—Book-entry, delivery and form,” based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate), subject to the Minimum Denomination, unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depositary requirements. Upon completion of such offer to purchase, the Asset Sale Offer Amount shall be reset at zero. Iron Mountain will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer and all other applicable federal and state securities laws. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture, Iron Mountain will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such conflict. The Credit Agreement may limit the right of Iron Mountain or the Restricted Subsidiaries to purchase any Notes prior to their scheduled maturity. Any future credit agreements or other agreements to which Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries becomes a party may contain similar restrictions and provisions. In the event an Asset Sale occurs at a time when Iron Mountain or the Restricted Subsidiaries are prohibited from purchasing the Notes, Iron Mountain could seek the consent of its senior lenders to the purchase of Notes, or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If Iron Mountain does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, Iron Mountain and its Restricted Subsidiaries would remain prohibited from purchasing such Notes. In such case, such failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Credit Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2020,87

Notes of $2,000 or less shall not be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption shall be delivered by first class mail or by electronic means at least 10 but (other than with respect to Notes redeemed in connection with the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture) not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address. Any such redemption or notice may, in Iron Mountain’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, and, if so conditioned, the redemption date for such Notes may be extended by Iron Mountain pending achievement of such condition precedent. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. A new Note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note.

Iron Mountain will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly_ or indirectly: (1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on account of Iron Mountain’s Equity Interests (other than dividends or distributions payable in Equity Interests of Iron Mountain (other than Disqualified Stock)); (2) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests of Iron Mountain; (3) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire prior to the date that is one year prior to the scheduled maturity for value any Indebtedness (excluding any intercompany Indebtedness between or among Iron Mountain and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the Note Guarantees, except a payment of interest or principal at the Stated Maturity thereof; or (4) make any Investment other than a Permitted Investment (all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (1) through (4) above being collectively referred to as “Restricted Payments”); unless, at the time of such Restricted Payment: (i) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof; ----- (ii) other than in respect of Restricted Payments as defined in clause (4) of the definition thereof, Iron Mountain would, at the time of such Restricted Payment, on a Pro Forma Basis, have been permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant entitled “—Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock;” and (iii) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate of all other Restricted Payments made by Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries after October 1, 1996 (excluding Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (2) through (11) of the next succeeding paragraph and any Restricted Payments in respect of the defeasance, redemption, repurchase, retirement or other acquisition or retirement for value of any Indebtedness prior to the date of the Indenture that would have been contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes) would be less than (a) the cumulative EBITDA of Iron Mountain, minus 1.4 times the cumulative Consolidated Interest Expense of Iron Mountain, in each case for the period (taken as one accounting period) from June 30, 1996, to the end of Iron Mountain’s most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment, plus (b) the aggregate net Equity Proceeds received by Iron Mountain from the issuance or sale since October 1, 1996 of Equity Interests of Iron Mountain or of debt securities of Iron Mountain that have been converted into such Equity Interests (other than Equity Interests or convertible debt securities sold to a Restricted Subsidiary and other than Disqualified Stock or debt securities that have been converted into Disqualified Stock), plus (c) an amount equal to the net reduction in Investments since October 1, 1996 (other than reductions in Permitted Investments) in any Person resulting from payments of interest on Indebtedness, dividends, repayments of loans or advances, or other transfers of assets, in each case to Iron Mountain or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or from the net cash proceeds from the sale of any such Investment (except, in each case, to the extent any such payment or proceeds have already been included in the calculation of cumulative EBITDA) or from redesignations of Unrestricted Subsidiaries as Restricted Subsidiaries (valued in each case as provided in the definition of “Investments”) not to exceed, in each case, the amount of Investments previously made by Iron Mountain and its Restricted Subsidiaries in such Person), plus (d) $2.0 million. Assuming that (i) this offering and the application of the net proceeds from this offering as described under “Use of proceeds” and (ii) the application of a portion of the net proceeds from the June 2020 Offering to redeem in full the Senior Subordinated Notes, in each case had been completed on June 30, 2020, the amount that would have been available to Iron Mountain for Restricted Payments pursuant to the foregoing clause (iii) would have been approximately $5.1 billion. The foregoing provisions will not prohibit: (1) the payment of any dividend or the consummation of any irrevocable repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement within 60 days after the date of declaration of the dividend or giving of the notice of repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement, as the case may be, if at the date of declaration or notice, the dividend or repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement would have complied with the provisions of the Indenture; (2) the making of any Restricted Payment in exchange for, or with the net cash proceeds of, the substantially concurrent sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of other Equity Interests of Iron Mountain (other than any Disqualified Stock); provided that the amount of any such net cash proceeds that are utilized for any such Restricted Payment will not be considered to be net Equity Proceeds for purposes of clause (iii)(b) of the first paragraph of this covenant or clause (9) of this paragraph and will not be considered to be net cash proceeds from a Qualified Equity Offering for purposes of the “Optional Redemption” provisions of the Indenture; (3) the defeasance, redemption, repurchase, retirement or other acquisition or retirement for value of Indebtedness that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the Note Guarantees, as applicable (including all accrued interest on the Indebtedness, all accrued and unpaid dividends on Disqualified Stock, and the amount of all penalties, fees, costs, expenses, discounts and premiums incurred in connection therewith and any original issue discount or debt issuance costs with ----- respect thereto), in exchange for, or with the net cash proceeds of, the issuance and sale (other than to Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary) of Refinancing Indebtedness not more than 90 days before or after such defeasance, redemption, repurchase, retirement or other acquisition or retirement for value; (4) the repurchase of any Indebtedness contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the Note Guarantees, as applicable, at a purchase price not greater than 101% of the principal amount of such Indebtedness in the event of a Change of Control in accordance with provisions similar to the “Change of control” covenant; provided that prior to or contemporaneously with such repurchase Iron Mountain has made the Change of Control Offer as provided in such covenant with respect to the Notes and has repurchased all Notes validly tendered for payment in connection with such Change of Control Offer; (5) the purchase, redemption, or other acquisition or retirement of Indebtedness subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or any Note Guarantee (including all accrued interest on the Indebtedness, all accrued and unpaid dividends on Disqualified Stock, and the amount of all penalties, fees, costs, expenses, discounts and premiums incurred in connection therewith and any original issue discount or debt issuance costs with respect thereto) (A) with any Excess Proceeds remaining after completion of an Asset Sale Offer (assuming such Excess Proceeds were not reset at zero) or (B) at a purchase price not greater than 100% of the principal amount of such Indebtedness, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon in the event of Asset Sale, to the extent required by the terms of such Indebtedness; provided that Iron Mountain shall have first complied with its obligations under “—Repurchase at the option of Holders—Asset sales;” (6) the repurchase of Equity Interests deemed to occur upon the exercise of stock options to the extent such Equity Interests represent a portion of the exercise price of those stock options; (7) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the declaration and payment of regularly scheduled or accrued dividends to holders of any class or series of Disqualified Stock of Iron Mountain or any preferred stock of any Restricted Subsidiary issued on or after the date of the Indenture in accordance with the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test described below under the caption “—Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock;” (8) payments of cash, dividends, distributions, advances or other Restricted Payments by Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary to allow for the payment of cash in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares upon (i) the exercise of options or warrants or (ii) the conversion or exchange of Capital Stock of any such Person; (9) additional payments to current or former employees, officers, directors or consultants (or their respective transferees, estates or beneficiaries) of Iron Mountain or any of its Subsidiaries for repurchases of stock, stock options or other equity interests in an aggregate amount up to $5.0 million in any year, with unused amounts in any year permitted to be carried over to succeeding fiscal years; _provided, further, that such amount in any year under this clause may be increased by an amount not to_ exceed: (A) the net cash proceeds from the sale of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of Iron Mountain and, to the extent contributed to Iron Mountain, the net cash proceeds from the sale of Equity Interests of any parent of Iron Mountain, in each case, to any future, current or former employees, officers, consultants or directors of Iron Mountain, any of its Subsidiaries, or any parent of Iron Mountain that occurs after the Issue Date, to the extent the net cash proceeds from the sale of such Equity Interests have not otherwise been applied to the payment of Restricted Payments by virtue of clauses (i)—(iii) of the first paragraph of this covenant or by virtue of clause (2) of this paragraph; plus (B) the cash proceeds of key man life insurance policies received by Iron Mountain or its Restricted Subsidiaries (or by any parent of Iron Mountain to the extent contributed to Iron Mountain) after the Issue Date; minus ----- (C) the amount of any Restricted Payments previously made with the cash proceeds described in the foregoing sub-clauses (A) and (B) of this clause (9); _provided that Iron Mountain may elect to apply all or any portion of the aggregate increase contemplated_ by sub-clauses (A) and (B) above in any twelve-month period; (10) any Restricted Payment so long as after giving effect thereto, the Senior Leverage Ratio would be less than 4.5 to 1.0; and (11) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, other Restricted Payments in an aggregate amount under this clause (11) since the date of the Indenture not to exceed the greater of (x) $275.0 million and (y) 25% of Adjusted EBITDA (determined as of the date of any Restricted Payment pursuant to this clause (11)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Iron Mountain may declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on or in respect of shares of Iron Mountain’s Capital Stock to holders of such Capital Stock, so long as Iron Mountain believes in good faith that it qualifies as a “real estate investment trust” under Section 856 of the Code (or any successor provision) and that the declaration or payment of such dividend or making of such distribution is necessary either (i) to maintain Iron Mountain’s status as a REIT for any taxable year or (ii) to enable Iron Mountain to avoid payment of any tax for any taxable year that could be avoided by reason of paying such dividend or making such distribution by Iron Mountain to its stockholders, with such dividend to be paid or distribution to be made as and when determined by Iron Mountain, whether during or after the end of the relevant taxable year. If an Investment results in the making of a Restricted Payment, the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments deemed to have been made as calculated under the foregoing provision will be reduced by the amount of any net reduction in such Investment (resulting from the payment of interest or dividends, loan repayment, transfer of assets or otherwise) to the extent such net reduction is not included in Iron Mountain’s EBITDA; provided, however, that the total amount by which the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments may be reduced may not exceed the lesser of (a) the cash proceeds received by Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such net reduction and (b) the initial amount of such Investment. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt and to avoid double counting, if an Investment results in the making of a Restricted Payment, then the subsequent assignment, contribution, distribution or other transfer of such Investment by Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Excluded Restricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiary shall not be considered a new Investment or Restricted Payment and shall not further reduce the amount that would otherwise be available for Restricted Payments under clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this section. If the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments calculated under the foregoing provision includes an Investment in an Unrestricted Subsidiary or other Person that thereafter becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, such Investment will no longer be counted as a Restricted Payment for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of Restricted Payments. For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment or Investment (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories described in the third paragraph of this covenant, or is permitted pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first paragraph of this covenant, or pursuant to the definition of “Permitted Investments,” Iron Mountain will be entitled to divide or classify (or later divide, classify or reclassify in whole or in part in its sole discretion) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or, in each case, any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant. For the purpose of making any Restricted Payment calculations under the Indenture: (1) Investments will include the Fair Market Value of the net assets of any Restricted Subsidiary at the time such Restricted Subsidiary is designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary and will exclude the Fair Market Value of the net assets of any Unrestricted Subsidiary that is designated as a Restricted Subsidiary and, for the avoidance of doubt, such inclusions and exclusions will not be limited by the amount of any Investment or aggregate Investments; (2) any asset or property transferred to or from an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be valued at Fair Market Value at the time of such transfer; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Fair Market ----- Value (as so determined) of such asset or property shall be subtracted from (in the case of a transfer to an Unrestricted Subsidiary) or added to (in the case of a transfer from an Unrestricted Subsidiary) the calculation under clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this covenant; and (3) the amount of any Restricted Payment, if other than cash, will be determined by Iron Mountain, whose good faith determination will be conclusive. Iron Mountain’s Board of Directors may designate a Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the covenant entitled “—Designation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Upon such designation, all outstanding Investments by Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid in cash) in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments made at the time of such designation. Such designation will only be permitted if such Restricted Payment would be permitted at such time and if such Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock._ Iron Mountain will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, Guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable with respect to (or, collectively, “incur”) any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) and Iron Mountain will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to issue any shares of preferred stock; provided, however, that Iron Mountain may incur Indebtedness and may permit a Restricted Subsidiary to incur Indebtedness or issue preferred stock if, at the time of such incurrence or issuance and after giving effect thereto on a Pro Forma Basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the four full fiscal quarters immediately preceding such incurrence or issuance for which internal financial statements are available, taken as one period, would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0. The foregoing limitations will not apply to: (1) the incurrence by Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness and letters of credit under Credit Facilities in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding under this clause (1) (with letters of credit being deemed to have a principal amount equal to the maximum potential liability of Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries thereunder) not to exceed $3,260.0 million; (2) the issuance of the Note Guarantees on the date of the Indenture; (3) the incurrence by Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries of the Existing Indebtedness; (4) the issuance of the Notes on the date of the Indenture; (5) the incurrence by Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries of Capital Lease Obligations, mortgage financings and/or Indebtedness constituting purchase money obligations, including all Refinancing Indebtedness incurred with respect thereto, up to an aggregate at any one time outstanding of the greater of (i) $250.0 million and (ii) 5.0% of Consolidated Total Assets as of any date of incurrence; (6) the incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness or preferred stock between (i) Iron Mountain or the Restricted Subsidiaries and (ii) the Restricted Subsidiaries; (7) the incurrence by Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries of Hedging Obligations not for purposes of speculation; (8) the incurrence by Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of performance bonds, bankers’ acceptances, workers’ compensation claims, surety, bid, appeal or similar bonds, completion guarantees, payment obligations in connection with self-insurance or similar obligations, and bank overdrafts (and letters of credit in respect thereof) in the ordinary course of business; (9) the incurrence by Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness consisting of “earn-out” obligations, Guarantees, indemnities or obligations in respect of purchase price adjustments in connection with the acquisition or disposition of assets, including, without limitation, shares of Capital Stock; ----- (10) the incurrence by Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument inadvertently drawn against insufficient funds, so long as such Indebtedness is covered within five business days; (11) the Guarantee by Iron Mountain or any Subsidiary Guarantor of Indebtedness of Iron Mountain or a Restricted Subsidiary and the Guarantee by any non-Guarantor Subsidiary of Indebtedness of another non-Guarantor Subsidiary, in each case, to the extent that the Guaranteed Indebtedness was permitted to be incurred by another provision of this covenant; provided that if the Indebtedness being Guaranteed is contractually subordinated to the Notes or the Note Guarantees, as applicable, then the Guarantee must be subordinated to the same extent as the Indebtedness Guaranteed; (12) the incurrence by Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries of Refinancing Indebtedness issued in exchange for, or the proceeds of which are used to repay, redeem, defease, extend, refinance, renew, replace or refund, Indebtedness (other than intercompany Indebtedness) referred to in clauses (2) through (5) above, this clause (12) or clause (13) below or that was otherwise permitted to be incurred pursuant to the test set forth in the first paragraph of this covenant; (13) the incurrence by Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary of additional Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) at any time outstanding, including all permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (13), not to exceed $50.0 million; (14) Acquired Debt and any other Indebtedness incurred to finance a merger, consolidation or other acquisition; provided that on a Pro Forma Basis, either (A) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would be equal to or greater than the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio immediately prior to such merger, consolidation or other acquisition or (B) Iron Mountain would have been able to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant; (15) Indebtedness the net proceeds of which have been deposited in escrow to finance the repayment or redemption of such Indebtedness pursuant to customary escrow arrangements pending the release thereof; (16) Indebtedness that has been discharged; (17) Indebtedness deemed to exist pursuant to the terms of a Joint Venture agreement as a result of a failure of Iron Mountain or a Restricted Subsidiary to make a required capital contribution therein; _provided that the only recourse on such Indebtedness is limited to Iron Mountain’s or such Restricted_ Subsidiary’s equity interests in the related Joint Venture; (18) (i) Indebtedness representing deferred compensation to employees of Iron Mountain or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries incurred in the ordinary course of business, and (ii) Indebtedness consisting of obligations of Iron Mountain or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries under deferred compensation or other similar arrangements incurred by such Person in connection with any Investment permitted under the covenant described above under the caption “—Restricted payments;” and (19) Indebtedness of Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary in an aggregate principal amount up to 100% of the Equity Proceeds received by Iron Mountain after the Issue Date from the issue or sale of Equity Interests of Iron Mountain or cash contributed to the capital of Iron Mountain (in each case, other than proceeds of Disqualified Stock or sales of Equity Interests to Iron Mountain or any of its Subsidiaries) to the extent such Equity Proceeds have not been applied pursuant to clause (iii)(b) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Restricted Payments,” or clause (2) or clause (9) of the third paragraph of such covenant, to make Restricted Payments, and provided that any such Equity Proceeds shall be excluded for purposes of making Restricted Payments pursuant to any of clause (iii)(b) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Restricted Payments,” or clause (2) or clause (9) of the third paragraph of such covenant, to the extent Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary incur Indebtedness in reliance thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Restricted Subsidiaries that are non-Guarantor Subsidiaries will not be permitted to incur Indebtedness or issue preferred stock pursuant to the first paragraph of this ----- “—Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock” covenant or clause (13) above if, after giving effect to such incurrence or issuance, the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness of such Restricted Subsidiaries that are non-Guarantor Subsidiaries (excluding intercompany Indebtedness between or among Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries) outstanding pursuant to such first paragraph or such clause, together with the aggregate liquidation preference of preferred stock issued by such Restricted Subsidiaries that are non-Guarantor Subsidiaries (excluding intercompany preferred stock issued between or among Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries) outstanding pursuant to such provisions, would exceed the greater of (x) $1.25 billion and (y) 1.25x Adjusted EBITDA as of any date of incurrence. Iron Mountain will not incur, and Iron Mountain will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to incur, any Indebtedness that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of Iron Mountain or such Subsidiary Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the applicable Note Guarantee on substantially identical terms; provided, _however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any_ other Indebtedness of Iron Mountain or a Subsidiary Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis. For purposes of determining compliance with this “—Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock” covenant, for the avoidance of doubt, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of permitted debt described in clauses (1) through (19) above, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, Iron Mountain will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence, or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this covenant. Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement outstanding on the date on which Notes are first issued and authenticated under the Indenture will at all times be deemed to have been incurred on such date in reliance on the exception provided by clause (1) above. The accrual of interest or preferred stock dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, the reclassification of preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles and the payment of dividends on preferred stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant; provided, in each such case, that the amount thereof is included in the Consolidated Interest Expense of Iron Mountain as accrued. For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. Dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. Dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars will be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred; provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred to extend, replace, refund, refinance, renew or defease, or that is exchanged for, other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars, and such extension, replacement, refunding, refinancing, renewal, defeasance or exchange would cause the applicable U.S. Dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such extension, replacement, refunding, refinancing, renewal, defeasance or exchange, such U.S. Dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being extended, replaced, refunded, refinanced, renewed, defeased or exchanged. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values. The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be: (1) the accreted value of the Indebtedness, in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount; (2) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and (3) in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified Person, the lesser of: (i) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and (ii) the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person. ----- In connection with the incurrence of (i) revolving loan Indebtedness under this covenant or (ii) any commitment relating to the incurrence of Indebtedness under this covenant and (in respect of both (i) and (ii)) the granting of any Lien to secure any such Indebtedness, Iron Mountain or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary may designate, such incurrence and the granting of any such Lien as having occurred on the date of first incurrence of such revolving loan Indebtedness or commitment (such date, the “Deemed Date”), and any related subsequent actual incurrence or granting of any such Lien therefor will be deemed for all purposes under the Indenture to have been incurred or granted on such Deemed Date, including, without limitation, for purposes of calculating the Senior Leverage Ratio and usage of any other baskets or ratios under the Indenture (as applicable). The amount of Indebtedness that may be incurred pursuant to any provision of this covenant or secured pursuant to the covenant described below under “—Liens,” (i) shall be deemed to include all amounts necessary to renew, refund, redeem, refinance, replace, restructure, defease or discharge any such Indebtedness incurred and/or secured pursuant to such provisions, including after giving effect to additional Indebtedness in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of fees, premia, underwriting discounts and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with such renewal, refund, redemption, refinancing, replacement, restructuring, defeasance or discharge; and (ii) in any case where such amounts are or may be based on Consolidated Total Assets or Adjusted EBITDA (or any ratio of which Adjusted EBITDA is a component), shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to such incurrence or grant of Lien, due solely to the result of fluctuations in the amount of Consolidated Total Assets or Adjusted EBITDA (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such Indebtedness and such Lien will be permitted to be refinanced or replaced notwithstanding that, after giving effect to such refinancing or replacement, such excess will continue). Liens._ Neither Iron Mountain nor any Restricted Subsidiary may directly or indirectly create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien securing Indebtedness (other than a Permitted Lien) upon any property or assets now owned or hereafter acquired, or any income, profits or proceeds therefrom, or assign or otherwise convey any right to receive income therefrom, unless (a) in the case of any Lien securing any Indebtedness that is contractually subordinated to the Notes or any Note Guarantee, as applicable, the Notes or any such Note Guarantee are secured by a Lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior in priority to such Lien and (b) in the case of any other Lien securing Indebtedness, the Notes or the applicable Note Guarantee are equally and ratably secured with the obligation or liability secured by such Lien. For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (i) a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness need not be permitted solely by reference to one category of Permitted Liens (or any portion thereof) described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant but may be permitted in part under any combination thereof and (ii) in the event that a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of one or more of the categories of Permitted Liens (or any portion thereof) described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, Iron Mountain may, in its sole discretion, classify or reclassify, or later divide, classify or reclassify (as if incurred or issued at such later time), such Lien securing such item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant and at the time of incurrence, issuance, classification or reclassification will be entitled to only include the amount and type of such Lien or such item of Indebtedness secured by such Lien (or any portion thereof) in one of the categories of Permitted Liens (or any portion thereof) described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and, in such event, such Lien securing such item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) will be treated as being incurred, issued or existing pursuant to only such clause or clauses (or any portion thereof) or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant without including such item (or portion thereof) when calculating the amount of Liens or Indebtedness that may be incurred or issued pursuant to any other clause or paragraph (or portion thereof) at such time. With respect to any revolving loan Indebtedness or commitment relating to the incurrence of Indebtedness that is designated to be incurred on any date pursuant to the covenant described under the caption “—Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock,” any Lien that does or that shall secure such Indebtedness may also be designated by Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary to be incurred on such date and, in such event, any related subsequent actual incurrence of such Lien shall be deemed for all purposes under the Indenture to be incurred on such prior date, including for purposes of calculating usage of any “Permitted Lien.” ----- With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such Indebtedness that is not deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under the caption “—Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock.” Dividend and other payment restrictions affecting Restricted Subsidiaries._ Iron Mountain will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to: (1) (i) pay dividends or make any other distributions to Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary (A) on its Capital Stock or (B) with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or (ii) pay any Indebtedness owed to Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary; (2) make loans or advances to Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary; or (3) transfer any of its properties or assets to Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary. However, the preceding restrictions will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of: (1) agreements governing Existing Indebtedness as in effect as of the date of the Indenture, and any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings thereof; provided that such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are no more restrictive in the aggregate with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in the agreements governing Existing Indebtedness as in effect on the date of the Indenture; (2) the Credit Agreement as in effect as of the date of the Indenture, and any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings thereof; provided that such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are no more restrictive in the aggregate with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in the Credit Agreement as in effect on the date of the Indenture; (3) the Indenture and the Notes; (4) applicable law, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any applicable rule, regulation or order; (5) any instrument governing Indebtedness or Capital Stock of a Person acquired by Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary as in effect at the time of such acquisition (except to the extent such Indebtedness was incurred in connection with or in contemplation of such acquisition), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired; provided that, in the case of Indebtedness, such Indebtedness was permitted by the terms of the Indenture to be incurred; (6) customary non-assignment provisions in contracts, licenses or leases entered into in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practices; (7) any agreement for the sale or other disposition of a Restricted Subsidiary that restricts distributions by that Restricted Subsidiary pending its sale or other disposition; (8) restrictions on the transfer of property subject to mortgages, purchase money obligations or Capital Lease Obligations otherwise permitted by clause (5) of the covenant entitled “—Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock;” (9) permitted Refinancing Indebtedness; provided that the restrictions contained in the agreements governing such Refinancing Indebtedness are no more restrictive in the aggregate than those contained in the agreements governing the Indebtedness being refinanced; ----- (10) Liens permitted to be incurred under the provisions of the covenant described above under the caption “—Liens” that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets subject to such Liens; (11) provisions limiting the disposition or distribution of assets or property in joint venture agreements, asset sale agreements, sale-leaseback agreements, stock sale agreements and other similar agreements (including agreements entered into in connection with a Permitted Investment) entered into with the approval of Iron Mountain’s Board of Directors, which limitation is applicable only to the assets that are the subject of such agreements; (12) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business; (13) agreements governing other Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the provisions of the covenant described above under the caption “—Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock” and any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that the restrictions therein will not materially affect Iron Mountain’s ability to make anticipated principal or interest payments on the Notes (as determined in good faith by senior management or the Board of Directors of Iron Mountain); and (14) any Lien or restriction on a Securitization Subsidiary that, in the good faith judgment of senior management or the Board of Directors of Iron Mountain, is reasonably required in connection therewith; provided, however, that such restrictions only apply to Securitization Subsidiaries. Merger, consolidation or sale of assets._ Iron Mountain may not consolidate or merge with or into (whether or not Iron Mountain is the surviving entity), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets in one or more related transactions, to another Person unless: (1) either: (i) Iron Mountain is the surviving entity or (ii) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than Iron Mountain) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition shall have been made is an entity organized or existing under the laws of the U.S., any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (2) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than Iron Mountain), or the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition shall have been made, assumes all the obligations of Iron Mountain under the Notes and the Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture in a form satisfactory to the Trustee); (3) immediately after such transaction no Default or Event of Default exists; and (4) either (a) Iron Mountain or any Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger, or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition shall have been made, will, at the time of such transaction and on a Pro Forma Basis, be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant entitled “—Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock” or (b) at the time of such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition shall have been made on a Pro Forma Basis, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would have been equal to or greater than the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio immediately prior to such transaction. This “—Merger, consolidation or sale of assets” covenant will not apply to any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition of assets between or among Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries. Clauses (3) and (4) of the first paragraph of this covenant will not apply to any consolidation or merger of Iron Mountain (i) with or into a Restricted Subsidiary for any purpose or (ii) with or into an Affiliate solely for the purpose of reincorporating Iron Mountain in another jurisdiction in the U.S. Transactions with affiliates._ Iron Mountain will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into any contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or Guarantee with, or for the ----- benefit of, any Affiliate, each of the foregoing, an Affiliate Transaction, involving aggregate payments or consideration made by Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary in excess of $25.0 million, unless: (a) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to Iron Mountain or such Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by Iron Mountain or such Restricted Subsidiary with a non-Affiliated Person; and (b) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction involving aggregate payments in excess of $200.0 million, Iron Mountain delivers to the Trustee a resolution of Iron Mountain’s Board of Directors set forth in an Officers’ Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with clause (a) above and such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the disinterested members of Iron Mountain’s Board of Directors. The following items shall not be deemed Affiliate Transactions and therefore, will not be subject to the provisions of the prior paragraph: (1) any employment agreement, employee benefit plan, officer or director indemnification agreement or any similar arrangement entered into by Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business and payments thereto; (2) transactions between or among Iron Mountain and one or more Restricted Subsidiaries; (3) transactions with a Person (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary) that is an Affiliate of Iron Mountain solely because Iron Mountain owns, directly or through a Restricted Subsidiary, an Equity Interest in, or controls, such Person; (4) payment of reasonable and customary fees and reimbursements of expenses (pursuant to indemnity arrangements or otherwise) of officers, directors, employees or consultants of Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary; (5) any issuance of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of Iron Mountain to Affiliates of Iron Mountain; (6) Restricted Payments and Permitted Investments that do not violate the provisions of the Indenture described above under the caption “—Restricted payments;” (7) payments to an Affiliate in respect of the Notes or any other Indebtedness of Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary on the same basis as concurrent payments made or offered to be made in respect thereof to non-Affiliates; (8) loans or advances to employees in the ordinary course of business not to exceed $1.0 million in the aggregate at any one time outstanding; (9) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Securitization Facility or any transaction involving the transfer of Receivables of the type specified in the definition of “Credit Facilities” and permitted under paragraph (1) of the covenant entitled “—Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock”; (10) any transfers by Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary to, and any lease entered into by Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary with, a wholly owned Unrestricted Subsidiary in connection with a Sale and Leaseback Transaction permitted under the Indenture; (11) transactions with Joint Ventures and Subsidiaries thereof and Unrestricted Subsidiaries that are approved by a majority of the disinterested members of Iron Mountain’s Board of Directors (or by the audit committee or any committee of the Board of Directors consisting of disinterested members of the Board of Directors) (a director shall be disinterested if he or she has no interest in such Joint Venture or Unrestricted Subsidiary other than through Iron Mountain and its Restricted Subsidiaries); (12) any transaction with respect to which Iron Mountain or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries obtains an opinion as to the fairness to Iron Mountain or such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, of ----- such Affiliate Transaction from a financial point of view issued by an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of national standing; (13) transactions with a Person who is not an Affiliate immediately before the consummation of such transaction that becomes an Affiliate as a result of such transaction; (14) any lease entered into between Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary, as lessee and any Affiliate of Iron Mountain, as lessor, which is approved by the Board of Directors of Iron Mountain in good faith, or any lease entered into between Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary, as lessee, and any Affiliate of Iron Mountain, as lessor, in the ordinary course of business; (15) intellectual property licenses in the ordinary course of business; (16) payments to and from, and transactions with, any Joint Ventures entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice (including, including without limitation, any cash management activities related thereto); (17) the payment of reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses relating to registration rights and indemnities provided to stockholders of Iron Mountain or any parent of Iron Mountain pursuant to a stockholders agreement or a registration rights agreement entered into on or after the Issue Date in connection therewith or similar equity holder’s agreements or limited liability company agreements; and (18) transactions between Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Person, which is an Affiliate solely due to a director or directors of such Person (or a parent company of such Person) also being a director of Iron Mountain; provided, however, that any such director abstains from voting as a director of Iron Mountain on any matter involving such other Person. Additional Note Guarantees._ No Restricted Subsidiary (other than an Excluded Restricted Subsidiary and, following the release or termination of all Guarantees by a Foreign Subsidiary Holdco of any Indebtedness of Iron Mountain or its other Subsidiaries other than the Notes, such Foreign Subsidiary Holdco) may, after the date of the Indenture, Guarantee the payment of (a) any Indebtedness of Iron Mountain or any Subsidiary Guarantor under any Credit Facility or (b) any Indebtedness of Iron Mountain or any Subsidiary Guarantor evidenced by bonds, notes or other debt securities in an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million of more, unless such Restricted Subsidiary shall also execute within 60 days following the date on which such requirement arose a Note Guarantee and deliver an opinion of counsel and Officers’ Certificate to the Trustee with respect thereto, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. No Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate or merge with or into (whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person) another Person (other than Iron Mountain), whether or not affiliated with such Subsidiary Guarantor unless: (1) subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than such Subsidiary Guarantor) assumes all the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Note Guarantee pursuant to a supplemental indenture in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee; and (2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists. The Note Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will automatically be released: (1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Capital Stock of that Subsidiary Guarantor by way of consolidation, merger or otherwise to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) Iron Mountain or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under the caption “—Repurchase at the option of Holders—Asset sales” and such Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the sale or other disposition; (2) in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that Subsidiary Guarantor by way of consolidation, merger or otherwise to a Person that is not (either before ----- or after giving effect to such transaction) Iron Mountain or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described above under “—Repurchase at the option of Holders—Asset sales,” and the Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the sale or other disposition; (3) if Iron Mountain designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; (4) upon legal defeasance or covenant defeasance of the Notes as provided below under the caption “—Legal defeasance and covenant defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and discharge;” (5) upon the release or discharge of the guarantee by, or direct obligation of, such Guarantor of the Indebtedness that resulted in the creation of such Note Guarantee, except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee or direct obligation (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement will constitute a release for the purposes of this provision, and that if any such guarantee is so reinstated, such Note Guarantee shall also be reinstated to the extent that such Guarantor would then be required to provide a Note Guarantee pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant); (6) upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into Iron Mountain or another Guarantor or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor, in each case, in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; or (7) for any Foreign Subsidiary Holdco, concurrently with the release or termination of all Guarantees by such Foreign Subsidiary Holdco of any Indebtedness of Iron Mountain or its other Subsidiaries other than the Notes. Designation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries._ Iron Mountain’s Board of Directors may designate any Subsidiary (including any Restricted Subsidiary or any newly acquired or newly formed Subsidiary) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary so long as: (1) any Investment in such Subsidiary deemed to be made as a result of designating such Subsidiary an Unrestricted Subsidiary will not violate the provisions of the covenant entitled “—Restricted payments;” and (2) neither Iron Mountain nor any Restricted Subsidiary has any obligation to subscribe for additional shares of Capital Stock or other Equity Interests in such Subsidiary, or to maintain or preserve such Subsidiary’s financial condition or to cause such Subsidiary to achieve certain levels of operating results other than as permitted under the covenant entitled “—Restricted payments.” For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this covenant shall not limit or restrict the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any properties or assets to any other Subsidiary, including any Unrestricted Subsidiary, to the extent such sale, transfer or other disposition is permitted by the provisions of the Indenture described above under the covenants entitled “—Repurchase at the option of Holders—Asset sales” or “—Transactions with affiliates.” Iron Mountain’s Board of Directors may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary and such designation will only be permitted if: (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the “—Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock” covenant; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would occur as a result of such designation. Reports._ Whether or not required by the rules and regulations of the SEC, so long as any Notes are outstanding, Iron Mountain will furnish to Holders (or file with the SEC for public availability), within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations: ----- (1) all quarterly and annual financial information that would be required to be contained in a filing with the SEC on Forms 10-Q and 10-K if Iron Mountain were required to file such Forms, including a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and, with respect to the annual information only, a report thereon by Iron Mountain’s certified independent accountants; and (2) all financial information that would be required to be included in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC if Iron Mountain were required to file such reports. In addition, whether or not required by the rules and regulations of the SEC, Iron Mountain will file a copy of all such information and reports with the SEC for public availability (unless the SEC will not accept such a filing) and make such information available to investors who request it in writing. Iron Mountain will not take any action for the purpose of causing the SEC not to accept any such filings. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, the SEC will not accept Iron Mountain’s filings for any reason, Iron Mountain will post the reports referred to in the preceding paragraphs on its website within the time periods that would apply if Iron Mountain were required to file those reports with the SEC. The Trustee shall have no liability or responsibility for the filing, content or timeliness of any such report. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time the Notes are Guaranteed by any direct or indirect parent company of Iron Mountain, Iron Mountain will satisfy its obligations under this covenant with respect to financial information relating to Iron Mountain by furnishing financial information relating to such direct or indirect parent company; provided, however, that the same is accompanied by consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such direct or indirect parent company and any of its Subsidiaries other than Iron Mountain and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the information relating to Iron Mountain, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the other Subsidiaries of Iron Mountain on a standalone basis, on the other hand. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Indenture described under “—Events of default and remedies,” except as provided in the second to last sentence of this paragraph, the sole remedy for any failure to comply by Iron Mountain with this covenant shall be the payment of liquidated damages as described in the following sentence, such failure to comply shall not constitute an Event of Default, and Holders shall not have any right to accelerate the maturity of the Notes as a result of any such failure to comply. If a failure to comply by Iron Mountain with this covenant is continuing on the day that is 60 days following Iron Mountain’s receipt of notice of such failure to comply in accordance with clause (4) of the provisions of the Indenture described under “—Events of default and remedies,”(such notice, the “Reports Default Notice”), Iron Mountain will pay liquidated damages to all Holders at a rate per annum equal to 0.25% of the principal amount of the Notes then outstanding from such date to, but not including, the earlier of (x) the 121st day following Iron Mountain’s receipt of the Reports Default Notice and (y) the date on which the failure to comply by Iron Mountain with this covenant shall have been cured or waived. On the earlier of the dates specified in the immediately preceding clauses (x) and (y), such liquidated damages will cease to accrue. If the failure to comply by Iron Mountain with this covenant shall not have been cured or waived on or before the 121st day following Iron Mountain’s receipt of the Reports Default Notice, then the failure to comply by Iron Mountain with this covenant shall on such 121st day constitute an Event of Default. A failure to comply with this covenant automatically shall cease to be continuing and shall be deemed cured at such time as Iron Mountain furnishes to the Trustee the applicable information or report; provided, however, that the Trustee shall have no obligation whatsoever to determine whether or not such information, documents or reports have been filed pursuant to the EDGAR service (or its successor) nor shall the Trustee have any liability or responsibility for the content of such reports.",N/A,as_expected,2020,87

If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing (subject to the last paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Reports”), the Trustee or Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power with respect to the Notes. The Trustee will be required to give notice to Holders within 90 days after a default of which the Trustee has actual knowledge under the Indenture unless the default has been cured or waived as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal of, premium on, if any, and interest on, the Notes. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under such Indenture at the request or direction of any Holders unless such Holders have offered the Trustee indemnity or security reasonably acceptable to it against any cost, liability or expense incurred in compliance with such request. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if any, when due, no Holder shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to the Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy thereunder, unless: (1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default; (2) Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee under the Indenture; (3) such Holder or Holders offer and, if requested, provide to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request; (4) the Trustee does not comply with such request within 60 days after its receipt of such request and offer of security or indemnity; and (5) during such 60-day period, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such written request. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by written notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders of the Notes, rescind an acceleration or waive any existing Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes and its consequences under the Indenture, if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree, except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, premium on, if any, or interest on, the Notes.

In addition, Iron Mountain may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations released with respect to certain covenants applicable to the Notes, including the one described above under the caption “—Certain covenants—Reports,” that are described in the Indenture, or Covenant Defeasance, and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including non-payment, bankruptcy, receivership and insolvency events) described under “—Events of default and remedies” will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance: (1) Iron Mountain must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of Holders of the Notes, cash in U.S. Dollars for the Notes, non-callable Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the outstanding Notes on the stated maturity or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, of such principal or installment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the outstanding Notes; (2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, Iron Mountain shall have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that (i) Iron Mountain has received from, or there has been published by, the IRS a ruling or (ii) since the date of the Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel shall confirm that, Holders and beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred; (3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, Iron Mountain shall have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel in the U.S. reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that Holders and beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred; (4) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit (and any similar concurrent deposit relating to other Indebtedness), and the granting of Liens to secure such borrowings) on the date of the deposit described in clause (1) above; ----- (5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture and the agreements governing any other Indebtedness being defeased, discharged or replaced) to which Iron Mountain or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which Iron Mountain or any of its Subsidiaries is bound; (6) Iron Mountain shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by Iron Mountain with the intent of preferring Holders of Notes over any other creditors of Iron Mountain with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of Iron Mountain or others; and (7) Iron Mountain shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with. If Iron Mountain accomplished a Legal Defeasance, Holders of the Notes would have to rely solely on the trust deposit for repayment on the Notes. A Holder could not look to Iron Mountain or a Subsidiary Guarantor for repayment in the unlikely event of any shortfall. Conversely, the trust deposit would most likely be protected from any claims of Iron Mountain’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ lenders and other creditors if they ever became bankrupt or insolvent. If Iron Mountain accomplished a Covenant Defeasance, Holders of the Notes can still look to Iron Mountain and the Subsidiary Guarantors for repayment of the Notes if a shortfall in the trust deposit occurred. If one of the remaining Events of Default occurs, for example, a bankruptcy, and the Notes become immediately due and payable, there may be a shortfall.

Except as set forth below, the global Notes may not be transferred except as a whole by DTC to a nominee of DTC or by a nominee of DTC to DTC or another nominee of DTC or by DTC or any such nominee to a successor of DTC or a nominee of such successor. So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner of a global Note, DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole holder of the Notes represented by such global Note for all purposes under the Indenture and the beneficial owners of the Notes will be entitled only to those rights and benefits afforded to them in accordance with DTC’s regular operating procedures. Upon specified written instructions of a participant in DTC, DTC will have its nominee assist participants in the exercise of certain holders’ rights, such as demand for acceleration of maturity or an instruction to the Trustee. Except as provided below, owners of beneficial interests in a global Note will not be entitled to have Notes registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or holders thereof under the Indenture. If (1) DTC is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as depository or if at any time DTC ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and a successor depository is not appointed by Iron Mountain within 90 days, (2) an Event of Default under the Indenture has occurred and is continuing and the beneficial owners representing a majority in principal amount of the Notes advise DTC to cease acting as depository for the Notes or (3) Iron Mountain, in its sole discretion, determines at any time that the Notes shall no longer be represented by a global Note, Iron Mountain will issue individual Notes in certificated form and like tenor and in the applicable principal amount in exchange for the Notes represented by the global Note. In any such instance, an owner of a beneficial interest in a global Note will be entitled to physical delivery of individual Notes in certificated form and like tenor, equal in principal amount to such beneficial interest and to have the Notes in certificated form registered in its name. The Notes so issued in certificated form will be issued in denominations of $2,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof and will be issued in registered form only, without coupons. The Indenture will also provide that, in connection with any proposed transfer involving certificated Notes, the Holder that is the transferor of the Note and Iron Mountain, to the extent that the information is reasonably available to Iron Mountain, shall use commercially reasonably efforts to provide the Trustee with all information as is reasonably requested by the Trustee and necessary to allow the Trustee to comply with any applicable tax reporting obligations, including without limitation any cost basis reporting obligations under Section 6045 of the Code. The Trustee may rely on information provided to it and shall have no responsibility to verify or ensure the accuracy of such information. The following is based on information furnished by DTC: DTC will act as securities depository for the Notes. The Notes will be issued as fully registered Notes registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC, the world’s largest securities depository, is a limited purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. ----- equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues and money market instruments from over 100 countries that DTC’s direct participants deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post trade settlement among direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book entry transfers and pledges between direct participants’accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, or DTCC. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either directly or indirectly. The DTC rules applicable to its participants are on file with the SEC. More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com. Purchases of the Notes under the DTC system must be made by or through direct participants, which will receive a credit for the Notes on DTC’s records. The beneficial interest of each actual purchaser of each Note is in turn to be recorded on the direct and indirect participants’ records. Beneficial owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the direct or indirect participant through which the beneficial owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of beneficial interests in the Notes are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of direct and indirect participants acting on behalf of beneficial owners. Beneficial owners will not receive certificates representing their beneficial interests in Notes, except in the event that use of the book entry system for the Notes is discontinued. The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities which they own. Such limits and such laws may impair the ability of such persons to own, transfer or pledge beneficial interests in a global Note. To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Notes deposited by direct participants with DTC will be registered in the name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co. or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of Notes with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual beneficial owners of the Notes; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the direct participants to whose accounts the Notes will be credited, which may or may not be the beneficial owners. The direct and indirect participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers. Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to direct participants, by direct participants to indirect participants, and by direct participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Beneficial owners of the Notes may wish to take certain steps to augment the transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to the Notes, such as redemption, tenders and defaults. For example, beneficial owners of the Notes may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the Notes for their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to beneficial owners. In the alternative, beneficial owners may wish to provide their names and addresses to the registrar of the Notes and request that copies of the notices be provided to them directly. Any such request may or may not be successful. Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the Notes unless authorized by a direct participant in accordance with DTC’s procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to Iron Mountain as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.’s consenting or voting rights to those direct participants to whose accounts the Notes are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy). Iron Mountain will pay principal of and interest, premium, if any, and the applicable Make-Whole Amount, if any, on the Notes in same day funds to the Trustee and from such Trustee or any paying agent for delivery to DTC, or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit direct participants’ accounts on the applicable payment date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information. Payments by participants to beneficial owners will be governed by standing instructions ----- and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name,” and will be the responsibility of these participants and not of Iron Mountain, the Trustee, DTC or any other party, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements that may be in effect from time to time. Payment of principal, interest, premium, if any, and the applicable Make-Whole Amount, if any, to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC, is the responsibility of Iron Mountain or the Trustee, disbursement of such payments to direct participants is the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the beneficial owners is the responsibility of the direct or indirect participants. Iron Mountain will send any redemption notices to DTC. If less than all of the Notes are being redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each direct participant in such issue to be redeemed. DTC may discontinue providing its services as depository for the Notes at any time by giving Iron Mountain reasonable notice. Under such circumstances, if a successor securities depository is not obtained, Iron Mountain will print and deliver certificated Notes. Iron Mountain may decide to discontinue use of the system of book entry transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depository). In that event, Iron Mountain will print and deliver certificated Notes. Iron Mountain, the initial purchasers and the Trustee will have no responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of the beneficial interests in a global Note, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial interests. The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s system has been obtained from sources that Iron Mountain believes to be reliable, but it takes no responsibility for its accuracy.",N/A,as_expected,2020,87

This discussion is based on current provisions of the Code, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or the Treasury Regulations, rulings, pronouncements, judicial decisions and administrative interpretations of the IRS, all of which are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis, at any time by legislative, judicial or administrative action. If you are considering the purchase of the Notes, you should consult an independent tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income and other tax consequences applicable in your particular circumstances. The following discussion does not purport to be a complete analysis of all the potential U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes. This discussion does not address specific tax consequences that may be relevant to particular investors in light of their individual circumstances (including, for example, entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or partners or members therein, banks or other financial institutions, broker-dealers, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, REITs, tax-exempt entities, common trust funds, foreign governments or international organizations, qualified foreign pension funds, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, certain U.S. expatriates or other foreign persons (except for the discussion of Non-U.S. holders), U.S. persons whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar, persons subject to special accounting rules under Section 451(b) of the Code, dealers in securities or currencies, persons subject to the alternative minimum tax and persons in special situations, such as those who hold Notes as part of a straddle, hedge, synthetic security, conversion transaction or other integrated investment comprising Notes and one or more other investments). This discussion is limited to Notes acquired pursuant to this offering and does not address the tax consequences that may be relevant to a person that acquires the Notes in any other transaction. Further, this discussion does not address the tax consequences to investors that also hold our outstanding indebtedness that will be repaid from the proceeds of this offering. References to the Notes in this discussion pertain to the Initial Notes and not to any Additional Notes. Unless otherwise stated, this discussion is limited to the U.S. federal income tax consequences to beneficial owners of Notes that hold such Notes as capital assets (generally, property held for investment) for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

This position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS were to take a contrary position, a U.S. holder may be required to accrue interest income based on a “comparable yield” (as defined in the Treasury Regulations) determined at the time of issuance of the Notes, with adjustments to such accruals when any contingent payments are made that differ from the payments projected to be made based on the comparable yield.

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation with respect to the assets of such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. In considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a Plan fiduciary should consult with its counsel in order to determine the suitability of the Notes for such Plan, including whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan and the need for, and the availability, if necessary, of any exemptive relief under any such laws or regulations. In addition, a fiduciary of a Plan should consult with its counsel in order to determine if the investment satisfies the fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws. Each ERISA Plan should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the Subsidiary Guarantors, the initial purchasers and the Trustee and their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction Parties”) is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any ERISA Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes.

All communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific purchaser.

Such “prohibited transactions” include, without limitation, (1) a direct or indirect extension of credit to a party in interest or to a disqualified person, (2) the sale or exchange of any property between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, or (3) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or a disqualified person, of any plan assets. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition, holding and/or disposition of Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which any Transaction Party is considered a party in interest or disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules could be applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes by an ERISA Plan, depending on the type and circumstances of the fiduciary making the decision to acquire such Notes and the relationship of the party in interest or disqualified person to the ERISA Plan. Included among these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code for certain transactions between an ERISA Plan and non-fiduciary service providers to the ERISA Plan. In addition, the United States Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These class exemptions (as may be amended from time to time) include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 (respecting transactions effected by independent “qualified professional asset managers”), PTCE 90-1 (respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 91-38 (respecting bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60 (respecting life insurance company general accounts) and PTCE 96-23 (respecting transactions directed by in-house asset managers). Each of these PTCEs contains conditions and limitations on its application. Thus, the fiduciaries of an ERISA Plan that is considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in reliance of any of these, or any other, PTCEs should carefully review the conditions and limitations of the PTCE and consult with their counsel to confirm that it is applicable. There can be no, and we do not provide any, assurance that any PTCE or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the notes. Similar Laws governing the investment and management of the assets of governmental plans, certain church plans and non-U.S. plans which are not subject to ERISA and the Code may contain fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction requirements similar to those under Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. Accordingly, fiduciaries of such Plans, in consultation with their counsel, should consider the impact of Similar Laws on investments in the Notes and the considerations discussed above, to the extent applicable. Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any Plan, unless such acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition (i) are entitled to exemption relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code and are otherwise permissible under all applicable Similar Laws or (ii) will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws. The foregoing discussion is necessarily general in nature, is not intended to be all-inclusive, and should not be construed as legal advice or a legal opinion. Further, no assurance can be given that future legislation, administrative rulings, court decisions or regulatory action will not modify the conclusions set forth in this discussion. Any such changes may be retroactive and thereby apply to transactions entered into prior to the date of their enactment or release. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing the Notes (and holding the Notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such transactions and whether an exemption would be applicable. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,87

Employee benefit plans that are governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) are not subject to the requirements of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code; however, such plans may be subject to non-U.S., federal, state, or local laws or regulations that are substantially similar to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Laws”) or which otherwise affect their ability to invest in the Notes. Any fiduciary of such a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan considering an investment in the Notes (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”) should determine the need for, and, if necessary, the availability of, any exemptive relief under such laws or regulations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,87

The initial purchasers reserve the right to reject any order in whole or in part. The Purchase Agreement provides that Iron Mountain and the Subsidiary Guarantors will indemnify the several initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. In connection with the offering of the Notes, the initial purchasers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the initial purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes or cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the initial purchasers engage in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, they may discontinue them at any time. Certain of the initial purchasers have advised Iron Mountain that they presently intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. The initial purchasers are not obliged, however, to make a market in the Notes and any such market-making may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the initial purchasers. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. Please see “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness—You may find it difficult to sell your Notes because no public trading market for the Notes currently exists and securities laws will restrict your ability to transfer the Notes.” ----- The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the U.S. or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act) except to (i) persons reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional buyers”in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A thereunder and (ii) persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. In addition, until 40 days following the issue date of the Notes, an offer or sale of the Notes initially sold in reliance on Regulation S by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S under the Securities Act. Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations and agreements as described under “Transfer restrictions.” No action has been taken in any jurisdiction by Iron Mountain or any initial purchaser that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to Iron Mountain or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the Notes, the distribution of this offering memorandum and resale of the Notes. Please see “Notice to investors.” The Notes will initially be offered at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After the initial offering of the Notes, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the initial purchasers without notice. The initial purchasers and their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in investment banking and/or commercial banking transactions with, and may perform services for, Iron Mountain and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business, for which they may receive customary fees and expenses. Additionally, some of the initial purchasers (or affiliates thereof) may be holders of the Existing CAD Notes, the Existing Euro Notes and/or the Existing USD 2026 Notes at the time such notes are redeemed and, as such, would receive a portion of the net proceeds of this offering. Iron Mountain has also entered into a distribution agreement with certain of the initial purchasers and certain other investment banks, as sales agents, pursuant to which it may issue and sell shares of its common stock from time to time. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the initial purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. If any of the initial purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, certain of those initial purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, certain of those initial purchasers or their affiliates are likely to hedge and certain other of those initial purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, these initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the closing date specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which is the business day following the date of this offering memorandum (such settlement cycle being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish ----- to trade the Notes before the second business day prior to the closing date specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers who wish to trade the Notes prior to their date of delivery hereunder should consult their own advisors.",N/A,as_expected,2020,87
