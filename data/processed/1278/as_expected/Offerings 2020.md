information incorporated herein by reference, and, if given or made, any other information or representation

information contained in this offering memorandum, including information incorporated herein by reference,
is as of the date hereof and subject to change, completion or amendment without notice. Neither the
delivery of this offering memorandum at any time nor any subsequent commitment to enter into any

or in our affairs since the date hereof.

Iron Mountain reserves the right to withdraw this offering at any time. This offering is subject to the
terms described in this offering memorandum and the indenture relating to the Notes.

This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell the Notes to or a solicitation of an offer
to buy the Notes from any person in any jurisdiction where it is unlawful to make such an offer or solicitation.

The distribution of this offering memorandum and the offer and sale of the Notes may be restricted by
law in certain jurisdictions. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum or any of the Notes
come must inform themselves about and observe any such restrictions. You must comply with all applicable
laws and regulations (including obtaining required consents, approvals and permissions) in any jurisdiction
in which you possess or distribute this offering memorandum or in which you purchase, offer or sell the Notes.
Iron Mountain does not have any responsibility therefor. See “Transfer restrictions.”

The Notes will be available in book-entry form only. The Notes sold pursuant to this offering
memorandum will be issued in the form of one or more global certificates, which will be deposited with, or
on behalf of, DTC, as depositary, and registered in the name of Cede & Co., the nominee of DTC. Beneficial
interests in the global certificates will be shown on, and transfers of the global certificates will be effected
only through, records maintained by DTC. After the initial issuance of the global certificates, Notes in
certificated form will be issued in exchange for the global certificates only as set forth in the indenture relating
to the Notes.

Each prospective purchaser of the Notes must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in force
in any jurisdiction in which it purchases, offers or sells the Notes and must obtain any consent, approval or
permission required by it for the purchase, offer or sale by it of the Notes under the laws and regulations in

date specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which is the business day following
the date of this offering memorandum (such settlement cycle being referred to as “T+ ”). Under
Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two
business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish
to trade the Notes before the second business day prior to the closing date specified on the cover page of
this offering memorandum will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+,
to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement.
Purchasers who wish to trade the Notes prior to their date of delivery hereunder should consult their own
advisors.

or could, in the future, be converted into U.S. Dollars, CAD or euro, as the case may be, at any particular
rate, if at all.

We have made statements in this offering memorandum and the documents incorporated by reference
herein that constitute “forward-looking statements” as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995 and other securities laws. These forward-looking statements concern our operations,
economic performance, financial condition, goals, beliefs, future growth strategies, investment objectives,
plans and current expectations, such as our (1) commitment to future dividend payments, (2) expected change
in volume of records stored with us, (3) expectations that profits will increase in our growth portfolio,
including our higher-growth markets, and that our growth portfolio will become a larger part of our business
over time, (4) expectations related to our revenue management programs and continuous improvement
initiatives, (5) expectations related to our leverage ratio and capital requirements, (6) expected ability to
identify and complete acquisitions and drive returns on invested capital, (7) anticipated capital expenditures,

of, Project Summit, our global program designed to better position us for future growth and achievement
of our strategic objectives, announced in October 2019. These forward-looking statements are subject to
various known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. When we use words such as “believe,”
“expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate” or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements.
Although we believe that our forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, our expected
results may not be achieved, and actual results may differ materially from our expectations.

In addition, important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include,
among others:

including its effects on us, the markets we serve and our customers and the third parties with whom
we do business within those markets;

   - our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, or REIT;

capital and invest according to plan;

   - our ability to execute on Project Summit and the potential impacts of Project Summit on our ability
to retain and recruit employees and execute on our strategy;

   - the cost and our ability to comply with laws, regulations and customer demands relating to data
security and privacy issues, as well as fire and safety standards;

   - the impact of litigation or disputes that may arise in connection with incidents in which we fail to
protect our customers’ information or our internal records or information technology, or IT, systems
and the impact of such incidents on our reputation and ability to compete;

   - changes in the price for our storage and information management services relative to the cost of
providing such storage and information management services;

   - changes in the political and economic environments in the countries in which our international
subsidiaries operate and changes in the global political climate;

   - the impact of executing on our growth strategy through joint ventures;

   - our ability to comply with our existing debt obligations and restrictions in our debt instruments or
to obtain additional financing to meet our working capital needs;


-----

   - the impact of service interruptions or equipment damage and the cost of power on our data center
operations;

   - changes in the cost of our debt;

   - the impact of alternative, more attractive investments on dividends;

   - the cost or potential liabilities associated with real estate necessary for our business;

  - the performance of business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management
expertise; and

   - other trends in competitive or economic conditions affecting our financial condition or results of
operations not presently contemplated.

Other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our
forward-looking statements are described more fully in the Annual Report and in the Quarter Reports (each
as defined herein), including those described under the caption “Risk Factors,” and in Iron Mountain’s
other reports filed from time to time with the SEC.

These cautionary statements should not be construed by you to be exhaustive, and they are made only
as of the date of this offering memorandum. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements except
as statements of our present intentions and of our present expectations, which may or may not occur. You
should read these cautionary statements as being applicable to all forward-looking statements wherever
they appear. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to release publicly the result of any
revision to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the
date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events or otherwise. Readers are also urged to

Iron Mountain’s consolidated revenues for the six month period
ended June 30, 2020. Iron Mountain’s non-guarantor subsidiaries
held 40.0% of Iron Mountain’s consolidated total assets as of June 30,
2020, without reduction for the non-controlling interests in certain
of its international subsidiaries.

**Offer to repurchase the Notes . . .** Upon the sale of certain assets or upon a Change of Control, Iron
Mountain or a Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, may be required
to offer to repurchase the Notes under the terms set forth under
“Description of the notes—Repurchase at the option of Holders.”

**Optional redemption . . . . . . . . .** Prior to, 2026, Iron Mountain may, at its option,
redeem all or a portion of the Notes at the make-whole price
described under “Description of the notes—Optional redemption.”

Prior to, 2023, Iron Mountain may, at its option,
redeem up to 40% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes with
an amount not greater than the net proceeds of certain equity
offerings at the redemption price set forth under “Description of
the notes—Optional redemption” so long as at least 50% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes (originally issued) remains
outstanding immediately afterwards (unless all Notes are redeemed
substantially concurrently).

Iron Mountain has the option to redeem all or a portion of the
Notes at any time on or after, 2026 at the redemption prices
set forth under “Description of the notes—Optional redemption.”

**Certain covenants . . . . . . . . . . .** Iron Mountain will issue the Notes under an indenture with Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The indenture will
contain various covenants that will, among other things, restrict the
ability of Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries to:

                        - borrow money;

                        - pay dividends on stock or repurchase stock;

                        - make investments;

                        - use assets as security in other transactions;

                        - enter into transactions with affiliates; and


-----

                        - sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies.

These covenants are subject to important limitations and exceptions.
See “Description of the notes—Certain covenants.” These
covenants will cease to apply to the Notes if the Notes receive
investment grade ratings from any two of Moody’s Investors Service,
Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group and Fitch Ratings Inc.,
and no default or event of default with respect to the Notes has
occurred and is continuing under the indenture. See “Description of
the notes—Certain covenants.”

**Absence of public market for the**
**Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Notes will be a new issue of securities and there is currently no
established trading market for the Notes. Iron Mountain does not
intend to apply for a listing of the Notes on any securities exchange
or an automated dealer quotation system. Accordingly, we cannot
assure you as to the development or liquidity of any market for the
Notes. Certain of the initial purchasers for the Notes have advised
Iron Mountain that they currently intend to make a market in the
Notes. However, they are not obligated to do so, and any market
making with respect to the Notes may be discontinued at any time
without notice.

**Trustee . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Wells Fargo Bank, National Association.

**Use of proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . .** Iron Mountain intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to
redeem all its outstanding C$250.0 million (or $183.3 million as
of June 30, 2020) aggregate principal amount of 5[3]∕8% CAD Senior
Notes due 2023, or the Existing CAD Notes, €300.0 million (or
$336.9 million as of June 30, 2020) aggregate principal amount of
3% Euro Senior Notes due 2025, or the Existing Euro Notes, and
$250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5[3]∕8% Senior Notes due
2026, or the Existing USD 2026 Notes, to pay the related
redemption premia, and the balance, if any, for general corporate
purposes. For more details, see the section captioned “Use of
proceeds.”

**Risk factors . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** See “Risk factors” for a discussion of the risk factors you should
carefully consider before deciding to invest in the Notes.


-----

**RISK FACTORS**

_You should carefully consider the following factors and the factors included under the caption “Risk_
_Factors” in the Annual Report and the Quarter Reports, which are incorporated herein by reference and include,_
_in the case of the First Quarter Report, certain risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and other information_
_contained or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum before deciding to invest in the Notes._

**Risks related to our indebtedness**

**_Our substantial indebtedness, including that of Iron Mountain’s consolidated subsidiaries, could adversely_**
**_affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under various debt instruments._**

We, including Iron Mountain’s consolidated subsidiaries, have, and after this offering will continue to
have, a significant amount of indebtedness. Assuming that (i) this offering and the application of the net
proceeds from this offering as described under “Use of proceeds” and (ii) the application of a portion of the
net proceeds from the June 2020 Offering to redeem in full the Senior Subordinated Notes, in each case
had been completed on June 30, 2020, total long-term debt would have been $9.1 billion (excluding
$1,384.7 million of available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility), stockholders’ equity would
have been $972.6 million and cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash) would have been
$183.1 million. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to current and potential
investors. These risks include:

   - inability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our various debt instruments;

   - inability to make borrowings to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and strategic
opportunities, including acquisitions, further organic development of our global data center business
and expansions into adjacent businesses, and other general corporate requirements, including
possible required repurchases, redemptions or prepayments of our various indebtedness;

   - limits on our distributions to stockholders; in this regard if these limits prevented us from satisfying
our REIT distribution requirements, we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT or, if
these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT but do nevertheless prevent
us from distributing 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income
tax, and potentially a nondeductible excise tax, on the retained amounts;

   - limits on future borrowings under our existing or future credit arrangements, which could affect our
ability to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs;

   - inability to generate sufficient funds to cover required interest payments;

   - restrictions on our ability to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms;

   - limits on our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the information
management services industry; and

   - inability to adjust to adverse economic conditions that could place us at a disadvantage to our
competitors with less debt and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that
our indebtedness prevents us from pursuing.

We are subject to risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow could be
insufficient to meet required payments on our debt. The Credit Agreement and the indentures relating to
Iron Mountain’s outstanding unsecured senior notes and the unsecured senior notes, or the IMUK Notes,
of Iron Mountain (UK) PLC, or IMUK, or collectively the Existing Indentures, contain customary restrictive
covenants and financial restrictions on us, including a maximum allowable net total lease adjusted leverage
ratio of 6.5x (subject to certain exceptions) under the Credit Agreement, and (prior to giving effect to this
offering and the use of net proceeds therefrom) a maximum allowable leverage ratio of 6.5x or 7.0x or a
minimum allowable fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.0x for the incurrence of indebtedness (subject to certain
exceptions) under the Existing Indentures. Assuming that (i) this offering and the application of the net
proceeds from this offering as described under “Use of proceeds” and (ii) the application of a portion of the
net proceeds from the June 2020 Offering to redeem in full the Senior Subordinated Notes, in each case
had been completed on June 30, 2020, the leverage ratio under the applicable Existing Indentures would have


-----

been 6.0x, the fixed charge coverage ratio under the applicable Existing Indentures would have been 3.1x
and none of the Existing Indentures with a 6.5x leverage ratio requirement will remain outstanding.

**_Restrictive debt covenants may limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy._**

The Credit Agreement and the Existing Indentures contain, and the indenture for the Notes will
contain, covenants restricting or limiting our ability or that of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other
things:

   - incur additional indebtedness;

   - pay dividends or make other restricted payments;

   - make asset dispositions;

   - create or permit liens;

   - sell, transfer or exchange assets;

   - guarantee certain indebtedness;

   - make acquisitions and other investments; and

   - enter into partnerships and joint ventures.

These restrictions may adversely affect our ability to pursue acquisitions and other growth strategies.

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of outstanding senior notes,_**
**_including the Notes, upon a change of control event as required by the Existing Indentures or as will be required_**
**_by the indenture for the Notes._**

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined under “Description of the notes”), we will be
required to offer to repurchase all outstanding senior notes, including the Notes offered hereby. However, it
is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the Change of Control to make the required
repurchase of such senior notes, including the Notes, or that restrictions in the Credit Agreement will not
allow such repurchases. Certain important corporate events, however, such as leveraged recapitalizations
that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a Change of Control under the
indenture relating to the Notes or the Existing Indentures. See “Description of the notes—Repurchase at the
option of Holders—Change of control.” In addition, from and after the date the Notes receive investment
grade ratings from any two rating agencies, as more fully described under “Description of the notes—
Certain covenants—Changes in covenants when the Notes are rated investment grade,” a Change of
Control will be deemed to occur with respect to the Notes only if accompanied by a Rating Decline (as
defined under “Description of the notes”).

**_Iron Mountain is a holding company, and, therefore, its ability to make payments on its various debt obligations,_**
**_including the Notes, depends in part on the operations of its subsidiaries._**

Iron Mountain is a holding company; substantially all of its assets consist of the equity in its subsidiaries,
and substantially all of its operations are conducted by its direct and indirect consolidated subsidiaries. As a
result, its ability to make payments on its debt obligations, including payments on the Notes, will be
dependent upon the receipt of sufficient funds from its subsidiaries, whose ability to distribute funds may be
limited by local capital requirements, joint venture structures and other applicable restrictions. However,
the Notes are guaranteed, on a joint and several and full and unconditional basis, by Iron Mountain’s U.S.
subsidiaries that represent the substantial majority of its U.S. operations.

**_Despite our current indebtedness levels, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt._**

The terms of the indenture relating to the Notes generally will not, and the Existing Indentures
generally do not, cap the maximum amount of additional funds that may be borrowed under the Credit
Agreement and possible future credit arrangements. The maximum amount available for borrowing under
the Credit Agreement is $2.7 billion, which can be increased to $3.26 billion, in the form of term loans or


-----

through increased commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to the conditions specified in
the Credit Agreement.

**_Our ability to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including that of Iron Mountain’s consolidated_**
**_subsidiaries, depends on many factors beyond our control._**

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including that of Iron Mountain’s
consolidated subsidiaries, and to fund capital expenditures and future acquisitions will depend on our ability
to generate cash in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive,
legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We believe our cash flow from continuing
operations and available borrowings under existing and future credit arrangements will be adequate to
meet our foreseeable future liquidity needs.

We cannot assure you, however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from continuing
operations or that future borrowings will be available under existing and future credit arrangements in an
amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness and that of Iron Mountain’s consolidated subsidiaries
or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness and
that of our consolidated subsidiaries, including the Credit Agreement and the Notes, on or before maturity.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or that of our consolidated
subsidiaries, including the Credit Agreement and the Notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

**_The Notes and the guarantees will be general unsecured senior obligations; the Notes and the guarantees will be_**
**_effectively subordinated to all of Iron Mountain’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ existing and future secured_**
**_debt, including obligations under the Credit Agreement, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the_**
**_debt._**

If Iron Mountain or any Subsidiary Guarantor is declared bankrupt, becomes insolvent or is liquidated
or reorganized, any secured debt of Iron Mountain or that Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be,
including under the Credit Agreement, will be entitled to be paid in full from Iron Mountain’s or such
Subsidiary Guarantor’s assets, as applicable, securing that debt before any payment may be made with respect
to the Notes or the affected guarantees. Holders of the Notes will participate ratably in any remaining
assets with all holders of Iron Mountain’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ unsecured indebtedness that does
not rank junior to the Notes, including all of Iron Mountain’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ other
general creditors, based upon the respective amounts owed to each holder or creditor. In any of the foregoing
events, there may not be sufficient assets to pay the secured indebtedness and the amounts due on the
Notes. As a result, holders of the Notes would likely receive less, ratably, than holders of secured indebtedness.
It is possible that there will be no assets from which claims of holders of the Notes can be satisfied (except
as prohibited by law and certain permitted exceptions). As of June 30, 2020, Iron Mountain and the Subsidiary
Guarantors had $1,499.8 million in secured indebtedness outstanding, including $362.1 million outstanding
under the Revolving Credit Facility, $221.9 million outstanding under the Term Loan A Facility and
$683.0 million outstanding under the Term Loan B Facility. Assuming that (i) this offering and the
application of the net proceeds from this offering as described under “Use of proceeds” and (ii) the
application of a portion of the net proceeds from the June 2020 Offering to redeem in full the Senior
Subordinated Notes, in each case had been completed on June 30, 2020, Iron Mountain and the Subsidiary
Guarantors would have had $1,499.8 million in secured indebtedness outstanding, and there would have
been $1,384.7 million in available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.

**_The Notes and the guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of Iron Mountain’s existing and_**
**_future non-guarantor subsidiaries. Accordingly, your right to receive payments on the Notes could be adversely_**
**_affected if any of the non-guarantor subsidiaries declares bankruptcy, liquidates or reorganizes._**

The Subsidiary Guarantors will guarantee the Notes. Iron Mountain’s other subsidiaries will not
guarantee the Notes, including its existing non-U.S. subsidiaries and, we anticipate, future non-U.S.
subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of the non-guarantor
subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of
their claims from the assets of those non-guarantor subsidiaries before any assets are made available for
distribution to us. Assuming that (i) this offering and the application of the net proceeds from this offering


-----

as described under “Use of proceeds” and (ii) the application of a portion of the net proceeds from the
June 2020 Offering to redeem in full the Senior Subordinated Notes, in each case had been completed on
June 30, 2020, the Notes and the guarantees would have been structurally subordinated to $2,058.8 million
of indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of the non-guarantor subsidiaries, including
$229.7 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility that has been borrowed by Iron Mountain’s
non-guarantor subsidiaries. Iron Mountain’s non-guarantor subsidiaries generated 37.6% of Iron Mountain’s
consolidated revenues for the six month period ended June 30, 2020. Iron Mountain’s non-guarantor
subsidiaries held 40.0% of its consolidated total assets as of June 30, 2020, without reduction for the
non-controlling interests in certain of its international subsidiaries.

The condensed consolidating financial information included in the notes to Iron Mountain’s condensed
consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum from
the Annual Report and the Second Quarter Report, includes historical information for Iron Mountain, the
Subsidiary Guarantors and the non-guarantor subsidiaries on a combined basis.

**_Federal and state statutes could allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void guarantees and require_**
**_holders of the Notes to return payments received from guarantors._**

Under federal bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, administration, receivership, liquidation or
winding up laws, including but not limited to the provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code, and
comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws or other applicable domestic or foreign laws, a
guarantee could be voided, or claims in respect of a guarantee could be subordinated to all other debts of that
guarantor, if, among other things, the entering into of a guarantee was found to be a fraudulent transfer, a
transfer at undervalue, a fraudulent conveyance or a voidable preference at the time the guarantor incurred
the indebtedness evidenced by its guarantee. Such a finding might occur if the guarantor, among other
things:

   - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the incurrence of such
guarantee;

   - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;

   - incurred the guarantee with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another, hinder,
delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the relevant guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, when
the granting of a guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient
was aware that the relevant guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant guarantee;

   - was engaged in a business or transaction for which the guarantor’s remaining assets constituted
unreasonably small capital; or

   - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they
fall due.

In addition, any payment by that guarantor pursuant to its guarantee could be voided and required to
be returned to the guarantor, or to a fund for the benefit of the creditors of the guarantor.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of these laws will vary depending upon the law applied in any
proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer, a transfer at undervalue, a conveyance or a voidable
preference has occurred and case law interpreting these tests is not uniform. Generally, however, a
guarantor would be considered insolvent if:

   - the sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the fair
saleable value of all of its assets;

   - if the present fair saleable value of its assets were less than the amount that would be required to pay
its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, as they
become due;

   - it could not pay or has not paid its debts or obligations as they generally become due; or

   - it has ceased paying its current obligations in the ordinary course of business as they generally
become due.


-----

To the extent a court voids any Subsidiary Guarantor’s guarantee of the Notes as a fraudulent transfer,
preference or conveyance or holds it unenforceable for any other reason, holders of the Notes would cease
to have a direct claim against the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor. In the event that any guarantee is declared
invalid or unenforceable as to any Subsidiary Guarantor, in whole or in part, the Notes would be, to the
extent of such invalidity or unenforceability, effectively subordinated to all liabilities of such Subsidiary
Guarantor.

The Subsidiary Guarantors’ guarantee of the Notes will contain a provision intended to limit each
Subsidiary Guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence
of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance. However, there can be no assurance as
to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Subsidiary
Guarantor. Moreover, this provision may not be effective to protect a Subsidiary Guarantor’s guarantee
from being voided under fraudulent conveyance laws. There is a possibility that the entire amount of each
Subsidiary Guarantor’s guarantee of the Notes may be set aside, in which case the entire amount of such
liabilities may be extinguished.

**_Some or all of the guarantees of the Notes may be released automatically._**

A Subsidiary Guarantor may be released from its guarantee at any time upon a sale, exchange or
transfer, in compliance with the provisions of the indenture relating to the Notes, of the capital stock of
such Subsidiary Guarantor or of substantially all of the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor. In addition,
in some other circumstances, a Subsidiary Guarantor may be released from its guarantee in connection with
our designation of such Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or Excluded Restricted
Subsidiary (each as defined herein). A Subsidiary Guarantor, if a Foreign Subsidiary Holdco (as defined
herein), may also be released from its guarantee upon the concurrent release or termination of all guarantees
of other indebtedness by such Subsidiary Guarantor. See “Description of the notes—Certain covenants—
Additional Note Guarantees.”

**_You may find it difficult to sell your Notes because no public trading market for the Notes currently exists and_**
**_securities laws will restrict your ability to transfer the Notes._**

The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act. Accordingly, the Notes may not be
offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from or in a transaction not subject to the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.

The Notes will constitute a new issue of securities and there is currently no established trading market
for the Notes. Iron Mountain does not intend to apply for a listing of the Notes on any securities exchange
or an automated dealer quotation system. Accordingly, we cannot assure you as to the development or liquidity
of any market for the Notes. Certain of the initial purchasers for the Notes have advised us that they
currently intend to make a market in the Notes. However, they are not obligated to do so, and any market
making with respect to the Notes may be discontinued at any time without notice. If no active trading market
develops, you may not be able to resell your Notes at their fair market value or at all. Future trading prices
of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our
operating results and the market for similar securities. Even if a market does develop, the liquidity of the
trading market in the Notes, and the market price quoted for the Notes, may be adversely affected by changes
in the overall market for high yield securities and by changes in our financial performance or prospects or
in the prospects for companies in our industry generally.

Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused
substantial volatility in prices. The market for the Notes, if any, may be subject to similar disruptions. A
disruption may have a negative effect on you as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects or
performance.

**_If the Notes are rated investment grade on any date following the date of the indenture by two rating agencies,_**
**_certain covenants contained in the indenture will no longer be applicable to the Notes, and the holders of the Notes_**
**_will lose the protection of these covenants._**

The indenture will contain certain covenants that will no longer be applicable to the Notes if, on any
date following the date of the indenture, the Notes are rated investment grade by any two of Moody’s


-----

Investors Service, Inc., Standard & Poor’s Rating Group and Fitch Ratings Inc., and no default or event of
default has occurred and is continuing under the indenture. See “Description of the notes—Certain
covenants.” These covenants will restrict, among other things, Iron Mountain’s and certain of its subsidiaries’
ability to pay dividends, incur additional debt and enter into certain types of transactions. Because Iron
Mountain and certain of its subsidiaries would not be subject to these restrictions if the Notes are rated
investment grade by the rating agencies, Iron Mountain and certain of its subsidiaries would be able to make
dividends and distributions, incur substantial additional debt and enter into certain types of transactions.

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

Because the Notes and the guarantees have not and will not have been, and are not required to be,
registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be offered
or sold in the U.S. except to persons reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional buyers” in accordance
with Rule 144A, in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to another exemption
from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and all other
applicable laws. These restrictions may limit the ability of investors to resell the Notes and purchasers of
the Notes may be required to bear the risk of the investment for an indefinite period of time. It is the
obligation of purchasers of the Notes to ensure that all offers and sales of the Notes in the U.S. and other
countries comply with applicable securities laws. For further information, see “Transfer restrictions.”


-----

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The net proceeds from this offering are estimated to be approximately $839.6 million, after deducting
discounts to the initial purchasers and estimated offering expenses. Iron Mountain intends to use the net
proceeds from this offering to redeem all C$250.0 million (or $183.3 million as of June 30, 2020) aggregate
principal amount of the Existing CAD Notes, €300.0 million (or $336.9 million as of June 30, 2020) aggregate
principal amount of the Existing Euro Notes, and $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of the
Existing USD 2026 Notes, to pay the related redemption premia, and the balance, if any, for general corporate
purposes.

Over the last 12 months, Iron Mountain and its subsidiaries used borrowings under the Revolving
Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on June 3, 2023, at
which point all obligations become due. The average interest rate in effect on indebtedness outstanding under
the Revolving Credit Facility as of June 30, 2020 was 1.9%. Amounts repaid under the Revolving Credit
Facility may be reborrowed.

Each initial purchaser (or an affiliate thereof) is a lender under the Revolving Credit Facility and, as
such, will receive a portion of the net proceeds of this offering. Additionally, some of the initial purchasers
(or affiliates thereof) may be holders of the Existing Euro Notes, the Existing USD 2026 Notes and/or the
Existing CAD Notes at the time such notes are redeemed and, as such, would receive a portion of the net
proceeds of this offering. See “Plan of distribution.”

column in the table above reflects (a) a reduction of $764.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, (b) the redemption
in full of the outstanding principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes and (c) an increase in outstanding
borrowings of $245.0 million under the Accounts Receivable Securitzation Program, in each case in connection with
the redemption of the Senior Subordinated Notes. As adjusted cash and cash equivalents also includes a portion
of the net proceeds from this offering that is intended to be used for general corporate purposes.

(2) Amounts set forth in the table are not reduced by deferred financing costs associated with the incurrence of such
indebtedness.

instruments, together with all intercompany obligations (including promissory notes) of subsidiaries owed to Iron
Mountain or to the Subsidiary Guarantors. In addition, Iron Mountain Canada has pledged 66% of the capital
stock of its subsidiaries, and all intercompany obligations (including promissory notes) owed to or held by it, to
secure the Canadian dollar subfacility under the Revolving Credit Facility. The maximum amount available for
borrowing under the Credit Agreement is $2.7 billion, which can be increased to $3.26 billion, in the form of term
loans or through increased commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to the conditions specified
in the Credit Agreement.
(4) As of June 30, 2020, there was $1,384.7 million in available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of
August 6, 2020, there was $530.4 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.

(5) The amount of debt for the Term Loan B reflects an unamortized original issue discount of approximately
$1.2 million as of June 30, 2020.

(6) Iron Mountain Australia Group Pty, Ltd., or Iron Mountain Australia, is the borrower under this term loan
facility, or the AUD Term Loan, which is secured by substantially all assets of Iron Mountain Australia and is

an unamortized original issue discount of approximately $1.0 million as of June 30, 2020.

(7) IMUK and Iron Mountain (UK) Data Centre Limited are the borrowers under this revolving credit facility, or the
UK Bilateral Facility, which is secured by certain properties in the United Kingdom and is guaranteed by Iron
Mountain and the Subsidiary Guarantors. The maximum amount permitted to be borrowed under the UK Bilateral
Facility is £140.0 million, and IMUK has the option to request additional commitments of up to £125.0 million,
subject to the conditions specified in the UK Bilateral Facility.

(8) Iron Mountain Canada Operations ULC, or IM Canada, is the direct obligor on these Existing CAD Notes,
which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior basis, by Iron Mountain and the Subsidiary Guarantors.

following the closing date of this offering at a redemption price equal to 104.031% of the principal amount thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. The amount set forth in the table above
is based on the exchange rate used in connection with our Second Quarter Report. The Bloomberg rate as of
August 5, 2020 was $1 = C$1.3266. The actual amount used for the redemption of the Existing CAD Notes will vary
due to, among other things, the applicable exchange rate on the date of redemption.

(9) Iron Mountain is the direct obligor on these Existing EUR Notes, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed,
on a senior basis, by the Subsidiary Guarantors. We expect all €300.0 million outstanding principal amount of

Quarter Report. The Bloomberg rate as of August 5, 2020 was $1 = €0.8429. The actual amount used for the
redemption of the Existing EUR Notes will vary due to, among other things, the applicable exchange rate on the date
of redemption.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

This summary is subject to and is qualified by reference to all the provisions of the Notes and the
Indenture. You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under the subheading
“—Certain definitions.” Certain defined terms used in this description but not defined below under the
subheading “—Certain definitions” have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture described below.
In this description, all references to “Iron Mountain,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer only to Iron Mountain
Incorporated and not to any of its subsidiaries (unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires).

**General**

Iron Mountain will issue % Senior Notes due 2031 denominated in U.S. Dollars, or the Notes,
under an indenture dated as of the Issue Date, or the Indenture, among Iron Mountain, the Subsidiary
Guarantors, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, or the Trustee. The Indenture, the Notes
and the Note Guarantees will be governed by the laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements
made and to be performed in such state.

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture. It does not restate
the Indenture in its entirety. You are urged to read the Indenture because it, and not this description, defines
your rights as a holder of the Notes. See “Where you can find more information; information incorporated
by reference” in this offering memorandum for information about how to locate this document.

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Note Guarantees**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will be:

   - general unsecured obligations of Iron Mountain, that are unconditionally guaranteed by the
Subsidiary Guarantors;

   - pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of Iron Mountain;

   - senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated Indebtedness of Iron Mountain;

   - effectively subordinated to Iron Mountain’s secured Indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the
collateral securing such Indebtedness; and

   - structurally subordinated to all liabilities of Iron Mountain’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the
Notes.

**_The Note Guarantees_**

The Notes will be guaranteed:

   - on the Issue Date, by Iron Mountain’s U.S. Subsidiaries that represent the substantial majority of its
U.S. operations; and

   - thereafter, by each of Iron Mountain’s newly acquired or created Restricted Subsidiaries (other than
any Excluded Restricted Subsidiary) to the extent required under the covenant described below
under “—Certain covenants—Additional Note Guarantees.”

Each Note Guarantee will be:

   - a general unsecured obligation of the Subsidiary Guarantor;

   - pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Subsidiary
Guarantor;

   - senior in right of payment to any existing and future subordinated Indebtedness of the Subsidiary
Guarantor;

   - effectively subordinated to the secured Indebtedness of the Subsidiary Guarantor, to the extent of
the value of the collateral securing such Indebtedness; and


-----

   - structurally subordinated to all liabilities of subsidiaries of the Subsidiary Guarantor that do not
guarantee the Notes.

**Ranking**

The Notes and the Note Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to all borrowings under the Credit
Agreement to the extent of the value of the collateral securing those borrowings, which currently includes
the Capital Stock and other equity interests of most of Iron Mountain’s U.S. Subsidiaries and up to 66% of
the Capital Stock and other equity interests of most of Iron Mountain’s first-tier non-U.S. Subsidiaries,
together with all intercompany obligations of Subsidiaries owed to Iron Mountain or the Subsidiary
Guarantors and all intercompany promissory notes held by Iron Mountain or the Subsidiary Guarantors.
Assuming that (i) this offering and the application of the net proceeds from this offering as described under
“Use of proceeds” and (ii) the application of a portion of the net proceeds from the June 2020 Offering to
redeem in full the Senior Subordinated Notes, in each case had been completed on June 30, 2020, the Notes
and the Note Guarantees would have been effectively subordinated to $1,499.8 million of Iron Mountain’s
and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ secured indebtedness and there would have been $1,384.7 million in available
borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness—
The Notes and the guarantees will be general unsecured senior obligations; the Notes and the guarantees will
be effectively subordinated to all of Iron Mountain’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ existing and future
secured debt, including obligations under the Credit Agreement, to the extent of the value of the collateral
securing the debt.”

Not all of Iron Mountain’s Subsidiaries will Guarantee the Notes. Iron Mountain expects that its
direct and indirect wholly owned U.S. Subsidiaries that represent the substantial majority of its U.S.
operations will Guarantee the Notes. None of Iron Mountain’s other existing or future non-U.S. Subsidiaries
will Guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of Iron
Mountain’s non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally
be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those non-Guarantor Subsidiaries before any
assets are made available for distribution to Iron Mountain and the Subsidiary Guarantors. Assuming that
(i) this offering and the application of the net proceeds from this offering as described under “Use of proceeds”
and (ii) the application of a portion of the net proceeds from the June 2020 Offering to redeem in full the
Senior Subordinated Notes, in each case had been completed on June 30, 2020, the Notes and the Note
Guarantees would have been structurally subordinated to $2,058.8 million of indebtedness and other liabilities
(including trade payables) of the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, including $229.7 million outstanding under
the Revolving Credit Facility that has been borrowed by Iron Mountain’s non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. Iron
Mountain’s non-Guarantor Subsidiaries generated 38.2% of Iron Mountain’s consolidated revenues for
the year ended December 31, 2019 and 37.6% of Iron Mountain’s consolidated revenues for the six month
period ended June 30, 2020. Iron Mountain’s non-Guarantor Subsidiaries held 40.0% of our Consolidated
Total Assets as of June 30, 2020, without reduction for the non-controlling interests in certain of our
international Subsidiaries.

As of the date of the Indenture, all of Iron Mountain’s U.S. Subsidiaries (other than Iron Mountain
Mortgage Finance Holdings, LLC, Iron Mountain Mortgage Finance I, LLC, Iron Mountain Receivables
QRS, LLC, Iron Mountain Receivables TRS, LLC, KH Data Capital Development Land, LLC, IM Mortgage
Solutions, LLC, Iron Mountain Fulfillment Services, LLC, First International Records Management
(F.I.R.M.), LLC, Iron Mountain Cloud, LLC and their respective direct and indirect Subsidiaries) and a
number of Iron Mountain’s non-U.S. Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries.”Iron Mountain’s non-U.S.
Restricted Subsidiaries will be “Excluded Restricted Subsidiaries” and will not Guarantee the Notes.
Furthermore, under the circumstances described below under the caption “—Certain covenants—
Designation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries,” Iron Mountain will be permitted to designate additional
Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Iron Mountain’s Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to
any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not Guarantee the Notes.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

On the date of the Indenture, Iron Mountain will issue $850,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of
Notes, or the Initial Notes, pursuant to the Indenture. Iron Mountain may issue additional notes to the


-----

Notes offered hereby, or the Additional Notes, from time to time after this offering subject to the covenant
described below under “—Certain covenants—Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock.”
The Initial Notes and the Additional Notes are collectively referred to herein as the Notes, unless the
context requires otherwise. The Initial Notes offered hereby will be treated, together with any Additional
Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture, as a single series under the Indenture except as otherwise
stated herein. We cannot guarantee that Additional Notes will be fungible with the Initial Notes for U.S.
federal income tax or other purposes, and, if the Additional Notes are not fungible with the Initial Notes for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, Iron Mountain will cause the Additional Notes to have a separate
CUSIP, ISIN, or other identification number from the Initial Notes. Unless the context requires otherwise,
references to “Notes”for all purposes of the Indenture and this description include any Additional Notes that
are actually issued.

The Notes will be issued in denominations of $2,000, or the Minimum Denomination, and any integral
multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes will be issued in registered form, without coupons. The Notes
will be evidenced by global Notes in book-entry form, except under the limited circumstances described
below under “—Book-entry, delivery and form.” The registered holder of a Note, or the Holder, will be
treated as the owner of such Note for all purposes. Only registered Holders will have rights under the
Indenture.

The Notes will mature on, 2031. Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of % per
annum. Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on and,
beginning on, 2021, to Holders of record on the immediately preceding and,
respectively. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or,
if no interest has been paid, from the date of issuance. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
comprised of twelve 30-day months.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

The Notes will be payable both as to principal and interest at the office or agency of Iron Mountain, or
appointed by Iron Mountain, maintained for such purpose or, at the option of Iron Mountain, payment of
interest or principal may be made by checks mailed to Holders at the addresses set forth in the register of
Holders. Until otherwise designated by Iron Mountain, Iron Mountain’s office or agency for payments on
the Notes will be the office of the paying agent maintained for such purpose.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Trustee will initially act as paying agent and registrar for the Notes. Iron Mountain may change
the paying agent or registrar without prior notice to Holders, and Iron Mountain or any of its Subsidiaries
may also act as paying agent or registrar from time to time.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The registrar and the
Trustee may require a Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer
documents. Iron Mountain may require a Holder to pay any taxes and fees required by law or by the Indenture
in connection with such transfer or exchange. Iron Mountain is not required to transfer or exchange any
Note selected for redemption. Also, Iron Mountain is not required to transfer or exchange any Note for a
period of 15 days before the delivery of a notice of redemption.

**Note Guarantees**

Iron Mountain’s payment obligations under the Notes initially will be jointly and severally guaranteed
on an unsecured senior basis by the Restricted Subsidiaries, other than the Excluded Restricted Subsidiaries.
See “—Certain covenants—Additional Note Guarantees.” The obligations of a Subsidiary Guarantor
under its Note Guarantee will be unconditional, but will contain language intended to prevent that Note
Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. See “Risk factors—Risks related
to our indebtedness—Federal and state statutes could allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void
guarantees and require holders of the Notes to return payments received from guarantors.”


-----

No newly created or acquired Restricted Subsidiary (other than an Excluded Restricted Subsidiary)
may, after the date of the Indenture, Guarantee the payment of (a) any Indebtedness of Iron Mountain or
any Subsidiary Guarantor under any Credit Facility or (b) any Indebtedness of Iron Mountain or any
Subsidiary Guarantor evidenced by bonds, notes or other debt securities in an aggregate principal amount
of $10.0 million or more, unless such Restricted Subsidiary shall also have executed a Note Guarantee and
delivered an opinion of counsel with respect thereto, in accordance with the terms of such Indenture. See
“—Certain covenants—Additional Note Guarantees.”

The Note Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will be released under the circumstances described
under “—Certain covenants—Additional Note Guarantees.”

**Optional Redemption**

Prior to, 2026, the Notes will be subject to redemption at any time at the option of Iron
Mountain, in whole or in part, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the Make-Whole
Price, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date.

On and after, 2026, Notes will be subject to redemption at any time at the option of Iron
Mountain, in whole or in part, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the redemption price
(expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but
excluding, the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning on
of the years indicated below:

**Year** **Notes Percentage**

2026 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . %

2028 and thereafter . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100.000%

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to, 2023, Iron Mountain may on any one
or more occasions redeem up to 40% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at a redemption price
of % of the principal amount thereof, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding,
the applicable redemption date, with cash in an amount not greater than the net cash proceeds of one or more
Qualified Equity Offerings; provided that:

(1) at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (excluding any Additional
Notes) issued under the Indenture remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such
redemption (excluding Notes held by Iron Mountain or any of its Subsidiaries) unless all Notes are
redeemed substantially concurrently; and

(2) the redemption occurs within six months of the date of the closing of any such Qualified
Equity Offering.

**Mandatory Redemption**

Iron Mountain is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments
with respect to the Notes.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

_Change of control._ Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each Holder will have the right to
require Iron Mountain to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in
excess thereof) of such Holder’s Notes pursuant to the offer described below, or the “Change of Control
Offer,” at an offer price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of repurchase, or the Change of Control Payment. In connection
with any Change of Control Offer, Iron Mountain may, in its sole discretion, elect to offer a premium, or
the Early Tender Premium, to holders of Notes who tender their Notes early in connection with such Change
of Control Offer; provided that the minimum payment offered to any holder of the Notes is no lower than
101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes


-----

repurchased to, but excluding, the date of purchase. In addition, Iron Mountain may determine, in its sole
discretion, to require as a condition to the receipt of such Early Tender Premium that holders (i) provide
consents to any requested amendments of the Indenture and (ii) waive any withdrawal rights in connection
with the Change of Control Offer.

Within 30 calendar days following any Change of Control, Iron Mountain will deliver a notice to each
Holder stating:

(1) that the Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “—Change
of control” and that all Notes properly tendered will be accepted for payment;

(2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 15 calendar days and
no later than 60 calendar days from the date such notice is delivered, or the Change of Control Payment
Date;

(3) that any Note not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

(4) that, unless Iron Mountain defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all
Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on
and after the Change of Control Payment Date;

(5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer
will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase”
on the reverse of the Notes completed, to the paying agent at the address specified in such notice prior to
the close of business on the fifth Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;

(6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the paying agent receives, not later
than the close of business on the second Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date,
facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of Notes
delivered for purchase and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its election to have such Notes
purchased; and

(7) that Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Notes equal in
principal amount to the unpurchased portion of such Notes surrendered, which unpurchased portion
must be equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.

Iron Mountain will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder, to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable to the
repurchase of the Notes in connection with a Change of Control. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture, Iron Mountain
will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its
obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such conflict.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, Iron Mountain will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment Notes or portions thereof tendered pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer;

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect
of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee or the paying agent the Notes so accepted
together with an Officers’ Certificate stating the Notes or portions thereof tendered to Iron Mountain.

The paying agent will promptly deliver to each Holder so accepted the Change of Control Payment
for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate, subject to the provisions of the Indenture, and
deliver to each such Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes
surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an
integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.


-----

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture will not contain
provisions that permit Holders to require that Iron Mountain repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event
of a takeover, recapitalization or similar restructuring, nor does it contain any other “event risk” protections
for Holders.

Although the Change of Control provision may not be waived by Iron Mountain, and may be waived
by the Trustee only in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, there can be no assurance that any
particular transaction (including a highly leveraged transaction) cannot be structured or effected in a manner
not constituting a Change of Control.

The Credit Agreement may limit the right of Iron Mountain to purchase any Notes prior to their
scheduled maturity. Also, a Change of Control may cause a default under the Credit Agreement. Any
future credit agreements or other agreements to which Iron Mountain becomes a party may contain similar
restrictions and provisions. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when Iron Mountain is
prohibited from purchasing Notes, Iron Mountain could seek a waiver of the default under the Credit
Agreement or the consent of its lenders to the purchase of Notes, or Iron Mountain could attempt to
refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If Iron Mountain does not obtain such waiver or
consent, or repay such borrowings, Iron Mountain would remain prohibited from purchasing Notes and Iron
Mountain would be in default under the Credit Agreement. In such case Iron Mountain’s failure to
purchase tendered Notes would, in turn, constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.

Iron Mountain will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if
(i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance
with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by Iron
Mountain and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer;
(ii) in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control, Iron Mountain or any third party
has made an offer to purchase (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all Notes validly tendered at a cash price equal
to or higher than the Change of Control Payment price and has purchased all Notes validly tendered and
not withdrawn under such Alternate Offer; or (iii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been
given pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of the Indenture, unless and until there is a default
in payment of the applicable redemption price.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made
in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a
definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

In connection with any Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such
offer and Iron Mountain, or any other Person making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of Iron Mountain,
purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, Iron Mountain or such
other Person will have the right (in their sole discretion), upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior
notice, given not more than 10 days after such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, to
redeem all Notes that remain outstanding after such purchase at a redemption price in cash equal to the
price offered to each other Holder of Notes in such offer, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to, but not
including, the date of redemption, subject to the right of Holders of record of the Notes on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.

The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of Iron
Mountain. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is
no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a Holder to
require Iron Mountain to repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other
disposition of less than all of the assets of Iron Mountain to another Person or group may be uncertain.

_Asset sales._ Iron Mountain will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) sell, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of any assets (including by way of a Sale and Leaseback
Transaction, but excluding a Qualifying Sale and Leaseback Transaction) other than (a) the sale, lease
or other transfer of real estate, products, inventory, services or accounts receivable in the ordinary course


-----

of business and any sale or other disposition of damaged, worn-out or obsolete assets in the ordinary
course of business (including the abandonment or other disposition of intellectual property that is, in the
reasonable judgment of Iron Mountain, no longer economically practicable to maintain or useful in
the conduct of the business of Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries taken as whole), (b) licenses
and sublicenses by Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary of software or intellectual property in
the ordinary course of business, (c) any surrender or waiver of contract rights or settlement, release,
recovery on or surrender of contract, tort or other claims in the ordinary course of business, (d) the
granting of Liens not prohibited by the covenant described below under the caption “—Certain
covenants—Liens” or (e) the sale or other disposition of cash or Cash Equivalents (provided that the
sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Iron Mountain will
be governed by the provisions of the Indenture described above under the caption “—Repurchase at
the option of Holders—Change of control” and/or the provisions described below under the caption
“—Certain covenants—Merger, consolidation or sale of assets” and not by the provisions of this
covenant); or

(2) issue or sell Equity Interests of any Restricted Subsidiary,

that, in the case of either clause (1) or (2) above, whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions:

(A) has a Fair Market Value in excess of $10.0 million; or

(B) results in Net Proceeds in excess of $10.0 million (each of the foregoing, an “Asset
Sale”),

unless (x) Iron Mountain (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the
time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of
and (y) at least 75% of the consideration therefor received by Iron Mountain or such Restricted Subsidiary
in the Asset Sale and all other Asset Sales since the Issue Date on a cumulative basis is in the form of (i) cash,
(ii) Cash Equivalents, (iii) like-kind assets, (iv) other assets used in or useful in Iron Mountain’s business or
(v) Designated Non-Cash Consideration having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (B)(y)(v) that is at the time
outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (i) $50.0 million and (ii) 1.0% of Consolidated Total Assets as of
the date of such Asset Sale (in each case as determined in good faith by Iron Mountain);

_provided, however, that the amount of any liabilities (as shown on Iron Mountain’s or such Restricted_
Subsidiary’s most recent balance sheet or in the notes thereto) of Iron Mountain or such Restricted Subsidiary
(other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or any Note Guarantee) that are
assumed by the transferee of any such assets, and any notes, securities or other obligations received by Iron
Mountain or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by Iron Mountain or
such Restricted Subsidiary into cash (to the extent of the cash received) or Cash Equivalents within 180 days
of such Asset Sale, shall be deemed to be cash for purposes of this provision; and provided, further, that the
75% limitation referred to in the foregoing clause (B)(y) shall not apply to any Asset Sale in which the cash
portion of the consideration received therefrom is equal to or greater than what the after-tax proceeds
would have been had such Asset Sale complied with the aforementioned 75% limitation. For the avoidance
of doubt, a disposition that constitutes a Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment will be governed by the
provisions of the Indenture described below under the covenant entitled “—Certain covenants—Restricted
payments” and not by the provisions of this covenant.

A transfer of assets or issuance of Equity Interests by Iron Mountain to a Restricted Subsidiary or by
a Restricted Subsidiary to Iron Mountain or to another Restricted Subsidiary will not be deemed to be an
Asset Sale.

Within 365 days of any Asset Sale, Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary may, at its option,
apply an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale either:

(1) to repay (a) Indebtedness and other obligations that are secured by a Lien or (b) Indebtedness
of a Restricted Subsidiary other than a Guarantor;


-----

(2) to an investment in another business or capital expenditure or to other long-term assets, in
each case, in the same line of business as Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary is then engaged
in businesses similar or reasonably related thereto;

(3) (a) to repay, prepay, redeem or purchase the Notes or (b) to repay other Indebtedness of Iron
Mountain or a Subsidiary Guarantor that ranks pari passu in right of payment with the Notes or any
Note Guarantee, as applicable, or Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided that, to the extent Iron Mountain
elects to repay such Pari Passu Indebtedness, Iron Mountain shall also equally and ratably, at its
option, (i) redeem the Notes pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of the Indenture; (ii) offer
to reduce Indebtedness under the Notes by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set
forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to Holders at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of
the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture; or (iii) purchase the Notes through privately
negotiated transactions or open market purchases in a manner that complies with the Indenture and
applicable securities law at a purchase price of at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the
amount of accrued but unpaid interest thereon up to the principal amount of Notes to be repurchased;
and/or

(4) a combination of the repayments and investments permitted by the foregoing clauses (1)
through (3).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset
Sale, Iron Mountain (or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) enters into a binding written agreement
irrevocably committing Iron Mountain or such Restricted Subsidiary to an application of funds of the
kind described in clause (2) above within 180 days of such contractual commitment (an “Acceptable
Commitment”), Iron Mountain or such Restricted Subsidiary shall be deemed not to be in violation of the
preceding paragraph so long as such application of funds is consummated within 545 days of the receipt of
such Net Proceeds. In the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any
reason before the Net Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute
Excess Proceeds (defined below) unless Iron Mountain or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another
Acceptable Commitment within 180 days of such cancellation or termination (a “Second Commitment”) and
such Net Proceeds are actually applied in such manner within 180 days from the date of the Second
Commitment; provided, further, that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any
reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds to the
extent 720 days have elapsed since the date of receipt of such Net Proceeds by Iron Mountain or a Restricted
Subsidiary.

Pending the final application of any such Net Proceeds, Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary
may temporarily reduce revolving credit Indebtedness or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner
that is not prohibited by the Indenture. On the 365th day after an Asset Sale or such earlier date (or a
later date if the Company has entered into an Acceptable Commitment as described in the immediately
preceding paragraph), if any, as the Board of Directors of Iron Mountain or of such Restricted Subsidiary
determines not to apply the Net Proceeds relating to such Asset Sale as set forth in clauses (1) through (4) of
the second preceding paragraph, or an Asset Sale Offer Trigger Date, such aggregate amount of Net
Proceeds (rounded down to the nearest $1,000) that has not been applied on or before such Asset Sale Offer
Trigger Date as permitted in clauses (1) through (4) of the second preceding paragraph or the last provision
of this paragraph, or an Asset Sale Offer Amount, shall be applied by Iron Mountain or such Restricted
Subsidiary to make an offer to purchase, or an Asset Sale Offer, to all Holders and, to the extent required
by the terms of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, to all holders of Pari Passu Indebtedness, on a date, or the Asset
Sale Offer Payment Date, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days following the applicable Asset Sale Offer
Trigger Date, from all Holders (and holders of any such Pari Passu Indebtedness) on a pro rata basis, the
maximum amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness equal to the Asset Sale Offer Amount at a price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased, plus
accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date of purchase.

Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries may defer an Asset Sale Offer until there is an aggregate
unutilized Asset Sale Offer Amount equal to or in excess of $25.0 million resulting from one or more Asset
Sales (at which time, the entire unutilized Asset Sale Offer Amount, and not just the amount in excess of


-----

$25.0 million, shall be applied as required pursuant to this covenant). Upon completion of an Asset Sale
Offer (including payment for accepted Notes), any surplus Excess Proceeds that were the subject of such offer
shall cease to be Excess Proceeds and the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset to zero.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and other Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered
pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Asset Sale Offer Amount, Iron Mountain or any Restricted
Subsidiary may use any remaining Asset Sale Offer Amount for general corporate purposes (including the
repurchase of Indebtedness contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes to the extent not
otherwise prohibited under the Indenture). If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other Pari Passu
Indebtedness surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the Asset Sale Offer Amount, the Trustee shall select
the Notes and other Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Notes
issued in global form, as discussed under “—Book-entry, delivery and form,” based on a method that most
nearly approximates a pro rata selection as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate), subject to the Minimum
Denomination, unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depositary requirements.
Upon completion of such offer to purchase, the Asset Sale Offer Amount shall be reset at zero.

Iron Mountain will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection
with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer and all other applicable federal and state
securities laws. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset
Sale provisions of the Indenture, Iron Mountain will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations
and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture
by virtue of such conflict. The Credit Agreement may limit the right of Iron Mountain or the Restricted
Subsidiaries to purchase any Notes prior to their scheduled maturity. Any future credit agreements or other
agreements to which Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries becomes a party may contain similar
restrictions and provisions. In the event an Asset Sale occurs at a time when Iron Mountain or the Restricted
Subsidiaries are prohibited from purchasing the Notes, Iron Mountain could seek the consent of its senior
lenders to the purchase of Notes, or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition.
If Iron Mountain does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, Iron Mountain and its Restricted
Subsidiaries would remain prohibited from purchasing such Notes. In such case, such failure to purchase
tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, constitute
a default under the Credit Agreement.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select Notes for redemption
on a pro rata basis or by lot (or, in the case of Notes issued in global form, based on a method that most nearly
approximates a pro rata selection as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate in accordance with DTC
guidelines) unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depositary requirements.

Notes of $2,000 or less shall not be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption shall be delivered by first
class mail or by electronic means at least 10 but (other than with respect to Notes redeemed in connection
with the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture) not more than 60 days before the redemption date to
each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address. Any such redemption or notice may, in Iron
Mountain’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, and, if so conditioned, the
redemption date for such Notes may be extended by Iron Mountain pending achievement of such condition
precedent.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to such Note shall
state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. A new Note in a principal amount equal
to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the
original Note. On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on Notes or portions thereof
called for redemption.

**Certain Covenants**

_Changes in covenants when Notes are rated investment grade. If on any date following the date of the_
Indenture:


-----

(1) at least two of the following events occurs with respect to the Notes:

(i) the Notes are rated Baa3 or better by Moody’s,

(ii) the Notes are rated BBB−or better by S&P, or

(iii) the Notes are rated BBB−or better by Fitch,

(or, if any such entity ceases to rate the Notes for reasons outside of the control of Iron Mountain, the
equivalent investment grade credit rating from any other “nationally recognized statistical rating
organization” registered under Section 15E of the Exchange Act selected by Iron Mountain as a
replacement agency); and

(2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing under the Indenture,
then, beginning on that date and continuing at all times thereafter regardless of any subsequent changes
in the rating of the Notes, (i) the covenants described under the following captions in this offering
memorandum will no longer be applicable as to the Notes and the related Note Guarantees and (ii) for
purposes of the provision of the Indenture described above under “—Repurchase at the option of
Holders—Change of control,” a Change of Control will only be deemed to occur with respect to the
Notes in the event of a Rating Decline:

(1) “—Repurchase at the option of Holders—Asset sales;”

(2) “—Restricted payments;”

(3) “—Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock;”

(4) “—Dividend and other payment restrictions affecting Restricted Subsidiaries;”

(5) “—Transactions with affiliates;”

(6) “—Additional Note Guarantees;”

(7) “—Designation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries;” and

(8) clause (4) of the covenant described below under the caption “—Merger, consolidation
or sale of assets.”

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such
rating, if achieved, will be maintained.

_Restricted payments. Iron Mountain will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly_
or indirectly:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on account of Iron Mountain’s Equity
Interests (other than dividends or distributions payable in Equity Interests of Iron Mountain (other
than Disqualified Stock));

(2) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests of Iron
Mountain;

(3) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire prior to the date that is one year prior to the
scheduled maturity for value any Indebtedness (excluding any intercompany Indebtedness between or
among Iron Mountain and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) that is contractually subordinated in right
of payment to the Notes or the Note Guarantees, except a payment of interest or principal at the
Stated Maturity thereof; or

(4) make any Investment other than a Permitted Investment (all such payments and other
actions set forth in clauses (1) through (4) above being collectively referred to as “Restricted Payments”);

unless, at the time of such Restricted Payment:

(i) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as
a consequence thereof;


-----

(ii) other than in respect of Restricted Payments as defined in clause (4) of the definition
thereof, Iron Mountain would, at the time of such Restricted Payment, on a Pro Forma Basis,
have been permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the test set forth
in the first paragraph of the covenant entitled “—Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of
preferred stock;” and

(iii) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate of all other Restricted Payments
made by Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries after October 1, 1996 (excluding Restricted
Payments permitted by clauses (2) through (11) of the next succeeding paragraph and any
Restricted Payments in respect of the defeasance, redemption, repurchase, retirement or other
acquisition or retirement for value of any Indebtedness prior to the date of the Indenture that would
have been contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes) would be less than (a) the
cumulative EBITDA of Iron Mountain, minus 1.4 times the cumulative Consolidated Interest
Expense of Iron Mountain, in each case for the period (taken as one accounting period) from
June 30, 1996, to the end of Iron Mountain’s most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal
financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment, plus (b) the aggregate
net Equity Proceeds received by Iron Mountain from the issuance or sale since October 1, 1996 of
Equity Interests of Iron Mountain or of debt securities of Iron Mountain that have been
converted into such Equity Interests (other than Equity Interests or convertible debt securities
sold to a Restricted Subsidiary and other than Disqualified Stock or debt securities that have been
converted into Disqualified Stock), plus (c) an amount equal to the net reduction in Investments
since October 1, 1996 (other than reductions in Permitted Investments) in any Person resulting from
payments of interest on Indebtedness, dividends, repayments of loans or advances, or other
transfers of assets, in each case to Iron Mountain or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or from the
net cash proceeds from the sale of any such Investment (except, in each case, to the extent any
such payment or proceeds have already been included in the calculation of cumulative EBITDA)
or from redesignations of Unrestricted Subsidiaries as Restricted Subsidiaries (valued in each case
as provided in the definition of “Investments”) not to exceed, in each case, the amount of
Investments previously made by Iron Mountain and its Restricted Subsidiaries in such Person),
plus (d) $2.0 million.

Assuming that (i) this offering and the application of the net proceeds from this offering as described
under “Use of proceeds” and (ii) the application of a portion of the net proceeds from the June 2020 Offering
to redeem in full the Senior Subordinated Notes, in each case had been completed on June 30, 2020, the
amount that would have been available to Iron Mountain for Restricted Payments pursuant to the foregoing
clause (iii) would have been approximately $5.1 billion.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit:

(1) the payment of any dividend or the consummation of any irrevocable repurchase, redemption,
defeasance or other acquisition or retirement within 60 days after the date of declaration of the dividend
or giving of the notice of repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement, as
the case may be, if at the date of declaration or notice, the dividend or repurchase, redemption, defeasance
or other acquisition or retirement would have complied with the provisions of the Indenture;

(2) the making of any Restricted Payment in exchange for, or with the net cash proceeds of, the
substantially concurrent sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of other Equity Interests of Iron
Mountain (other than any Disqualified Stock); provided that the amount of any such net cash proceeds
that are utilized for any such Restricted Payment will not be considered to be net Equity Proceeds for
purposes of clause (iii)(b) of the first paragraph of this covenant or clause (9) of this paragraph and will
not be considered to be net cash proceeds from a Qualified Equity Offering for purposes of the
“Optional Redemption” provisions of the Indenture;

(3) the defeasance, redemption, repurchase, retirement or other acquisition or retirement for
value of Indebtedness that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the Note
Guarantees, as applicable (including all accrued interest on the Indebtedness, all accrued and unpaid
dividends on Disqualified Stock, and the amount of all penalties, fees, costs, expenses, discounts and
premiums incurred in connection therewith and any original issue discount or debt issuance costs with


-----

respect thereto), in exchange for, or with the net cash proceeds of, the issuance and sale (other than to
Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary) of Refinancing Indebtedness not more than 90 days before
or after such defeasance, redemption, repurchase, retirement or other acquisition or retirement for
value;

(4) the repurchase of any Indebtedness contractually subordinated in right of payment to the
Notes or the Note Guarantees, as applicable, at a purchase price not greater than 101% of the principal
amount of such Indebtedness in the event of a Change of Control in accordance with provisions
similar to the “Change of control” covenant; provided that prior to or contemporaneously with such
repurchase Iron Mountain has made the Change of Control Offer as provided in such covenant with
respect to the Notes and has repurchased all Notes validly tendered for payment in connection with such
Change of Control Offer;

(5) the purchase, redemption, or other acquisition or retirement of Indebtedness subordinated in
right of payment to the Notes or any Note Guarantee (including all accrued interest on the Indebtedness,
all accrued and unpaid dividends on Disqualified Stock, and the amount of all penalties, fees, costs,
expenses, discounts and premiums incurred in connection therewith and any original issue discount or
debt issuance costs with respect thereto) (A) with any Excess Proceeds remaining after completion of an
Asset Sale Offer (assuming such Excess Proceeds were not reset at zero) or (B) at a purchase price not
greater than 100% of the principal amount of such Indebtedness, plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon in the event of Asset Sale, to the extent required by the terms of such Indebtedness; provided
that Iron Mountain shall have first complied with its obligations under “—Repurchase at the option of
Holders—Asset sales;”

(6) the repurchase of Equity Interests deemed to occur upon the exercise of stock options to the
extent such Equity Interests represent a portion of the exercise price of those stock options;

(7) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the declaration
and payment of regularly scheduled or accrued dividends to holders of any class or series of Disqualified
Stock of Iron Mountain or any preferred stock of any Restricted Subsidiary issued on or after the
date of the Indenture in accordance with the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test described below under
the caption “—Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock;”

(8) payments of cash, dividends, distributions, advances or other Restricted Payments by Iron
Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary to allow for the payment of cash in lieu of the issuance of
fractional shares upon (i) the exercise of options or warrants or (ii) the conversion or exchange of Capital
Stock of any such Person;

(9) additional payments to current or former employees, officers, directors or consultants (or
their respective transferees, estates or beneficiaries) of Iron Mountain or any of its Subsidiaries for
repurchases of stock, stock options or other equity interests in an aggregate amount up to $5.0 million
in any year, with unused amounts in any year permitted to be carried over to succeeding fiscal years;
_provided, further, that such amount in any year under this clause may be increased by an amount not to_
exceed:

(A) the net cash proceeds from the sale of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock)
of Iron Mountain and, to the extent contributed to Iron Mountain, the net cash proceeds from
the sale of Equity Interests of any parent of Iron Mountain, in each case, to any future, current or
former employees, officers, consultants or directors of Iron Mountain, any of its Subsidiaries, or
any parent of Iron Mountain that occurs after the Issue Date, to the extent the net cash proceeds
from the sale of such Equity Interests have not otherwise been applied to the payment of
Restricted Payments by virtue of clauses (i)—(iii) of the first paragraph of this covenant or by
virtue of clause (2) of this paragraph; plus

(B) the cash proceeds of key man life insurance policies received by Iron Mountain or its
Restricted Subsidiaries (or by any parent of Iron Mountain to the extent contributed to Iron
Mountain) after the Issue Date; minus


-----

(C) the amount of any Restricted Payments previously made with the cash proceeds
described in the foregoing sub-clauses (A) and (B) of this clause (9);

_provided that Iron Mountain may elect to apply all or any portion of the aggregate increase contemplated_
by sub-clauses (A) and (B) above in any twelve-month period;

(10) any Restricted Payment so long as after giving effect thereto, the Senior Leverage Ratio
would be less than 4.5 to 1.0; and

(11) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, other Restricted
Payments in an aggregate amount under this clause (11) since the date of the Indenture not to exceed
the greater of (x) $275.0 million and (y) 25% of Adjusted EBITDA (determined as of the date of any
Restricted Payment pursuant to this clause (11)).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Iron Mountain may declare or pay any dividend or make any
distribution on or in respect of shares of Iron Mountain’s Capital Stock to holders of such Capital Stock,
so long as Iron Mountain believes in good faith that it qualifies as a “real estate investment trust” under
Section 856 of the Code (or any successor provision) and that the declaration or payment of such dividend or
making of such distribution is necessary either (i) to maintain Iron Mountain’s status as a REIT for any
taxable year or (ii) to enable Iron Mountain to avoid payment of any tax for any taxable year that could be
avoided by reason of paying such dividend or making such distribution by Iron Mountain to its stockholders,
with such dividend to be paid or distribution to be made as and when determined by Iron Mountain,
whether during or after the end of the relevant taxable year.

If an Investment results in the making of a Restricted Payment, the aggregate amount of all Restricted
Payments deemed to have been made as calculated under the foregoing provision will be reduced by the
amount of any net reduction in such Investment (resulting from the payment of interest or dividends, loan
repayment, transfer of assets or otherwise) to the extent such net reduction is not included in Iron Mountain’s
EBITDA; provided, however, that the total amount by which the aggregate amount of all Restricted
Payments may be reduced may not exceed the lesser of (a) the cash proceeds received by Iron Mountain and
the Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such net reduction and (b) the initial amount of such
Investment. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt and to avoid double counting, if an Investment results
in the making of a Restricted Payment, then the subsequent assignment, contribution, distribution or other
transfer of such Investment by Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Excluded Restricted
Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiary shall not be considered a new Investment or Restricted Payment and
shall not further reduce the amount that would otherwise be available for Restricted Payments under
clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this section.

If the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments calculated under the foregoing provision includes
an Investment in an Unrestricted Subsidiary or other Person that thereafter becomes a Restricted Subsidiary,
such Investment will no longer be counted as a Restricted Payment for purposes of calculating the aggregate
amount of Restricted Payments.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment or
Investment (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories described in the third
paragraph of this covenant, or is permitted pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first paragraph of this
covenant, or pursuant to the definition of “Permitted Investments,” Iron Mountain will be entitled to divide
or classify (or later divide, classify or reclassify in whole or in part in its sole discretion) such Restricted
Payment or Investment (or, in each case, any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant.

For the purpose of making any Restricted Payment calculations under the Indenture:

(1) Investments will include the Fair Market Value of the net assets of any Restricted Subsidiary
at the time such Restricted Subsidiary is designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary and will exclude the
Fair Market Value of the net assets of any Unrestricted Subsidiary that is designated as a Restricted
Subsidiary and, for the avoidance of doubt, such inclusions and exclusions will not be limited by the
amount of any Investment or aggregate Investments;

(2) any asset or property transferred to or from an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be valued at Fair
Market Value at the time of such transfer; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Fair Market


-----

Value (as so determined) of such asset or property shall be subtracted from (in the case of a transfer to
an Unrestricted Subsidiary) or added to (in the case of a transfer from an Unrestricted Subsidiary)
the calculation under clause (iii) of the first paragraph of this covenant; and

(3) the amount of any Restricted Payment, if other than cash, will be determined by Iron
Mountain, whose good faith determination will be conclusive.

Iron Mountain’s Board of Directors may designate a Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary
in compliance with the covenant entitled “—Designation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Upon such
designation, all outstanding Investments by Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the
extent repaid in cash) in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments made at the
time of such designation. Such designation will only be permitted if such Restricted Payment would be
permitted at such time and if such Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary.

_Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock._ Iron Mountain will not, and will not
permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, Guarantee or
otherwise become directly or indirectly liable with respect to (or, collectively, “incur”) any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Debt) and Iron Mountain will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to issue any shares
of preferred stock; provided, however, that Iron Mountain may incur Indebtedness and may permit a
Restricted Subsidiary to incur Indebtedness or issue preferred stock if, at the time of such incurrence or
issuance and after giving effect thereto on a Pro Forma Basis (including a pro forma application of the net
proceeds therefrom), the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the four full fiscal quarters immediately preceding
such incurrence or issuance for which internal financial statements are available, taken as one period,
would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0.

The foregoing limitations will not apply to:

(1) the incurrence by Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness and letters of
credit under Credit Facilities in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding under this
clause (1) (with letters of credit being deemed to have a principal amount equal to the maximum potential
liability of Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries thereunder) not to exceed $3,260.0 million;

(2) the issuance of the Note Guarantees on the date of the Indenture;

(3) the incurrence by Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries of the Existing Indebtedness;

(4) the issuance of the Notes on the date of the Indenture;

(5) the incurrence by Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries of Capital Lease Obligations,
mortgage financings and/or Indebtedness constituting purchase money obligations, including all
Refinancing Indebtedness incurred with respect thereto, up to an aggregate at any one time outstanding
of the greater of (i) $250.0 million and (ii) 5.0% of Consolidated Total Assets as of any date of
incurrence;

(6) the incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness or preferred stock between (i) Iron Mountain or
the Restricted Subsidiaries and (ii) the Restricted Subsidiaries;

(7) the incurrence by Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries of Hedging Obligations not
for purposes of speculation;

(8) the incurrence by Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of performance
bonds, bankers’ acceptances, workers’ compensation claims, surety, bid, appeal or similar bonds,
completion guarantees, payment obligations in connection with self-insurance or similar obligations,
and bank overdrafts (and letters of credit in respect thereof) in the ordinary course of business;

(9) the incurrence by Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness consisting
of “earn-out” obligations, Guarantees, indemnities or obligations in respect of purchase price
adjustments in connection with the acquisition or disposition of assets, including, without limitation,
shares of Capital Stock;


-----

(10) the incurrence by Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness arising from
the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument inadvertently
drawn against insufficient funds, so long as such Indebtedness is covered within five business days;

(11) the Guarantee by Iron Mountain or any Subsidiary Guarantor of Indebtedness of Iron
Mountain or a Restricted Subsidiary and the Guarantee by any non-Guarantor Subsidiary of
Indebtedness of another non-Guarantor Subsidiary, in each case, to the extent that the Guaranteed
Indebtedness was permitted to be incurred by another provision of this covenant; provided that if the
Indebtedness being Guaranteed is contractually subordinated to the Notes or the Note Guarantees, as
applicable, then the Guarantee must be subordinated to the same extent as the Indebtedness
Guaranteed;

(12) the incurrence by Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries of Refinancing
Indebtedness issued in exchange for, or the proceeds of which are used to repay, redeem, defease,
extend, refinance, renew, replace or refund, Indebtedness (other than intercompany Indebtedness)
referred to in clauses (2) through (5) above, this clause (12) or clause (13) below or that was otherwise
permitted to be incurred pursuant to the test set forth in the first paragraph of this covenant;

(13) the incurrence by Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary of additional Indebtedness in
an aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) at any time outstanding, including all
permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge
any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (13), not to exceed $50.0 million;

(14) Acquired Debt and any other Indebtedness incurred to finance a merger, consolidation or
other acquisition; provided that on a Pro Forma Basis, either (A) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
would be equal to or greater than the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio immediately prior to such merger,
consolidation or other acquisition or (B) Iron Mountain would have been able to incur at least $1.00 of
additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant;

(15) Indebtedness the net proceeds of which have been deposited in escrow to finance the
repayment or redemption of such Indebtedness pursuant to customary escrow arrangements pending
the release thereof;

(16) Indebtedness that has been discharged;

(17) Indebtedness deemed to exist pursuant to the terms of a Joint Venture agreement as a result
of a failure of Iron Mountain or a Restricted Subsidiary to make a required capital contribution therein;
_provided that the only recourse on such Indebtedness is limited to Iron Mountain’s or such Restricted_
Subsidiary’s equity interests in the related Joint Venture;

(18) (i) Indebtedness representing deferred compensation to employees of Iron Mountain or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries incurred in the ordinary course of business, and (ii) Indebtedness consisting
of obligations of Iron Mountain or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries under deferred compensation or
other similar arrangements incurred by such Person in connection with any Investment permitted under
the covenant described above under the caption “—Restricted payments;” and

(19) Indebtedness of Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary in an aggregate principal
amount up to 100% of the Equity Proceeds received by Iron Mountain after the Issue Date from the
issue or sale of Equity Interests of Iron Mountain or cash contributed to the capital of Iron Mountain
(in each case, other than proceeds of Disqualified Stock or sales of Equity Interests to Iron Mountain
or any of its Subsidiaries) to the extent such Equity Proceeds have not been applied pursuant to clause
(iii)(b) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Restricted Payments,” or clause (2)
or clause (9) of the third paragraph of such covenant, to make Restricted Payments, and provided that
any such Equity Proceeds shall be excluded for purposes of making Restricted Payments pursuant to any
of clause (iii)(b) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Restricted Payments,” or
clause (2) or clause (9) of the third paragraph of such covenant, to the extent Iron Mountain or any
Restricted Subsidiary incur Indebtedness in reliance thereon.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Restricted Subsidiaries that are non-Guarantor Subsidiaries will not
be permitted to incur Indebtedness or issue preferred stock pursuant to the first paragraph of this


-----

“—Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock” covenant or clause (13) above if, after
giving effect to such incurrence or issuance, the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness of such
Restricted Subsidiaries that are non-Guarantor Subsidiaries (excluding intercompany Indebtedness between
or among Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries) outstanding pursuant to such first paragraph or
such clause, together with the aggregate liquidation preference of preferred stock issued by such Restricted
Subsidiaries that are non-Guarantor Subsidiaries (excluding intercompany preferred stock issued between
or among Iron Mountain and the Restricted Subsidiaries) outstanding pursuant to such provisions, would
exceed the greater of (x) $1.25 billion and (y) 1.25x Adjusted EBITDA as of any date of incurrence.

Iron Mountain will not incur, and Iron Mountain will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to incur,
any Indebtedness that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of Iron
Mountain or such Subsidiary Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right
of payment to the Notes and the applicable Note Guarantee on substantially identical terms; provided,
_however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any_
other Indebtedness of Iron Mountain or a Subsidiary Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by
virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis.

For purposes of determining compliance with this “—Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of
preferred stock” covenant, for the avoidance of doubt, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the
criteria of more than one of the categories of permitted debt described in clauses (1) through (19) above, or
is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, Iron Mountain will be permitted
to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence, or later reclassify all or a portion of such
item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this covenant. Indebtedness under the Credit
Agreement outstanding on the date on which Notes are first issued and authenticated under the Indenture
will at all times be deemed to have been incurred on such date in reliance on the exception provided by clause
(1) above. The accrual of interest or preferred stock dividends, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness with the
same terms, the reclassification of preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles
and the payment of dividends on preferred stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the
same class of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness
or an issuance of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant; provided, in each
such case, that the amount thereof is included in the Consolidated Interest Expense of Iron Mountain as
accrued.

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. Dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence
of Indebtedness, the U.S. Dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a currency
other than U.S. Dollars will be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
such Indebtedness was incurred; provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred to extend, replace, refund,
refinance, renew or defease, or that is exchanged for, other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than
U.S. Dollars, and such extension, replacement, refunding, refinancing, renewal, defeasance or exchange
would cause the applicable U.S. Dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such extension, replacement, refunding, refinancing, renewal,
defeasance or exchange, such U.S. Dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been
exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal
amount of such Indebtedness being extended, replaced, refunded, refinanced, renewed, defeased or exchanged.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that Iron
Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be
exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values.

The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:

(1) the accreted value of the Indebtedness, in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original
issue discount;

(2) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and

(3) in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified
Person, the lesser of:

(i) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and

(ii) the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person.


-----

In connection with the incurrence of (i) revolving loan Indebtedness under this covenant or (ii) any
commitment relating to the incurrence of Indebtedness under this covenant and (in respect of both (i) and
(ii)) the granting of any Lien to secure any such Indebtedness, Iron Mountain or the applicable Restricted
Subsidiary may designate, such incurrence and the granting of any such Lien as having occurred on the
date of first incurrence of such revolving loan Indebtedness or commitment (such date, the “Deemed Date”),
and any related subsequent actual incurrence or granting of any such Lien therefor will be deemed for all
purposes under the Indenture to have been incurred or granted on such Deemed Date, including, without
limitation, for purposes of calculating the Senior Leverage Ratio and usage of any other baskets or ratios
under the Indenture (as applicable).

The amount of Indebtedness that may be incurred pursuant to any provision of this covenant or
secured pursuant to the covenant described below under “—Liens,” (i) shall be deemed to include all
amounts necessary to renew, refund, redeem, refinance, replace, restructure, defease or discharge any such
Indebtedness incurred and/or secured pursuant to such provisions, including after giving effect to additional
Indebtedness in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of fees, premia, underwriting discounts and
other costs and expenses incurred in connection with such renewal, refund, redemption, refinancing,
replacement, restructuring, defeasance or discharge; and (ii) in any case where such amounts are or may be
based on Consolidated Total Assets or Adjusted EBITDA (or any ratio of which Adjusted EBITDA is a
component), shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to such incurrence or grant of Lien, due
solely to the result of fluctuations in the amount of Consolidated Total Assets or Adjusted EBITDA (and,
for the avoidance of doubt, such Indebtedness and such Lien will be permitted to be refinanced or replaced
notwithstanding that, after giving effect to such refinancing or replacement, such excess will continue).

_Liens._ Neither Iron Mountain nor any Restricted Subsidiary may directly or indirectly create, incur,
assume or suffer to exist any Lien securing Indebtedness (other than a Permitted Lien) upon any property
or assets now owned or hereafter acquired, or any income, profits or proceeds therefrom, or assign or otherwise
convey any right to receive income therefrom, unless (a) in the case of any Lien securing any Indebtedness
that is contractually subordinated to the Notes or any Note Guarantee, as applicable, the Notes or any such
Note Guarantee are secured by a Lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior in priority to
such Lien and (b) in the case of any other Lien securing Indebtedness, the Notes or the applicable Note
Guarantee are equally and ratably secured with the obligation or liability secured by such Lien.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (i) a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness
need not be permitted solely by reference to one category of Permitted Liens (or any portion thereof)
described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant but may
be permitted in part under any combination thereof and (ii) in the event that a Lien securing an item of
Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of one or more of the categories of Permitted Liens
(or any portion thereof) described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” or pursuant to the first paragraph
of this covenant, Iron Mountain may, in its sole discretion, classify or reclassify, or later divide, classify or
reclassify (as if incurred or issued at such later time), such Lien securing such item of Indebtedness (or any
portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant and at the time of incurrence, issuance,
classification or reclassification will be entitled to only include the amount and type of such Lien or such
item of Indebtedness secured by such Lien (or any portion thereof) in one of the categories of Permitted Liens
(or any portion thereof) described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” or pursuant to the first paragraph
of this covenant and, in such event, such Lien securing such item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) will
be treated as being incurred, issued or existing pursuant to only such clause or clauses (or any portion
thereof) or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant without including such item (or portion thereof)
when calculating the amount of Liens or Indebtedness that may be incurred or issued pursuant to any
other clause or paragraph (or portion thereof) at such time.

With respect to any revolving loan Indebtedness or commitment relating to the incurrence of
Indebtedness that is designated to be incurred on any date pursuant to the covenant described under the
caption “—Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock,” any Lien that does or that shall
secure such Indebtedness may also be designated by Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary to be
incurred on such date and, in such event, any related subsequent actual incurrence of such Lien shall be
deemed for all purposes under the Indenture to be incurred on such prior date, including for purposes of
calculating usage of any “Permitted Lien.”


-----

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the
time of the incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased
Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the
amount of such Indebtedness that is not deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the
covenant described under the caption “—Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock.”

_Dividend and other payment restrictions affecting Restricted Subsidiaries._ Iron Mountain will not,
and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to
exist or become effective any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) (i) pay dividends or make any other distributions to Iron Mountain or any Restricted
Subsidiary (A) on its Capital Stock or (B) with respect to any other interest or participation in, or
measured by, its profits, or (ii) pay any Indebtedness owed to Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) make loans or advances to Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(3) transfer any of its properties or assets to Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary.

However, the preceding restrictions will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by
reason of:

(1) agreements governing Existing Indebtedness as in effect as of the date of the Indenture, and
any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements
or refinancings thereof; provided that such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals,
increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are no more restrictive in the aggregate
with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in the agreements
governing Existing Indebtedness as in effect on the date of the Indenture;

(2) the Credit Agreement as in effect as of the date of the Indenture, and any amendments,
modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings
thereof; provided that such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements,
refundings, replacements or refinancings are no more restrictive in the aggregate with respect to such
dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in the Credit Agreement as in effect on
the date of the Indenture;

(3) the Indenture and the Notes;

(4) applicable law, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any applicable rule, regulation or order;

(5) any instrument governing Indebtedness or Capital Stock of a Person acquired by Iron
Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary as in effect at the time of such acquisition (except to the extent
such Indebtedness was incurred in connection with or in contemplation of such acquisition), which
encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person,
other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired; provided that, in the case of
Indebtedness, such Indebtedness was permitted by the terms of the Indenture to be incurred;

(6) customary non-assignment provisions in contracts, licenses or leases entered into in the
ordinary course of business and consistent with past practices;

(7) any agreement for the sale or other disposition of a Restricted Subsidiary that restricts
distributions by that Restricted Subsidiary pending its sale or other disposition;

(8) restrictions on the transfer of property subject to mortgages, purchase money obligations or
Capital Lease Obligations otherwise permitted by clause (5) of the covenant entitled “—Incurrence of
indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock;”

(9) permitted Refinancing Indebtedness; provided that the restrictions contained in the agreements
governing such Refinancing Indebtedness are no more restrictive in the aggregate than those contained
in the agreements governing the Indebtedness being refinanced;


-----

(10) Liens permitted to be incurred under the provisions of the covenant described above under
the caption “—Liens” that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets subject to such Liens;

(11) provisions limiting the disposition or distribution of assets or property in joint venture
agreements, asset sale agreements, sale-leaseback agreements, stock sale agreements and other similar
agreements (including agreements entered into in connection with a Permitted Investment) entered into
with the approval of Iron Mountain’s Board of Directors, which limitation is applicable only to the
assets that are the subject of such agreements;

(12) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under contracts
entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(13) agreements governing other Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the provisions of
the covenant described above under the caption “—Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred
stock” and any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals, supplements, refundings,
replacements or refinancings of those agreements; provided that the restrictions therein will not
materially affect Iron Mountain’s ability to make anticipated principal or interest payments on the
Notes (as determined in good faith by senior management or the Board of Directors of Iron Mountain);
and

(14) any Lien or restriction on a Securitization Subsidiary that, in the good faith judgment of
senior management or the Board of Directors of Iron Mountain, is reasonably required in connection
therewith; provided, however, that such restrictions only apply to Securitization Subsidiaries.

_Merger, consolidation or sale of assets._ Iron Mountain may not consolidate or merge with or into
(whether or not Iron Mountain is the surviving entity), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets in one or more related transactions, to another
Person unless:

(1) either: (i) Iron Mountain is the surviving entity or (ii) the Person formed by or surviving any
such consolidation or merger (if other than Iron Mountain) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer,
lease, conveyance or other disposition shall have been made is an entity organized or existing under
the laws of the U.S., any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

(2) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than Iron
Mountain), or the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition
shall have been made, assumes all the obligations of Iron Mountain under the Notes and the Indenture
(pursuant to a supplemental indenture in a form satisfactory to the Trustee);

(3) immediately after such transaction no Default or Event of Default exists; and

(4) either (a) Iron Mountain or any Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or
merger, or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition shall have
been made, will, at the time of such transaction and on a Pro Forma Basis, be permitted to incur at least
$1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant
entitled “—Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock” or (b) at the time of such sale,
assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition shall have been made on a Pro Forma
Basis, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would have been equal to or greater than the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio immediately prior to such transaction.

This “—Merger, consolidation or sale of assets” covenant will not apply to any sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition of assets between or among Iron Mountain and the
Restricted Subsidiaries. Clauses (3) and (4) of the first paragraph of this covenant will not apply to any
consolidation or merger of Iron Mountain (i) with or into a Restricted Subsidiary for any purpose or (ii) with
or into an Affiliate solely for the purpose of reincorporating Iron Mountain in another jurisdiction in the
U.S.

_Transactions with affiliates._ Iron Mountain will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to,
sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets
from, or enter into any contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or Guarantee with, or for the


-----

benefit of, any Affiliate, each of the foregoing, an Affiliate Transaction, involving aggregate payments or
consideration made by Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary in excess of $25.0 million, unless:

(a) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to Iron Mountain or such
Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by Iron
Mountain or such Restricted Subsidiary with a non-Affiliated Person; and

(b) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction involving aggregate payments in excess of
$200.0 million, Iron Mountain delivers to the Trustee a resolution of Iron Mountain’s Board of
Directors set forth in an Officers’ Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with
clause (a) above and such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the disinterested members
of Iron Mountain’s Board of Directors.

The following items shall not be deemed Affiliate Transactions and therefore, will not be subject to the
provisions of the prior paragraph:

(1) any employment agreement, employee benefit plan, officer or director indemnification
agreement or any similar arrangement entered into by Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary in
the ordinary course of business and payments thereto;

(2) transactions between or among Iron Mountain and one or more Restricted Subsidiaries;

(3) transactions with a Person (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary) that is an Affiliate of Iron
Mountain solely because Iron Mountain owns, directly or through a Restricted Subsidiary, an Equity
Interest in, or controls, such Person;

(4) payment of reasonable and customary fees and reimbursements of expenses (pursuant to
indemnity arrangements or otherwise) of officers, directors, employees or consultants of Iron Mountain
or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any issuance of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of Iron Mountain to
Affiliates of Iron Mountain;

(6) Restricted Payments and Permitted Investments that do not violate the provisions of the
Indenture described above under the caption “—Restricted payments;”

(7) payments to an Affiliate in respect of the Notes or any other Indebtedness of Iron Mountain
or any Restricted Subsidiary on the same basis as concurrent payments made or offered to be made in
respect thereof to non-Affiliates;

(8) loans or advances to employees in the ordinary course of business not to exceed $1.0 million
in the aggregate at any one time outstanding;

(9) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Securitization Facility or any transaction
involving the transfer of Receivables of the type specified in the definition of “Credit Facilities” and
permitted under paragraph (1) of the covenant entitled “—Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of
preferred stock”;

(10) any transfers by Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary to, and any lease entered into
by Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary with, a wholly owned Unrestricted Subsidiary in
connection with a Sale and Leaseback Transaction permitted under the Indenture;

(11) transactions with Joint Ventures and Subsidiaries thereof and Unrestricted Subsidiaries that
are approved by a majority of the disinterested members of Iron Mountain’s Board of Directors (or by
the audit committee or any committee of the Board of Directors consisting of disinterested members
of the Board of Directors) (a director shall be disinterested if he or she has no interest in such Joint
Venture or Unrestricted Subsidiary other than through Iron Mountain and its Restricted Subsidiaries);

(12) any transaction with respect to which Iron Mountain or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
obtains an opinion as to the fairness to Iron Mountain or such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, of


-----

such Affiliate Transaction from a financial point of view issued by an accounting, appraisal or
investment banking firm of national standing;

(13) transactions with a Person who is not an Affiliate immediately before the consummation of
such transaction that becomes an Affiliate as a result of such transaction;

(14) any lease entered into between Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary, as lessee and
any Affiliate of Iron Mountain, as lessor, which is approved by the Board of Directors of Iron Mountain
in good faith, or any lease entered into between Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary, as lessee,
and any Affiliate of Iron Mountain, as lessor, in the ordinary course of business;

(15) intellectual property licenses in the ordinary course of business;

(16) payments to and from, and transactions with, any Joint Ventures entered into in the
ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice (including, including without limitation,
any cash management activities related thereto);

(17) the payment of reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses relating to registration rights
and indemnities provided to stockholders of Iron Mountain or any parent of Iron Mountain pursuant
to a stockholders agreement or a registration rights agreement entered into on or after the Issue Date
in connection therewith or similar equity holder’s agreements or limited liability company agreements;
and

(18) transactions between Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Person, which is
an Affiliate solely due to a director or directors of such Person (or a parent company of such Person)
also being a director of Iron Mountain; provided, however, that any such director abstains from voting as
a director of Iron Mountain on any matter involving such other Person.

_Additional Note Guarantees._ No Restricted Subsidiary (other than an Excluded Restricted Subsidiary
and, following the release or termination of all Guarantees by a Foreign Subsidiary Holdco of any
Indebtedness of Iron Mountain or its other Subsidiaries other than the Notes, such Foreign Subsidiary
Holdco) may, after the date of the Indenture, Guarantee the payment of (a) any Indebtedness of Iron
Mountain or any Subsidiary Guarantor under any Credit Facility or (b) any Indebtedness of Iron Mountain
or any Subsidiary Guarantor evidenced by bonds, notes or other debt securities in an aggregate principal
amount of $10.0 million of more, unless such Restricted Subsidiary shall also execute within 60 days following
the date on which such requirement arose a Note Guarantee and deliver an opinion of counsel and
Officers’ Certificate to the Trustee with respect thereto, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.

No Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate or merge with or into (whether or not such Subsidiary
Guarantor is the surviving Person) another Person (other than Iron Mountain), whether or not affiliated
with such Subsidiary Guarantor unless:

(1) subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, the Person formed by or surviving any
such consolidation or merger (if other than such Subsidiary Guarantor) assumes all the obligations of
such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Note Guarantee pursuant to a supplemental indenture in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee; and

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists.

The Note Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will automatically be released:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Capital Stock of that Subsidiary Guarantor
by way of consolidation, merger or otherwise to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect
to such transaction) Iron Mountain or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition does
not violate the covenant described under the caption “—Repurchase at the option of Holders—Asset
sales” and such Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the sale or other
disposition;

(2) in connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that
Subsidiary Guarantor by way of consolidation, merger or otherwise to a Person that is not (either before


-----

or after giving effect to such transaction) Iron Mountain or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other
disposition does not violate the covenant described above under “—Repurchase at the option of
Holders—Asset sales,” and the Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of
the sale or other disposition;

(3) if Iron Mountain designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(4) upon legal defeasance or covenant defeasance of the Notes as provided below under the
caption “—Legal defeasance and covenant defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and discharge;”

(5) upon the release or discharge of the guarantee by, or direct obligation of, such Guarantor of
the Indebtedness that resulted in the creation of such Note Guarantee, except a discharge or release by
or as a result of payment under such guarantee or direct obligation (it being understood that a
release subject to a contingent reinstatement will constitute a release for the purposes of this provision,
and that if any such guarantee is so reinstated, such Note Guarantee shall also be reinstated to the
extent that such Guarantor would then be required to provide a Note Guarantee pursuant to the first
paragraph of this covenant);

(6) upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into Iron
Mountain or another Guarantor or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor, in each case, in compliance
with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; or

(7) for any Foreign Subsidiary Holdco, concurrently with the release or termination of all
Guarantees by such Foreign Subsidiary Holdco of any Indebtedness of Iron Mountain or its other
Subsidiaries other than the Notes.

_Designation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries._ Iron Mountain’s Board of Directors may designate any
Subsidiary (including any Restricted Subsidiary or any newly acquired or newly formed Subsidiary) to be
an Unrestricted Subsidiary so long as:

(1) any Investment in such Subsidiary deemed to be made as a result of designating such
Subsidiary an Unrestricted Subsidiary will not violate the provisions of the covenant entitled
“—Restricted payments;” and

(2) neither Iron Mountain nor any Restricted Subsidiary has any obligation to subscribe for
additional shares of Capital Stock or other Equity Interests in such Subsidiary, or to maintain or
preserve such Subsidiary’s financial condition or to cause such Subsidiary to achieve certain levels of
operating results other than as permitted under the covenant entitled “—Restricted payments.”

For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this covenant shall not limit or restrict the ability of any
Restricted Subsidiary to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any properties or assets to any other Subsidiary,
including any Unrestricted Subsidiary, to the extent such sale, transfer or other disposition is permitted by
the provisions of the Indenture described above under the covenants entitled “—Repurchase at the option of
Holders—Asset sales” or “—Transactions with affiliates.”

Iron Mountain’s Board of Directors may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted
Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a
Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary and such designation
will only be permitted if:

(1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the “—Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of
preferred stock” covenant; and

(2) no Default or Event of Default would occur as a result of such designation.

_Reports._ Whether or not required by the rules and regulations of the SEC, so long as any Notes are
outstanding, Iron Mountain will furnish to Holders (or file with the SEC for public availability), within the
time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations:


-----

(1) all quarterly and annual financial information that would be required to be contained in a
filing with the SEC on Forms 10-Q and 10-K if Iron Mountain were required to file such Forms,
including a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
and, with respect to the annual information only, a report thereon by Iron Mountain’s certified
independent accountants; and

(2) all financial information that would be required to be included in a Form 8-K filed with the
SEC if Iron Mountain were required to file such reports.

In addition, whether or not required by the rules and regulations of the SEC, Iron Mountain will file a
copy of all such information and reports with the SEC for public availability (unless the SEC will not accept
such a filing) and make such information available to investors who request it in writing.

Iron Mountain will not take any action for the purpose of causing the SEC not to accept any such
filings. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, the SEC will not accept Iron Mountain’s filings for any reason,
Iron Mountain will post the reports referred to in the preceding paragraphs on its website within the time
periods that would apply if Iron Mountain were required to file those reports with the SEC. The Trustee shall
have no liability or responsibility for the filing, content or timeliness of any such report.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time the Notes are Guaranteed by any direct or indirect
parent company of Iron Mountain, Iron Mountain will satisfy its obligations under this covenant with
respect to financial information relating to Iron Mountain by furnishing financial information relating to
such direct or indirect parent company; provided, however, that the same is accompanied by consolidating
information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such direct
or indirect parent company and any of its Subsidiaries other than Iron Mountain and its Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and the information relating to Iron Mountain, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the other
Subsidiaries of Iron Mountain on a standalone basis, on the other hand.

Notwithstanding the provisions of the Indenture described under “—Events of default and remedies,”
except as provided in the second to last sentence of this paragraph, the sole remedy for any failure to comply
by Iron Mountain with this covenant shall be the payment of liquidated damages as described in the
following sentence, such failure to comply shall not constitute an Event of Default, and Holders shall not
have any right to accelerate the maturity of the Notes as a result of any such failure to comply. If a failure to
comply by Iron Mountain with this covenant is continuing on the day that is 60 days following Iron
Mountain’s receipt of notice of such failure to comply in accordance with clause (4) of the provisions of the
Indenture described under “—Events of default and remedies,”(such notice, the “Reports Default Notice”),
Iron Mountain will pay liquidated damages to all Holders at a rate per annum equal to 0.25% of the principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding from such date to, but not including, the earlier of (x) the 121st day
following Iron Mountain’s receipt of the Reports Default Notice and (y) the date on which the failure to
comply by Iron Mountain with this covenant shall have been cured or waived. On the earlier of the dates
specified in the immediately preceding clauses (x) and (y), such liquidated damages will cease to accrue. If the
failure to comply by Iron Mountain with this covenant shall not have been cured or waived on or before
the 121st day following Iron Mountain’s receipt of the Reports Default Notice, then the failure to comply
by Iron Mountain with this covenant shall on such 121st day constitute an Event of Default. A failure to
comply with this covenant automatically shall cease to be continuing and shall be deemed cured at such time
as Iron Mountain furnishes to the Trustee the applicable information or report; provided, however, that the
Trustee shall have no obligation whatsoever to determine whether or not such information, documents or
reports have been filed pursuant to the EDGAR service (or its successor) nor shall the Trustee have any
liability or responsibility for the content of such reports.

**Financial Calculations for Limited Condition Transactions**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture, in each case in
connection with a Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith (including
any incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock and the use of proceeds
thereof and any Restricted Payments), the date of determination of such basket or ratio and of any Default
or Event of Default may, at the option of Iron Mountain, be the date the definitive agreement(s) for such
Limited Condition Transaction is entered into. Any such ratio or basket shall be calculated on a Pro Forma


-----

Basis after giving effect to such Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions in connection
therewith (including any incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock and
the use of proceeds thereof and any Restricted Payments) as if they had been consummated at the beginning
of the applicable period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such Limited Condition
Transaction; provided that if Iron Mountain elects to make such determination as of the date of such
definitive agreement(s), then (x) Iron Mountain shall be deemed to be in compliance with such ratios or
baskets solely for purposes of determining whether the Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions
in connection therewith (including any incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
preferred stock and the use of proceeds thereof and any Restricted Payments), is permitted under the
Indenture, and (y) such ratios or baskets shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such Limited
Condition Transaction or related transactions; provided, further, that if Iron Mountain elects to have such
determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement(s), any such transactions (including
any incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock and the use of proceeds
thereof and any Restricted Payments) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreement(s)
is entered into and shall be deemed outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any ratios or baskets
under the Indenture after the date of such definitive agreement(s) and before the consummation of such
Limited Condition Transaction, unless such definitive agreement(s) is terminated or such Limited
Condition Transaction, incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock,
Restricted Payment or such other transaction to which pro forma effect is being given does not occur. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall have no liability or responsibility for any calculation under or in
connection with the Indenture.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

Each of the following constitutes an “Event of Default” with respect to the Notes:

(1) default for 30 days in payment when due of interest with respect to the Notes;

(2) default in payment when due of the principal of or premium, if any, on the Notes;

(3) failure by Iron Mountain to comply with the provisions described under “—Repurchase at
the option of Holders—Change of control” with respect to the Notes;

(4) failure by Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary for 60 days after written notice from
the Trustee or Holders of not less than 25% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes to comply with any of its other agreements applicable to the Notes in the Indenture, the Notes
or the Note Guarantees;

(5) the failure to pay at final maturity (giving effect to any applicable grace periods and any
extensions thereof) the stated principal amount of any Indebtedness of Iron Mountain or any Restricted
Subsidiary, or the acceleration of the final stated maturity of any such Indebtedness (which acceleration
is not rescinded, annulled or otherwise cured within 30 days of receipt by Iron Mountain or such
Restricted Subsidiary of notice of any such acceleration) if the aggregate principal amount of such
Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness in default for failure
to pay principal at final stated maturity or which has been so accelerated (in each case with respect to
which the 30-day period described above has passed), equals $200.0 million or more at any time;

(6) failure by Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in
excess of $200.0 million, which judgments remain unpaid, undischarged or unstayed for a period of
60 days;

(7) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to Iron Mountain or any Restricted
Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary; and

(8) except as permitted by the Indenture or the Note Guarantees, any Note Guarantee shall be
held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or shall cease for any reason to be in full
force and effect, or Iron Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary or any Person acting on behalf of Iron
Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary shall deny or disaffirm in writing its obligations under its
Note Guarantee.


-----

In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect
to Iron Mountain, any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, all outstanding Notes will become
due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is
continuing (subject to the last paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Reports”),
the Trustee or Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may
declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately.

Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power with respect to the Notes. The
Trustee will be required to give notice to Holders within 90 days after a default of which the Trustee has
actual knowledge under the Indenture unless the default has been cured or waived as provided in the
Indenture. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if
it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to
the payment of principal of, premium on, if any, and interest on, the Notes.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of
Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or
powers under such Indenture at the request or direction of any Holders unless such Holders have offered the
Trustee indemnity or security reasonably acceptable to it against any cost, liability or expense incurred in
compliance with such request. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any,
or interest, if any, when due, no Holder shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or
otherwise, with respect to the Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other
remedy thereunder, unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of
Default;

(2) Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes shall
have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in
its own name as Trustee under the Indenture;

(3) such Holder or Holders offer and, if requested, provide to the Trustee security or indemnity
satisfactory to it against any costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request;

(4) the Trustee does not comply with such request within 60 days after its receipt of such request
and offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) during such 60-day period, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such written request.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by written
notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders of the Notes, rescind an acceleration or waive any
existing Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes and its consequences under the Indenture, if
the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree, except a continuing Default or Event of Default
in the payment of principal of, premium on, if any, or interest on, the Notes.

Iron Mountain is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the
Indenture, and Iron Mountain is required upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, to
deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Managers, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder or other equity holder of Iron
Mountain or any Restricted Subsidiary, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of Iron Mountain
or any Restricted Subsidiary under the Notes, the Note Guarantees or the Indenture or for any claim
based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder, by accepting a
Note and the Note Guarantees, waives and releases all such liability. This waiver and release are part of the


-----

consideration for issuance of the Notes and the Note Guarantees. Such waiver may not be effective to waive
liabilities under U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against
public policy.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

Iron Mountain may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with
respect to the Notes, or Legal Defeasance, except for:

(1) the rights of Holders of the outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal
of, premium, if any, and interest on such Notes when such payments are due;

(2) Iron Mountain’s obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary notes,
registration of notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen notes and the maintenance of an office or
agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and Iron Mountain’s
obligations in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, Iron Mountain may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations released
with respect to certain covenants applicable to the Notes, including the one described above under the
caption “—Certain covenants—Reports,” that are described in the Indenture, or Covenant Defeasance, and
thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default
with respect the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including non-payment,
bankruptcy, receivership and insolvency events) described under “—Events of default and remedies” will
no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(1) Iron Mountain must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of Holders
of the Notes, cash in U.S. Dollars for the Notes, non-callable Government Securities, or a combination
thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of
independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the outstanding
Notes on the stated maturity or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, of such
principal or installment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the outstanding Notes;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, Iron Mountain shall have delivered to the Trustee an opinion
of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that (i) Iron Mountain has received from,
or there has been published by, the IRS a ruling or (ii) since the date of the Indenture, there has been a
change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based
thereon such opinion of counsel shall confirm that, Holders and beneficial owners of the outstanding
Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such
Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, Iron Mountain shall have delivered to the Trustee an
opinion of counsel in the U.S. reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that Holders and
beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income
tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if
such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (other than a Default
or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit (and any similar
concurrent deposit relating to other Indebtedness), and the granting of Liens to secure such
borrowings) on the date of the deposit described in clause (1) above;


-----

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture and the
agreements governing any other Indebtedness being defeased, discharged or replaced) to which Iron
Mountain or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which Iron Mountain or any of its Subsidiaries is
bound;

(6) Iron Mountain shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate stating that the
deposit was not made by Iron Mountain with the intent of preferring Holders of Notes over any other
creditors of Iron Mountain with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors
of Iron Mountain or others; and

(7) Iron Mountain shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an opinion of
counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant
Defeasance have been complied with.

If Iron Mountain accomplished a Legal Defeasance, Holders of the Notes would have to rely solely on
the trust deposit for repayment on the Notes. A Holder could not look to Iron Mountain or a Subsidiary
Guarantor for repayment in the unlikely event of any shortfall. Conversely, the trust deposit would most likely
be protected from any claims of Iron Mountain’s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ lenders and other
creditors if they ever became bankrupt or insolvent. If Iron Mountain accomplished a Covenant Defeasance,
Holders of the Notes can still look to Iron Mountain and the Subsidiary Guarantors for repayment of the
Notes if a shortfall in the trust deposit occurred. If one of the remaining Events of Default occurs, for
example, a bankruptcy, and the Notes become immediately due and payable, there may be a shortfall.
Depending on the event causing the Event of Default, a Holder of the Notes may not be able to obtain
payment of the shortfall.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued thereunder,
when:

(1) either:

(a) all Notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that have
been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust and
thereafter repaid to Iron Mountain, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(b) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and
payable by reason of the delivery of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due and
payable within one year and Iron Mountain or any Subsidiary Guarantor has irrevocably deposited
or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of Holders
of such Notes, cash in U.S. Dollars, non-callable Government Securities, or a combination thereof,
in amounts as will be sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay
and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation
for principal of, premium on, if any, and interest on, the Notes to the date of maturity or redemption;

(2) in respect of clause (1)(b), no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
on the date of the deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of
funds to be applied to such deposit and any similar deposit relating to other Indebtedness and, in each
case, the granting of Liens to secure such borrowings) and the deposit will not result in a breach or
violation of, or constitute a default under, any other instrument to which Iron Mountain or any
Subsidiary Guarantor is a party or by which Iron Mountain or any Subsidiary Guarantor is bound
(other than with respect to the borrowing of funds to be applied concurrently to make the deposit
required to effect such satisfaction and discharge and any similar concurrent deposit relating to other
Indebtedness, and in each case the granting of Liens to secure such borrowings);

(3) Iron Mountain or any Subsidiary Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable
by it under the Indenture; and


-----

(4) Iron Mountain has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to
apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as
the case may be.

In addition, Iron Mountain must deliver an Officers’ Certificate and an opinion of counsel to the
Trustee stating that all conditions precedent to the satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

**Book-entry, Delivery and Form**

**_General_**

The Notes will be issued in the form of one or more fully registered global Notes in book entry form,
which will be deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC, and registered in the name of DTC’s nominee, Cede &
Co. Except as set forth below, the global Notes may not be transferred except as a whole by DTC to a nominee
of DTC or by a nominee of DTC to DTC or another nominee of DTC or by DTC or any such nominee
to a successor of DTC or a nominee of such successor.

So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner of a global Note, DTC or its nominee, as the
case may be, will be considered the sole holder of the Notes represented by such global Note for all purposes
under the Indenture and the beneficial owners of the Notes will be entitled only to those rights and
benefits afforded to them in accordance with DTC’s regular operating procedures. Upon specified written
instructions of a participant in DTC, DTC will have its nominee assist participants in the exercise of certain
holders’ rights, such as demand for acceleration of maturity or an instruction to the Trustee. Except as
provided below, owners of beneficial interests in a global Note will not be entitled to have Notes registered
in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of Notes in certificated form and will
not be considered the registered owners or holders thereof under the Indenture.

If (1) DTC is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as depository or if at any time DTC ceases to
be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and a successor depository is not appointed by Iron
Mountain within 90 days, (2) an Event of Default under the Indenture has occurred and is continuing and
the beneficial owners representing a majority in principal amount of the Notes advise DTC to cease acting as
depository for the Notes or (3) Iron Mountain, in its sole discretion, determines at any time that the Notes
shall no longer be represented by a global Note, Iron Mountain will issue individual Notes in certificated form
and like tenor and in the applicable principal amount in exchange for the Notes represented by the global
Note. In any such instance, an owner of a beneficial interest in a global Note will be entitled to physical
delivery of individual Notes in certificated form and like tenor, equal in principal amount to such beneficial
interest and to have the Notes in certificated form registered in its name. The Notes so issued in certificated
form will be issued in denominations of $2,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof and will be
issued in registered form only, without coupons.

The Indenture will also provide that, in connection with any proposed transfer involving certificated
Notes, the Holder that is the transferor of the Note and Iron Mountain, to the extent that the information
is reasonably available to Iron Mountain, shall use commercially reasonably efforts to provide the Trustee with
all information as is reasonably requested by the Trustee and necessary to allow the Trustee to comply with
any applicable tax reporting obligations, including without limitation any cost basis reporting obligations
under Section 6045 of the Code. The Trustee may rely on information provided to it and shall have no
responsibility to verify or ensure the accuracy of such information.

The following is based on information furnished by DTC:

DTC will act as securities depository for the Notes. The Notes will be issued as fully registered Notes
registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested
by an authorized representative of DTC.

DTC, the world’s largest securities depository, is a limited purpose trust company organized under the
New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a
member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York
Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of
the Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S.


-----

equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues and money market instruments from over 100 countries
that DTC’s direct participants deposit with DTC.

DTC also facilitates the post trade settlement among direct participants of sales and other securities
transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book entry transfers and pledges
between direct participants’accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates.
Direct participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies,
clearing corporations and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository
Trust & Clearing Corporation, or DTCC. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as
both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations
that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either directly or indirectly.
The DTC rules applicable to its participants are on file with the SEC. More information about DTC can
be found at www.dtcc.com.

Purchases of the Notes under the DTC system must be made by or through direct participants, which
will receive a credit for the Notes on DTC’s records. The beneficial interest of each actual purchaser of each
Note is in turn to be recorded on the direct and indirect participants’ records.

Beneficial owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial owners
are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic
statements of their holdings, from the direct or indirect participant through which the beneficial owner
entered into the transaction. Transfers of beneficial interests in the Notes are to be accomplished by entries
made on the books of direct and indirect participants acting on behalf of beneficial owners. Beneficial
owners will not receive certificates representing their beneficial interests in Notes, except in the event that
use of the book entry system for the Notes is discontinued. The laws of some states require that certain
persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities which they own. Such limits and such laws may
impair the ability of such persons to own, transfer or pledge beneficial interests in a global Note.

To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Notes deposited by direct participants with DTC will be registered
in the name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co. or such other name as may be requested by an
authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of Notes with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede
& Co. or such other nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of
the actual beneficial owners of the Notes; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the direct participants to
whose accounts the Notes will be credited, which may or may not be the beneficial owners. The direct and
indirect participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.

Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to direct participants, by direct participants
to indirect participants, and by direct participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners will be
governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in
effect from time to time. Beneficial owners of the Notes may wish to take certain steps to augment the
transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to the Notes, such as redemption, tenders
and defaults. For example, beneficial owners of the Notes may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding
the Notes for their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to beneficial owners. In the alternative,
beneficial owners may wish to provide their names and addresses to the registrar of the Notes and request
that copies of the notices be provided to them directly. Any such request may or may not be successful.

Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the
Notes unless authorized by a direct participant in accordance with DTC’s procedures. Under its usual
procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to Iron Mountain as soon as possible after the record date. The
Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.’s consenting or voting rights to those direct participants to whose accounts
the Notes are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy).

Iron Mountain will pay principal of and interest, premium, if any, and the applicable Make-Whole
Amount, if any, on the Notes in same day funds to the Trustee and from such Trustee or any paying agent
for delivery to DTC, or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC.
DTC’s practice is to credit direct participants’ accounts on the applicable payment date in accordance
with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding
detail information. Payments by participants to beneficial owners will be governed by standing instructions


-----

and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or
registered in “street name,” and will be the responsibility of these participants and not of Iron Mountain, the
Trustee, DTC or any other party, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements that may be in effect
from time to time. Payment of principal, interest, premium, if any, and the applicable Make-Whole Amount,
if any, to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of
DTC, is the responsibility of Iron Mountain or the Trustee, disbursement of such payments to direct
participants is the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the beneficial owners is the
responsibility of the direct or indirect participants.

Iron Mountain will send any redemption notices to DTC. If less than all of the Notes are being
redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each direct participant in
such issue to be redeemed.

DTC may discontinue providing its services as depository for the Notes at any time by giving Iron
Mountain reasonable notice. Under such circumstances, if a successor securities depository is not obtained,
Iron Mountain will print and deliver certificated Notes. Iron Mountain may decide to discontinue use of
the system of book entry transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depository). In that event, Iron
Mountain will print and deliver certificated Notes.

Iron Mountain, the initial purchasers and the Trustee will have no responsibility or liability for any
aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of the beneficial interests in a global Note,
or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial interests.

The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s system has been obtained from sources
that Iron Mountain believes to be reliable, but it takes no responsibility for its accuracy.

**Same-day Settlement and Payment**

The initial purchasers will make settlement for the Notes in immediately available funds. Iron Mountain
will make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Notes in immediately available funds.

The Notes will trade in DTC’s same-day funds settlement system until maturity or until the Notes are
issued in certificated form, and secondary market trading activity in the Notes will therefore be required by
DTC to settle in immediately available funds. Iron Mountain expects that secondary trading in the
certificated Notes, if any, will also be settled in immediately available funds. No assurance can be given as to
the effect, if any, of settlement in immediately available funds on trading activity in the Notes.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next three succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture and the Notes may be
amended or supplemented with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for
such Notes), and any existing default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Notes may
be waived with the consent of Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for such Notes).

Without the consent of each Holder of the Notes affected, an amendment or waiver may not (with
respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder):

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment,
supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Notes or alter any of the
provisions with respect to the redemption of any Note in a manner adverse to the Holder of such
Note;

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note;

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or
interest on any Note (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by Holders of at least a majority


-----

in aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding and a waiver of the payment default that
resulted from such acceleration);

(5) make any Note payable in a currency other than that stated in such Note;

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or
the legal rights of Holders to receive payments of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the
Notes;

(7) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment required by any
of the covenants described above under the caption “—Repurchase at the option of Holders”);

(8) except pursuant to the Indenture, release any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under
its Note Guarantee, or change any Note Guarantee in any manner that would materially adversely affect
Holders of the Notes; or

(9) make any change in the foregoing amendment and waiver provisions.

It will not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under the Indenture to approve the particular
form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it will be sufficient if such consent approves the substance
thereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, Iron Mountain and the Trustee
may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Notes to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, to
provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided that the uncertificated
Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code), to provide for the
assumption of Iron Mountain’s or a Guarantor’s obligations to Holders in the case of a merger or
consolidation, to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to Holders (including
providing for additional Note Guarantees) or that does not adversely affect the legal rights of any such
Holder under the Indenture, to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the
limitations set forth in the Indenture, or to conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes or the Note
Guarantees to any provision of this “Description of the notes” to the extent that such provision in this
“Description of the notes”was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Notes
or the Note Guarantees, which intent may be evidenced by an Officers’ Certificate delivered to the Trustee
to that effect.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of any of the covenants described under
“—Certain covenants,” or action taken in compliance with the covenants in effect at the time of such
action, shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of any Holders to receive payment of principal of or
premium, if any, or interest on the Notes or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with
respect to such Holder’s Notes.

Notes are not considered outstanding, and therefore Holders thereof are not eligible to vote, if Iron
Mountain has deposited or set aside in trust for such Holders money for their payment or redemption or if
Iron Mountain or one of its Affiliates owns them. Holders are also not eligible to vote if they have been fully

otherwise deal with Iron Mountain or any of its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not
Trustee. However, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign.

Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the right to direct
the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee
with respect to the Notes, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture will provide that in case an Event
of Default shall occur (which shall not be cured), the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to
use the degree of care of a prudent man in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the


-----

Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request
of any Holder, unless such Holder shall have offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to
it against any loss, liability or expense.

(2) the then outstanding principal amount of such Indebtedness.

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition,
ownership and disposition of Notes purchased in this offering at the “issue price,” which we assume will be
the price indicated on the cover of this offering memorandum. This discussion is based on current provisions
of the Code, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S.
Department of the Treasury, or the Treasury Regulations, rulings, pronouncements, judicial decisions and
administrative interpretations of the IRS, all of which are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis,
at any time by legislative, judicial or administrative action. If you are considering the purchase of the
Notes, you should consult an independent tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S.
income and other tax consequences applicable in your particular circumstances.

The following discussion does not purport to be a complete analysis of all the potential U.S. federal
income tax consequences relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes. This discussion
does not address specific tax consequences that may be relevant to particular investors in light of their
individual circumstances (including, for example, entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income
tax purposes or partners or members therein, banks or other financial institutions, broker-dealers, insurance
companies, regulated investment companies, REITs, tax-exempt entities, common trust funds, foreign
governments or international organizations, qualified foreign pension funds, controlled foreign corporations,
passive foreign investment companies, certain U.S. expatriates or other foreign persons (except for the
discussion of Non-U.S. holders), U.S. persons whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar, persons
subject to special accounting rules under Section 451(b) of the Code, dealers in securities or currencies,
persons subject to the alternative minimum tax and persons in special situations, such as those who hold Notes
as part of a straddle, hedge, synthetic security, conversion transaction or other integrated investment
comprising Notes and one or more other investments). This discussion is limited to Notes acquired pursuant
to this offering and does not address the tax consequences that may be relevant to a person that acquires
the Notes in any other transaction. Further, this discussion does not address the tax consequences to investors
that also hold our outstanding indebtedness that will be repaid from the proceeds of this offering. References
to the Notes in this discussion pertain to the Initial Notes and not to any Additional Notes. Unless
otherwise stated, this discussion is limited to the U.S. federal income tax consequences to beneficial owners
of Notes that hold such Notes as capital assets (generally, property held for investment) for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. In addition, this discussion does not describe the Medicare tax on certain investment income
or any tax consequences arising under U.S. federal gift, estate or other federal tax laws or under the tax laws
of any state, local or non-U.S. jurisdiction.

**YOU SHOULD CONSULT AN INDEPENDENT TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE U.S.**
**FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU OF ACQUIRING, OWNING AND DISPOSING**
**OF THE NOTES, AS WELL AS THE APPLICATION OF STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME**
**AND OTHER TAX LAWS.**

As used herein, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is for U.S. federal income tax
purposes:

   - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes;

   - a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created
or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;

   - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

   - a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the
administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial
decisions of the trust or (ii) it has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to
be treated as a U.S. person.

If any entity classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax
treatment of an owner of such entity generally will depend on the status of the owner and the activities of
the entity. Such entities acquiring the Notes, and owners in such entities, should consult an independent tax
advisor as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the
Notes applicable to them.


-----

For purposes of this discussion, “Non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that is for U.S.
federal income tax purposes (i) a foreign corporation, (ii) a non-resident alien individual, or (iii) a foreign
estate or trust that, in each case, is not subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis.

U.S. holders that use an accrual method of accounting for tax purposes may be required to accrue
income earlier than would be the case under the general tax rules described below. If you use an accrual
method of accounting, you should consult with your tax advisor regarding the potential application of these
rules to your particular situation.

**Taxation of Our Company**

For a discussion of certain material United States federal income tax considerations relating to our
qualification and taxation as a REIT, please see the discussion under the heading “Material United States
Federal Income Tax Considerations” in Exhibit 99.1 to our second Current Report on Form 8-K filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 13, 2020, which is incorporated by reference in this
offering memorandum.

**U.S. Holders**

**_Certain Additional Payments_**

There are circumstances in which we might be required to make payments on a Note in excess of stated
interest and the principal amount of the Notes that would increase the yield of the Note, for instance as
described under “Description of the notes—Optional redemption” and “—Repurchase at the option of
Holders—Change of control.” In addition, if we fail to file reports with the SEC in a timely manner, we may
be required to pay you liquidated damages calculated in a manner similar to additional interest accrued
over a limited period of time. We intend to take the position that the possibility of such payments does not
result in the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury
Regulations. This position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS were to take a contrary position, a U.S.
holder may be required to accrue interest income based on a “comparable yield” (as defined in the Treasury
Regulations) determined at the time of issuance of the Notes, with adjustments to such accruals when any
contingent payments are made that differ from the payments projected to be made based on the comparable
yield. In addition, any income on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Notes
would be treated as ordinary interest income rather than as capital gain. You should consult your tax advisor
regarding the tax consequences if the Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments. The
remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes are not treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

**_Stated Interest_**

Stated interest on the Notes will be includable in the income of a U.S. holder as ordinary interest
income at the time such holder receives or accrues such amounts, in accordance with its regular method of
tax accounting.

It is expected, and this discussion assumes, that the Notes will not be issued with more than a de
minimis amount of original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If, however, the Notes’
principal amount exceeds the issue price by more than a de minimis amount, as determined under applicable
Treasury Regulations, a U.S. holder will be required to include such excess of principal amount over issue
price in income as original issue discount, as it accrues, in accordance with a constant yield method based on
a compounding of interest, before the receipt of cash payments attributable to this income.

**_Sale, Exchanges or Disposition_**

Upon the sale, exchange, redemption or other disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder will generally
recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized and the holder’s
adjusted tax basis in the Note at the time of such disposition. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis for U.S.
federal income tax purposes will generally be its cost for the Note. Such gain or loss will be long-term capital
gain or loss if the U.S. holder’s holding period with respect to the Note disposed of is more than one year.
To the extent that amounts received include accrued but unpaid stated interest, such interest will not be taken


-----

into account in determining gain or loss, but will instead be subject to tax as ordinary interest income if the
U.S. holder has not yet included such stated interest in income. Long-term capital gains recognized by
noncorporate U.S. holders (including individuals) are currently eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

A U.S. holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding when such U.S. holder
receives interest and principal payments on the Notes or proceeds upon the sale or other disposition of such
Notes (including a redemption or retirement of the Notes). Certain U.S. holders (including, among others,
corporations) are generally not subject to certain information reporting or backup withholding. A U.S. holder
will be subject to backup withholding if such holder is not otherwise exempt and fails to provide its
taxpayer identification number and to comply with certain certification procedures.

You should consult your tax advisor regarding your qualification for an exemption from backup
withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption, if applicable. Backup withholding is not
an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a U.S. holder
generally will be allowed as a credit against the U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability or may be
refunded, provided the required information is furnished in a timely manner to the IRS.

**Non-U.S. Holders**

**_Taxation of Interest_**

Subject to the backup withholding rules and the discussion under “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance
Act”below, payments of interest on a Note to any Non-U.S. holder will generally not be subject to U.S. federal
income or withholding tax, if:

   - the Non-U.S. holder is not an actual or constructive (including through certain ownership attribution
rules) owner of 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all of our voting stock;

   - the Non-U.S. holder is not a “controlled foreign corporation” related, directly or indirectly, to us;

   - the Non-U.S. holder is not a bank that received such interest on an extension of credit made
pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business;

  - either (i) the Non-U.S. holder certifies on a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or Form
W-8BEN-E, under penalties of perjury, that it is not a United States person or (ii) the Non-U.S.
holder holds its note directly through a “qualified intermediary” (within the meaning of applicable
Treasury Regulations) and certain conditions are satisfied; and

   - such interest is not effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-U.S. holder of a trade or
business within the United States, as described below.

A Non-U.S. holder that does not qualify for exemption from withholding under the rules described in
the preceding paragraph will generally be subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax at the rate of
30%, or a lower treaty rate, if applicable, on payments of interest on the Notes unless the interest is effectively
connected with the conduct by the Non-U.S. holder of a trade or business within the United States (as
described below).

If the interest on a Note is effectively connected with the conduct by a Non-U.S. holder of a trade or
business within the United States (and, if an applicable income tax treaty so requires, is attributable to a
permanent establishment in the United States), such income will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a
net basis at the rates generally applicable to U.S. persons. If the Non-U.S. holder is a corporation for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, the “dividend equivalent amount” attributable to such income also may be
subject to a 30% branch profits tax (or lower treaty rate, if applicable). If income is subject to U.S. federal
income tax on a net basis in accordance with the rules described above, such income will not be subject to U.S.
withholding tax so long as the holder provides us, or the person otherwise required to withhold U.S.
federal income tax, with the appropriate certification, generally on IRS Form W-8ECI.


-----

In order to claim an income tax treaty benefit, the Non-U.S. holder must provide a properly executed
Form W-8BEN-E, Form W-8BEN or the appropriate successor form (and any applicable documentary
evidence or attachments thereto) to its withholding agent. These forms must be periodically updated.

You should consult your tax advisor regarding any applicable income tax treaties, which may provide for
a lower rate of withholding tax, an exemption from or reduction of branch profits tax, or other rules different
from those described above.

**_Sale, Exchange or Disposition_**

Subject to the backup withholding rules and the discussion under “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance
Act” below, any gain realized by a Non-U.S. holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of
a Note will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax unless;

(1) such gain is effectively connected with the conduct by such Non-U.S. holder of a trade or business
within the United States (and, if an applicable income tax treaty so requires, is attributable to a
permanent establishment in the United States); or

(2) in the case of an individual, such individual is present in the United States for 183 days or more
during the taxable year in which gain is realized and certain other conditions are met.

Proceeds from the disposition of a Note that are attributable to accrued but unpaid interest will be
treated as interest and will generally be treated as subject to, or exempt from, U.S. federal income and
withholding tax to the same extent as described above with respect to interest paid on a Note.

Gain that is effectively connected with the conduct by a Non-U.S. holder of a trade or business in the
United States (and, if an applicable income tax treaty so requires, is attributable to a permanent establishment
in the United States) will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis at the rates generally
applicable to U.S. persons. In addition, if such Non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, such holder may
also be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as an applicable treaty may provide)
on its effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year, subject to certain adjustments.

If the exception under (2) above applies, the Non-U.S. holder will generally be subject to U.S. federal
income tax at a rate of 30% (or at a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on the amount by
which capital gains allocable to U.S. sources (including gains from the sale, exchange, retirement or other
disposition of the Notes) exceed capital losses allocable to U.S. sources.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder
(commonly referred to as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act or FATCA) generally impose
withholding at a rate of 30% in certain circumstances on U.S.-source interest payable on the Notes held by
or through certain financial institutions (including investment funds), unless such institution enters into, and
complies with, an agreement with the IRS to report, on an annual basis, information with respect to
certain interests in, and accounts maintained by, the institution that are owned by certain U.S. persons or by
certain non-U.S. entities that are wholly or partially owned by U.S. persons and to withhold on certain
payments. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country
may modify these requirements. Similarly, interest payable on the Notes held by an investor that is a
non-financial non-U.S. entity that does not qualify under certain exemptions generally will be subject to
withholding at a rate of 30%, unless such entity either (y) certifies that such entity does not have any
“substantial United States owners” or (z) provides certain information regarding the entity’s “substantial
United States owners,” which we will in turn provide to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

You should consult your tax advisor regarding the possible implications of these rules on an investment
in the Notes.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

Generally, the amounts of interest paid to a Non-U.S. holder and the amount of tax, if any, withheld
with respect to such amounts and certain other information must be reported to the IRS. Such information


-----

may also be provided to the authorities of the country in which a Non-U.S. holder resides pursuant to the
terms of an applicable income tax treaty.

Proceeds from the sale or other taxable disposition of the Notes will also generally be subject to
information reporting and such proceeds and payments of interest made on the Notes will generally be
subject to United States federal backup withholding at the rate then in effect if the recipient of such payment
fails to comply with applicable United States information reporting or certification requirements. Backup
withholding is not an additional tax. Any amount withheld under the backup withholding rules is allowable
as a credit against the holder’s United States federal income tax, provided that the required information is
furnished timely to the IRS.

THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE A DETAILED DISCUSSION
OF ALL THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS THAT MAY BE RELEVANT TO
A HOLDER OF THE NOTES IN THEIR SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES. IF YOU ARE
CONSIDERING THE PURCHASE OF THE NOTES, YOU ARE URGED TO CONSULT WITH
YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE TAX IMPLICATIONS OF ACQUIRING,
HOLDING, AND DISPOSING OF THE NOTES IN YOUR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.


-----

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

This disclosure was written in connection with the promotion and marketing of the Notes by the Issuer
and the initial purchasers, and it cannot be used by any holder for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may
be asserted against the holder under the Code. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their
own tax advisors with respect to the application of the U.S. federal income tax laws to their particular
situations.

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of the
Notes by employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the United States Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements
that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, and entities whose underlying assets are considered to
include “plan assets” of such employee benefit plans, plans, accounts or arrangements (within the meaning
of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA and regulations promulgated under
ERISA by the U.S. Department of Labor) (each, an “ERISA Plan”). Employee benefit plans that are
governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33)
of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) are not subject to the
requirements of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code; however, such plans may be subject to non-U.S.,
federal, state, or local laws or regulations that are substantially similar to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code (“Similar Laws”) or which otherwise affect their ability to invest in the Notes. Any fiduciary of
such a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan considering an investment in the Notes (together with
ERISA Plans, “Plans”) should determine the need for, and, if necessary, the availability of, any exemptive
relief under such laws or regulations.

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of an ERISA Plan and
prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested
parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the
administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA
Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation with respect to the assets of such an
ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a Plan fiduciary
should consult with its counsel in order to determine the suitability of the Notes for such Plan, including
whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan and
the need for, and the availability, if necessary, of any exemptive relief under any such laws or regulations.
In addition, a fiduciary of a Plan should consult with its counsel in order to determine if the investment
satisfies the fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification,
delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable
Similar Laws.

Each ERISA Plan should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the Subsidiary Guarantors, the
initial purchasers and the Trustee and their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction Parties”) is
acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any ERISA Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes.
The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or advice based on any
particular investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or
hold the Notes. All communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with
respect to the Notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of
the Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific
purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the Notes must be made solely by each prospective ERISA
Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest”, within the meaning


-----

of ERISA, or “disqualified persons”, within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless a statutory or
administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. Such “prohibited transactions” include, without
limitation, (1) a direct or indirect extension of credit to a party in interest or to a disqualified person, (2) the
sale or exchange of any property between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person,
or (3) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or a disqualified person, of any plan
assets.

A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be
subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary
of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties
and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition, holding and/or disposition of Notes by an ERISA
Plan with respect to which any Transaction Party is considered a party in interest or disqualified person
may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or
Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable
statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, certain exemptions from the
prohibited transaction rules could be applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes by an ERISA
Plan, depending on the type and circumstances of the fiduciary making the decision to acquire such Notes
and the relationship of the party in interest or disqualified person to the ERISA Plan. Included among these
exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code for certain transactions
between an ERISA Plan and non-fiduciary service providers to the ERISA Plan. In addition, the United
States Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may
apply to the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These class exemptions (as may be amended from time to
time) include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 (respecting transactions effected by independent “qualified
professional asset managers”), PTCE 90-1 (respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE
91-38 (respecting bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60 (respecting life insurance company
general accounts) and PTCE 96-23 (respecting transactions directed by in-house asset managers).

Each of these PTCEs contains conditions and limitations on its application. Thus, the fiduciaries of an
ERISA Plan that is considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in reliance of any of these, or any other,
PTCEs should carefully review the conditions and limitations of the PTCE and consult with their counsel
to confirm that it is applicable. There can be no, and we do not provide any, assurance that any PTCE or any
other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the notes.

Similar Laws governing the investment and management of the assets of governmental plans, certain
church plans and non-U.S. plans which are not subject to ERISA and the Code may contain fiduciary
responsibility and prohibited transaction requirements similar to those under Title I of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code. Accordingly, fiduciaries of such Plans, in consultation with their counsel, should
consider the impact of Similar Laws on investments in the Notes and the considerations discussed above,
to the extent applicable.

Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan
assets” of any Plan, unless such acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition (i) are entitled to exemption
relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code and are otherwise permissible
under all applicable Similar Laws or (ii) will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA
and the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

The foregoing discussion is necessarily general in nature, is not intended to be all-inclusive, and should
not be construed as legal advice or a legal opinion. Further, no assurance can be given that future legislation,
administrative rulings, court decisions or regulatory action will not modify the conclusions set forth in this
discussion. Any such changes may be retroactive and thereby apply to transactions entered into prior to the
date of their enactment or release. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be
imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that
fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing the Notes (and holding the Notes) on behalf of, or with
the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA,
Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such transactions and whether an exemption would be
applicable.


-----

**Representation**

Accordingly, by acceptance of a Note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee will be deemed to
have represented and agreed that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to
acquire and hold the Notes or an interest therein constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) (a) the acquisition,
holding and disposition by such purchaser or transferee of the Notes or an interest therein will not
constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code or similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws, and (b) none of the Transaction Parties
has acted as the Plan’s fiduciary, or has been relied upon for any advice, with respect to the Plan’s decision
to acquire a Note and none of the Transaction Parties will at any time be relied upon as the Plan’s fiduciary
with respect to any decision to acquire, continue to hold or transfer a Note.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the initial purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their
counsel. The initial purchasers reserve the right to reject any order in whole or in part.

The Purchase Agreement provides that Iron Mountain and the Subsidiary Guarantors will indemnify
the several initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will
contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof.

In connection with the offering of the Notes, the initial purchasers may engage in overallotment,
stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the
offering size, which creates a short position for the initial purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to
purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the
Notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution
has been completed in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering
transactions may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes or
cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If
the initial purchasers engage in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, they may discontinue them at
any time.

Certain of the initial purchasers have advised Iron Mountain that they presently intend to make a
market in the Notes as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. The initial purchasers are not obliged,
however, to make a market in the Notes and any such market-making may be discontinued at any time at the
sole discretion of the initial purchasers. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or
trading markets for, the Notes. Please see “Risk factors—Risks related to our indebtedness—You may find
it difficult to sell your Notes because no public trading market for the Notes currently exists and securities
laws will restrict your ability to transfer the Notes.”

The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold within the
U.S. or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities
Act) except to (i) persons reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional buyers”in reliance on the exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A thereunder and (ii) persons
in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. In addition, until 40 days following the issue date of the
Notes, an offer or sale of the Notes initially sold in reliance on Regulation S by a dealer (whether or not
participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer
makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the
Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S under the
Securities Act. Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations
and agreements as described under “Transfer restrictions.”

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction by Iron Mountain or any initial purchaser that would
permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering
memorandum or any other material relating to Iron Mountain or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action
for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and
neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the
Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with
any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not
constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or
solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes are advised
to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the Notes, the
distribution of this offering memorandum and resale of the Notes. Please see “Notice to investors.”

The Notes will initially be offered at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After the initial offering
of the Notes, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the
initial purchasers without notice.

The initial purchasers and their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in investment
banking and/or commercial banking transactions with, and may perform services for, Iron Mountain and
its affiliates in the ordinary course of business, for which they may receive customary fees and expenses.
Additionally, some of the initial purchasers (or affiliates thereof) may be holders of the Existing CAD Notes,
the Existing Euro Notes and/or the Existing USD 2026 Notes at the time such notes are redeemed and, as
such, would receive a portion of the net proceeds of this offering. Iron Mountain has also entered into a
distribution agreement with certain of the initial purchasers and certain other investment banks, as sales
agents, pursuant to which it may issue and sell shares of its common stock from time to time.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the initial purchasers and their affiliates
may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related
derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the
accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or
instruments of ours or our affiliates. If any of the initial purchasers or their affiliates have a lending
relationship with us, certain of those initial purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, certain of those
initial purchasers or their affiliates are likely to hedge and certain other of those initial purchasers or their
affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies.
Typically, these initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions
which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our
securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions
could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The initial purchasers and their
affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views
in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they
acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the closing
date specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which is the business day following
the date of this offering memorandum (such settlement cycle being referred to as “T+ ”). Under
Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two
business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish


-----

to trade the Notes before the second business day prior to the closing date specified on the cover page of
this offering memorandum will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+,
to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement.
Purchasers who wish to trade the Notes prior to their date of delivery hereunder should consult their own
advisors.

**Selling Restrictions**

**_Prohibition of Sales to Retail Investors in the European Economic Area and United Kingdom_**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or

investors in the EEA or in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the UK may be unlawful under the PRIIPS
Regulation. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any
Member State of the EEA or in the UK will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus
Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This offering memorandum
is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

persons”). This offering memorandum and its contents are confidential and should not be distributed,
published or reproduced (in whole or in part) or disclosed by recipients to any other persons in the UK.
Any invitation, offer or agreement to purchase or otherwise acquire the Notes in the UK will be engaged in
only with relevant persons. Any person in the UK that is not a relevant person should not act or rely on
this offering memorandum or any of its contents.

Any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”)) in connection with the issue of the Notes will be
communicated or caused to be communicated and will only be communicated or caused to be communicated
in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply. All applicable provisions of the
FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the UK
have been, and will be, complied with.
