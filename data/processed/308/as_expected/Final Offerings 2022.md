transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission and consequently
neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person who controls them nor any director, officer, employee nor agent of them or

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors—The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold, or otherwise**
made available to and should not be offered, sold, or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European
Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as
defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the
meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently, no key information
document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling
the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs
Regulation.

**Prohibition of Sales to United Kingdom Retail Investors – The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or**
otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold, or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United
Kingdom (“UK”). For these purposes, a “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as
defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA;
or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA
to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point
(8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, as amended, as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.
Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014, as amended, as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

**MiFID II Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect
of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional
clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (for the purposes
of this provision, a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a
distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by
either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**UK Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect
of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in
the UK Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”) and professional
clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (“UK MiFIR”);
and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any
person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the
manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and
Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own
target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

This document does not constitute or form part of any offer or invitation to sell these securities or any solicitation
of any offer to purchase these securities in any jurisdiction where such offer or sale is not permitted.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS IN LUXEMBOURG**

This Offering Memorandum has not been approved by and will not be submitted for approval to the Luxembourg
financial sector supervisory authority (Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier _or “CSSF”), or a competent_
authority of another Member State of the EEA for notification to the CSSF for purposes of a public offering or sale in
Luxembourg. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold to the public in Luxembourg, directly or indirectly, and
neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering memorandum, form of application, advertisement or other
material related to such notes may be distributed, or otherwise be made available in or from, or published in, Luxembourg
except in circumstances where the offer benefits from an exemption to or constitutes a transaction not subject to the
requirement to publish a prospectus, in accordance with the Prospectus Regulation and the Luxembourg law of July 16,
2019, on prospectuses for securities.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM**

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in the United Kingdom (“UK”)
will be made pursuant to an exemption from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes under
Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA and section 85 of the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000 (as amended, the “FSMA”).

**Prohibition of Sales to United Kingdom Retail Investors – The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold, or**
otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold, or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK.
For these purposes, a “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of
Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal)
Act 2018 (as amended, the “EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules
or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014, as amended, as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No
1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling
the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or
selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs
Regulation.

**UK Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market – Solely for the purposes**
of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the
conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the UK Financial Conduct
Authority (“FCA”) Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”) and professional clients, as defined in
Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels
for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently
offering, selling or recommending the Notes (for the purposes of this provision, a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product
Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for
undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’
target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

This Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in matters
relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the UK Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial
Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the “Financial Promotion Order”), (ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a)
through (d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations, etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are
outside the United Kingdom, or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity
(within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) in connection with the offering or sale of any Notes may otherwise
lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant
persons”). This Offering Memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons
who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this Offering Memorandum relates is
available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons.

Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance USA, a co-issuer of the Notes, is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Ardagh
Metal Packaging S.A., incorporated in Delaware on February 18, 2021.

**The Parent Guarantor**

The Parent Guarantor was incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg on January 20, 2021.

**Financial Information**

This Offering Memorandum includes or incorporates by reference:

  - the audited consolidated financial statements of the AMPSA Group as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, prepared in accordance with IFRS (as defined
below) (the “Audited Financial Statements”); and

  - the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of the AMPSA Group as of March 31, 2022 and for the
three months ended March 31, 2022, and March 31, 2021, prepared in accordance with IFRS (the “Unaudited
Interim Consolidated Financial Statements”).

This Offering Memorandum also includes the unaudited consolidated financial information for the twelve months
ended March 31, 2022 for the AMPSA Group, which has been derived by performing the mathematical exercise of
aggregating the relevant results for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the three months ended March 31, 2022 and
subtracting the results for the three months ended March 31, 2021. These results are for illustrative purposes only and have
not been subject to audit or review.

The Audited Financial Statements and the Unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements included or
incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum have been prepared in accordance with IFRS in effect as of
December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022 respectively.

For the three months from January 1, 2021 to April 1, 2021 (the date of transfer of the AMP Business to AMPSA) and
as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (presented as comparative financial information), consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on a carve-out basis from the consolidated financial statements of Ardagh Group
S.A. to represent the financial position and performance of the AMP Business as if it had existed on a stand-alone basis.
For a complete description of the accounting principles followed in preparing the financial statements, please see Note 3
“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies–Basis of preparation” to the Audited Financial Statements incorporated by
reference in this Offering Memorandum. For the period from April 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021, consolidated
financial statements have been prepared for the AMPSA Group as a stand-alone business.

In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own examination of the AMPSA Group, the terms of
the offering of the Notes and the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum. You should consult your
own professional advisers for an understanding of the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP and how those differences
could affect the financial information contained in and incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting
estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying accounting policies. The areas
involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the
consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in the Audited Financial Statements.

The Audited Financial Statements have been prepared based on a calendar year and are presented in U.S. dollars
rounded to the nearest million. Therefore, discrepancies in the tables between totals and the sums of the amounts listed
may occur due to such rounding.

Unless stated otherwise, debt balances are presented before deducting deferred financing costs.


-----

**Non-IFRS and Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

We present in this Offering Memorandum Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, net debt, working
capital and net interest expense and related ratios of AMPSA, which are supplemental measures of AMPSA’s performance
that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS.

We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as profit / (loss) before income tax/ (credit), net finance expense, depreciation
and amortization and exceptional operating items, and “Adjusted EBITDA margin” as Adjusted EBITDA divided by
revenue.

Net interest expense, working capital and net debt have the meaning set out in footnotes 2, 6 and 7 respectively
of “Summary Consolidated Financial & Other Data of Ardagh Metal Packaging S.A.”

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, net debt, working capital and net interest expense and related
ratios should not be considered in isolation and are not measures of our financial performance under IFRS or U.S. GAAP
and are not measures of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered an alternative to profit/(loss) as
indicators of operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. In addition,
such measures, as we define them, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.

**Industry and Market Data**

Given the specialized nature of the metal packaging markets in which we operate, there does not exist a relevant
and reliable third-party source of much of the relevant market information presented in or incorporated by reference in this
Offering Memorandum. Therefore, estimates provided regarding these markets as set forth in this Offering Memorandum,
as well as estimated market shares of us or our competitors, are largely based on our knowledge of these markets, developed
primarily from analysis of public information, third-party reports to the extent available, competitors’ public
announcements and regulatory filings and information gathered in the course of acquisitions. The data relating to market
sizes, market share and market position are based on the most recent data available. This information has not been
confirmed by an independent organization, nor can there be assurance that third parties would arrive at the same results
were they to employ different methods for gathering, analyzing and calculating such data. Breakdowns of market shares
were established on the basis of our consolidated revenues and these data. Market positions and percentage shares are those
that we believe it holds in terms of revenues. They are based on industry market sectors on which our group business is
arranged.

Any third-party information described above and included in or incorporated by reference in this Offering
Memorandum has been accurately reproduced and, as far as we are aware, and are able to ascertain from the information
published by such third parties, the reproduced information is accurate and no facts have been omitted which would render
such information inaccurate or misleading. Market share data is subject to change, however, and such third-party
information has been prepared for statistical and other informational purposes, which is limited by the availability and
reliability of raw data, the voluntary nature of the data gathering process and other limitations and uncertainties inherent in
any statistical survey of market share.

Memorandum (including information incorporated by reference herein) and include statements regarding our intentions,
beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity,
prospects, growth, strategies, and the industry in which we operate.

We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate, may differ
materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum
(including information incorporated by reference herein). In addition, even if our results of operations, financial condition
and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate are consistent with the forward-looking statements
contained in this Offering Memorandum (including information incorporated by reference herein), those results or
developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors
because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Forward-looking
statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The development of the industry in which we operate may differ materially from (and be more negative than) those made
in, or suggested by, the forward-looking statements contained (or incorporated by reference) in this Offering Memorandum.

These statements are based on management’s current views and assumptions and involve known and unknown
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance, or events to differ materially from those anticipated by
such statements. Factors that could cause such differences in actual results include:

- changes in applicable laws or regulations;

- the risk that Ardagh Metal Packaging will need to raise additional capital to execute its current and future business
plan, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all;

- the risk that Ardagh Metal Packaging experiences difficulties in managing its growth and expanding operations;

- the risk of global and regional economic downturns;

- competition from other metal beverage packaging producers and manufacturers of alternative forms of packaging;

- the risk of climate and water conditions;

- foreign currency, interest rate, exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations;

- various environmental requirements;

- the incurrence of debt and ability to generate cash to comply with financial covenants;

- Ardagh Metal Packaging’s ability to execute a significant multi-year business growth investment program (the
“Business Growth Investment Program”);


-----

- Ardagh Metal Packaging’s ability to achieve expected operating efficiencies, cost savings and other synergies;

- the availability and cost of raw materials;

- costs and future funding obligations associated with post-retirement and post-employment obligations;

- operating hazards, supply chain interruptions or unanticipated interruptions at Ardagh Metal Packaging’s
manufacturing facilities, including due to virus and disease outbreaks, labor strikes or work stoppages;

- claims of injury or illness from materials used at Ardagh Metal Packaging’s productions sites or in its products;

- regulation of materials used in packaging and consumer preferences for alternative forms of packaging;

- retention of executive and senior management;

- the possibility that Ardagh Metal Packaging may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or
competitive factors;

- reliance on third party software and services to be provided by Ardagh Group;

- risk of counterparties terminating servicing rights and contracts; and

- other risks and uncertainties described in this Offering Memorandum, including those under “Risk Factors.”

We undertake no obligations to update publicly or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to
reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Offering Memorandum or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated
events, other than as required by law.

The foregoing factors and others described under “Risk Factors” or incorporated by reference herein should not
be construed as exhaustive. There are other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the
forward-looking statements contained (or incorporated by reference) in this Offering Memorandum. Moreover, new risks
emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risks. We cannot assess the impact of all risks on
our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from
those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance

**Overview**

For information relation to the Group and its business, please refer to the information from the Form 20-F filed
by Ardagh Metal Packaging S.A. with the SEC on March 4, 2022 incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum.
See “Incorporation of Certain Information by Reference.”

**Recent Developments**

_Russia-Ukraine Conflict_

The recent Russia-Ukraine conflict which commenced in February 2022 has not to date resulted in any disruptions
to our operations. We have no operations or employees in Russia or Ukraine, while historic sales into the region have been
de minimis. In addition, we do not currently source any raw materials from Russia or Ukraine, nor do we have any current
plans or intentions to do so in the future. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the conflict has exacerbated inflationary cost
pressures for certain commodity inputs, notably energy, and has increased global supply chain pressures. Cost recovery
initiatives are under way to mitigate elevated input costs arising from the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

_Other_

On April 26, 2022, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per common share, to be
paid on June 28, 2022 to shareholders of record on June 14, 2022. A second quarter dividend of $0.10 per common share
has been declared and will be paid on June 28, 2022 to shareholders of record on June 14, 2022. We intend to pay a regular
quarterly dividend of $0.10 per common share. This $0.40 dividend per common share represents a full year cash dividend
of approximately $240 million.

On June 1, 2022, we announced a stock buyback authorization of up to $200 million of our shares through
December 31, 2023. The Ardagh Group does not intend to participate in this stock buyback program.

On June 1, 2022, we announced that we intend to increase our Global Asset-Based Loan Facility from $325
million to approximately $400 million.

We anticipate that our cash requirements for business growth initiative capital expenditure in 2022 will decrease
from $1 billion to approximately $0.7 billion through increased use of leasing and re-phasing of certain project spending
while maintaining the planned production footprint.

**Offering of Preferred Shares**

For purposes of amending our articles of association to permit the issuance of preferred shares, our shareholders
of record on June 13, 2022 will be invited to an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders to be held on July 8, 2022.
Upon the approval of the amendments to our articles of association, we will issue non-convertible, non-voting 9%
redeemable perpetual preferred shares with a nominal value of €4.44 each to our parent company, AGSA, for a subscription
price of approximately €250 million (the "Preferred Shares"). The Preferred Shares are expected to provide for annual
cumulative dividends that may accumulate indefinitely if not declared and paid on a yearly basis, and the Preferred Shares
are not expected to include any mandatory redemption provisions or investor put rights. We expect the issuance of the
Preferred Shares to close in July 2022. The issuance of the Preferred Shares is subject to the approval of the amendments
to our articles of association by at least two thirds of the votes cast at the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders
and there can be no assurance that the Preferred Shares will be issued when expected or at all. The preferred shares will be
classified as equity instruments under IFRS in the AMPSA financial statements as the rights of the shares do not give rise


-----

to a contractual obligation on AMPSA to deliver cash or another financial asset. Redemptions of the Preferred Shares and
payment of dividends on these shares are entirely at the discretion of AMPSA.


-----

**CORPORATE AND FINANCING STRUCTURE**

The following diagram provides a simplified summary of the corporate and financing structure of the Group.


-----

The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary Guarantors. The
Subsidiary Guarantors would have accounted for 76% of the aggregate total assets and 68% of the Adjusted EBITDA of
the AMPSA Group as of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2022.

expected results.

The pro forma financial data in respect of pro forma net interest expense, pro forma net debt, ratio of Adjusted
EBITDA to pro forma net interest expense and ratio of pro forma net debt to Adjusted EBITDA as of and for the twelve
months ended March 31, 2022 presented and described in the notes thereto reflects the impact of giving effect to the
Offering and the proceeds from the issuance of the Preferred Shares. This unaudited pro forma financial data is based on
available information and various assumptions that management believes to be reasonable.

(1) The income statement data presented includes certain exceptional items which, by their incidence or nature, should be considered and evaluated
separately, in the view of management, to enable a better understanding of the financial performance of AMPSA. A summary of these exceptional
items included in the income statement data is as follows:


**Twelve**
**months**

**Year ended and as of December** **Three months ended and** **ended**
**31,** **as of March 31,** **and as of**

**March**

**2021** **2020** **2019** **2022** **2021** **2022**

**Exceptional operating items** **272** **20** **15** **18** **6** **284**

For further details on the exceptional operating items for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, see Note 5 to the Unaudited Interim
Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2022. For further details on the exceptional operating items for
the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, see note 5 to the Audited Financial Statements, incorporated by reference in this Offering
Memorandum.

(2) Net interest expense represents net finance expense/income excluding exceptional finance items, net pension interest cost, foreign currency
translation losses/(gains), losses on derivative financial instruments, and other net finance expense. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2022,
net finance expense includes $51 million of exceptional finance income, comprising of a gain on movements in the fair market values of $56
million on the earnout shares and public and private warrants and a foreign currency translation gain of $13 million on the promissory note issued
by the Company to AGSA as part of the consideration in connection with the Business Combination, partly offset by a foreign currency loss of
$18 million on the earnout shares and public and private warrants.

(3) Adjusted EBITDA consists of (loss)/profit before tax, net finance expense/income, depreciation and amortization, and exceptional operating items.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are presented
because we believe that they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating companies in the
packaging industry. However, other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in a manner different from ours.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered an
alternative to profit/(loss) as indicators of operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with IFRS.

The reconciliation of (loss)/profit for the year to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:


-----

**Three months ended** **Twelve**

**and as of March 31,** **months**

**Year ended and as of December** **ended**
**31,** **and as of**

**March**

(Loss)/profit before tax (188) 140 (15) 64 (91) (33)
Net finance expense/(income) 235 70 213 (23) 149 63
Depreciation and amortization 343 315 290 86 84 345
Exceptional operating items 272 20 15 18 6 284
**Adjusted EBITDA** **662** **545** **503** **145** **148** **659**

(4) Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.

(5) Capital expenditure is the sum of purchase of property, plant and equipment and software and other intangibles, net of proceeds from disposal of
property, plant and equipment.

(6) Working capital is comprised of inventories, trade and other receivables, contract assets, trade and other payables and current provisions.

Current provisions (10) (13) (14) (16)
**Working capital** **(179)** **(99)** **(139)** **166**

(7) Net debt equals total borrowings, less cash and cash equivalents and deferred debt issuance costs.

(8) The ratio of pro forma net debt to Adjusted EBITDA is 3.7x. Pro forma net debt is $2,471 million and is derived from reported net debt at March
31, 2022 of $2,746 million as adjusted to give effect to the Offering, the proceeds from the issuance of the Preferred Shares and the initial use of
the proceeds thereof as if these events occurred on March 31, 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2022 is $659
million. In calculating this ratio, we have used a euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate of €1.00 to $1.11, the exchange rate used in preparing our balance
sheet on March 31, 2022. We do not intend to retain the cash received from the Offering and the proceeds from the issuance of Preferred Shares
indefinitely but instead expect to use these proceeds to finance and/or refinance Eligible Green Projects in accordance with the Ardagh Group
Green Financing Frame. See “Capitalization.”

(9) The ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to pro forma net interest expense is 4.9x. Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2022 is $659
million. Pro forma net interest expense is $134 million and is derived from reported net interest expense for the twelve months ended March 31,
2022 of $95 million as adjusted to give effect to the Offering as if it occurred on April 1, 2021. The full year effect of non US dollar denominated
fees and expenses of the Offering have been applied using the twelve months average rate to March 31, 2022 of €1.00 = $1.17.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks,_
_together with other information provided to you in this Offering Memorandum, in deciding whether to invest in the Notes._
_The occurrence of any of the events discussed below could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or_
_results of operations. If these events occur, the trading prices of the Notes could decline, and we may not be able to pay all_
_or part of the interest or principal on the Notes, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks not_
_currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial may also harm us and affect your investment._

_This Offering Memorandum contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual_
_results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such_
_differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See “Forward-Looking_
_Statements.”_

**Risks Relating to Our Business**

_Please see the risks relating to our business incorporated by reference herein from Item 3.D in the Form 20-F._

**Risks Relating to Our Debt, the Notes and the Guarantees**

**_Our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to effectively manage and grow our_**
**_business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the Notes._**

We have a substantial amount of debt and significant debt service obligations. As of March 31, 2022, on a pro
forma basis, after giving effect to the Offering and use of proceeds therefrom, we would have had (i) total debt of $3,604
million, of which $600 million would have been debt incurred in the Offering and (ii) $267 million debt which will mature
prior to the maturity of the Notes. See “Capitalization.”

Our substantial debt could have important negative consequences for us, for our shareholders and for you as a
holder of the Notes. For example, our substantial debt could:

      - require us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow from operations to service debt and fund
repayments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital
expenditures and other general corporate purposes;

      - increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions;

      - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in which we
operate;

      - limit our ability to raise additional debt or equity capital in the future;

      - restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;

      - make it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debt; and

      - place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.

In addition, debt under the ABL Facility bears, and in the future a portion of our other debt may bear, interest at
variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates. Although we may hedge a portion of our exposure to variable
interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps, we cannot assure you that it will do so in the future. As a result, an
increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and debt service obligations, which would exacerbate
the risks associated with its leveraged capital structure.

Further, notwithstanding our current indebtedness levels and restrictive covenants, we may still be able to incur
substantial additional debt or make certain restricted payments, which could exacerbate the risks described above.

Negative developments in our business, results of operations and financial condition due to changes in global
economic conditions or other factors could cause ratings agencies to lower the credit ratings, or ratings outlook, of its shortand long-term debt and, consequently, impair its ability to raise new financing or refinance its current borrowings and
increase its costs of issuing any new debt instruments.


-----

**_Certain of our credit facilities may contain financial covenants which we could fail to meet._**

The ABL Facility requires, and our future credit facilities may require, the Parent Guarantor and certain of its
subsidiaries to satisfy specified financial tests and maintain specified financial ratios and covenants regarding a minimum
level of EBITDA to net interest expense, a minimum level of EBITDA to total debt, and a maximum amount of capital
expenditures, all as defined in such credit facilities. See “Description of Other Indebtedness.”

The ability of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries to comply with these ratios and to meet these tests may be
affected by events beyond their control and there can be no assurances that they will continue to meet these tests. The
failure of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries to comply with these obligations could lead to a default under these
credit facilities unless we can obtain waivers or consents in respect of any breaches of these obligations under these credit
facilities. We cannot assure you that these waivers or consents will be granted. A breach of any of these covenants or the
inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under these credit facilities. In the event of
any default under these credit facilities, the lenders under these facilities will not be required to lend any additional amounts
to us or our operating subsidiaries and could elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest,
fees and other amounts due thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. In the event of a default, the relevant lenders
(and, potentially, the Trustee) could also require us to apply all available cash to repay the borrowings or prevent us from
making debt service payments on the Notes, any of which would be an event of default under these Notes. If the debt under
our credit facilities, the Existing Notes or the Notes were to be accelerated, there can be no assurances that our assets would
be sufficient to repay such debt in full.

**_We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt._**

Subject to the restrictions in our credit facilities, the Indenture, the Existing Indentures and other outstanding debt,
we may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, which could also be secured. See “Description of Other
Indebtedness” and “Summary Consolidated Financial & Other Data of Ardagh Metal Packaging S.A.”

Although the terms of the ABL Facility, the Indenture, the Existing Indentures and other outstanding debt contain
restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and
exceptions, and debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. To the extent new debt is added
to our currently anticipated debt levels, the substantial leverage related risks described above would increase. See also “—
Risks Relating to Our Business—We may incur unforeseen risks and costs relating to acquisitions.”

**_Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and we may not be able to generate the cash_**
**_required to service our debt._**

Our ability to make scheduled payments on the Notes and to meet our other debt service obligations or refinance
our debt depends on our future operating and financial performance and ability to generate cash. This will be affected by
our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory,
technical and other factors beyond our control. If we cannot generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service obligations
or fund our other business needs, we may, among other things, need to refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the
Notes, obtain additional financing, delay planned acquisitions or capital expenditures or sell assets. There can be no
assurances that we will be able to generate sufficient cash through any of the foregoing. If we are not able to refinance any
of our debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to
satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt, including the Notes. See “The AMP Business.”

We expect to be able to repay or refinance the principal amounts outstanding under our outstanding indebtedness
(including the Notes) upon maturity. We may, however, be unable to repay or refinance such principal amounts on terms
satisfactory to us or at all.

**_Restrictions imposed by the Indenture, the Existing Indentures, the ABL Facility and other future credit facilities may_**
**_limit our ability to take certain actions._**

The Indenture, the Existing Indentures, the ABL Facility limit, and other future credit facilities may limit, our
flexibility in operating our business. For example, these agreements restrict or limit the ability of the Parent Guarantor and
certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things:

      - borrow money;

      - pay dividends or make other distributions;

      - create certain liens;


-----

      - make certain asset dispositions;

      - make certain loans or investments;

      - issue or sell share capital of our subsidiaries;

      - guarantee indebtedness;

      - enter into transactions with affiliates; or

      - merge, consolidate or sell, lease or transfer all or substantially all of our assets.

There can be no assurances that the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in the Indenture, the Existing
Indentures, the ABL Facility and certain of our other credit facilities will not adversely affect our ability to finance our
future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest. Any future indebtedness
may include similar or other restrictive terms. In addition, the management believes that the future expansion of our
packaging business may require participation in the consolidation of the packaging industry by the acquisition of existing
packaging businesses. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to participate in such consolidation or that the operating
and financial restrictions and covenants in the Indenture, the Existing Indentures, the ABL Facility and certain of our other
credit facilities will permit us to do so.

In addition to limiting our flexibility in operating our business, a breach of the covenants in the Indenture could
cause a default under the terms of our other financing agreements, including the ABL Facility, causing all the debt under
those agreements to be accelerated. If this were to occur, we can make no assurances that we would have sufficient assets
to repay our debt.

**_We may be unable to repurchase the Notes as required upon a Change of Control._**

If we experience a Change of Control, we would be required to make an offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes
and Existing Notes at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase.
However, we may be unable to do so because we might not have enough available funds, particularly since a Change of
Control could in certain circumstances cause part or all of our other debt to become due and payable. See “Description of
the Notes—Change of Control.”

**_The insolvency laws of Luxembourg and other local insolvency laws may not be as favorable to you as U.S. bankruptcy_**
**_laws or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar._**

Ardagh Metal Packaging, the Parent Guarantor, is incorporated in Luxembourg. On the Issue Date, the Notes will
be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Parent Guarantor and secured by a pledge of the shares of Lux Holdco. Subject to
the Agreed Security Principles, within 90 days following the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Subsidiary
Guarantors. The Subsidiary Guarantors of the Notes are incorporated under the laws of one of England & Wales, Germany,
Ireland, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Switzerland and the United States. The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions
may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar.
In the event that any one or more of the Issuers, the Guarantors or any other of Ardagh Metal Packaging’s subsidiaries
experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency
or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

**_The Issuers’ ability to pay principal and interest on the Notes may be affected by our organizational structure. The_**
**_Issuers are dependent upon payments from other members of our corporate group to fund payments to you on the Notes,_**
**_and such other members might not be able to make such payments in some circumstances._**

The Issuers do not conduct any business operations and do not have any assets or sources of income of their own,
other than the intercompany notes made to on-lend the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes as described below. As
a result, the Issuers’ ability to make payments on the Notes is dependent directly upon interest or other payments they
receive from other members of our corporate group. Initially, the proceeds of the Notes will be loaned to other members
of our corporate group pursuant to intercompany notes. These intercompany notes may be subordinated to senior debt of
the relevant intercompany borrowers. The Indenture will not require the maintenance of these intercompany notes.
Accordingly, you should only rely on the Guarantees of the Notes, and not these intercompany notes, to provide credit
support in respect of payments of principal or interest on the Notes. The ability of other members of our corporate group
to make payments to the Issuers will depend upon their cash flows and earnings which, in turn, will be affected by all of
the factors discussed in these “Risk Factors” or those risk factors incorporated by reference herein.


-----

Furthermore, credit facilities that we may enter into in the future may contain certain restrictions on the borrowers
thereunder from making certain distributions or payments of capital or income to their members. As a result, the amounts
that the Issuers expect to receive from other members of our corporate group may not be forthcoming or sufficient to enable
the Issuers to service their obligations on the Notes.

The Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary Guarantors will guarantee the Notes. The Parent Guarantor is a holding
company with no assets or sources of income of its own and thus is dependent on dividends and other distributions from
its subsidiaries. The Subsidiary Guarantors are either intermediate holding companies or operating subsidiaries of the
Parent Guarantor.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Guarantees or the Security Interests across multiple_**
**_jurisdictions may prove difficult._**

The Notes will be issued by the Issuers, incorporated under the laws of Ireland and the United States. On the Issue
Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg, and will be secured
by pledge over the Parent Guarantor’s shares in the share capital of Lux Holdco. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles,
within 90 days following the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors and secured, subject
to the Intercreditor Agreement and certain perfection requirements, by the Collateral. The Subsidiary Guarantors are
incorporated under the laws of one of England & Wales, Germany, Ireland, The Netherlands, Switzerland, the United States
and Luxembourg. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these
countries. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for creditors, and otherwise may result
in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights, including with respect to the appropriate
jurisdiction in which to enforce any of the foregoing security interests. Your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees, and
any related collateral will be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no
assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar proceedings due to local corporate, bankruptcy or insolvency laws, international laws, conflicts of laws principles
or otherwise. If your rights are found to be unenforceable in any jurisdiction, you may be required to seek to enforce your
rights in other jurisdictions, and it may be unclear in which jurisdictions such enforcement action could be taken.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative, general corporate and other laws of the Issuers’ and the
Guarantors’ jurisdictions of organization may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other and those of the
United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors generally and with respect to the enforceability of security
interests, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the
proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular
jurisdiction’s law should apply and whether a particular jurisdiction is the appropriate one for the enforcement of share
pledge and other security interests securing the Notes and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under
the Notes and the Guarantees in these jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

The laws of certain of the jurisdictions in which the Subsidiary Guarantors are organized limit the ability of these
subsidiaries to guarantee debt of a sister company. See “—Corporate benefit, capital maintenance laws and other limitations
on the Guarantees and the Security Interests may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the
Notes and the Security Interests.”

**_An active trading market may not develop for the Notes._**

The Notes are new securities for which there is currently no existing market. Although application will be made
for the Notes to be admitted to the Official List of Euronext Dublin and admitted to trading on its Global Exchange Market,
we cannot assure you that the Notes will become or will remain listed. We cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any
market that may develop for the Notes, the ability of holders of the Notes to sell them or the price at which the holders of
the Notes may be able to sell them. The liquidity of any market for the Notes will depend on the number of holders of the
Notes, prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities and other factors, including general economic conditions
and our own financial condition, performance and prospects, as well as recommendations by securities analysts.
Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt, such as the Notes, has been subject to disruptions that have caused
substantial price volatility. There can be no assurances that if a market for the Notes were to develop, such a market would
not be subject to similar disruptions. We have been informed by the Initial Purchasers that they intend to make a market
for the Notes after the offering is completed. However, the Initial Purchasers are not obligated to do so and may cease their
market-making activity at any time without notice. In addition, such market-making activity will be subject to limitations
imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and other applicable laws and regulations. As a result, we cannot assure you that an
active trading market for the Notes will develop or, if one does develop, that it will be maintained.


-----

**_The Notes are subject to restrictions on transfer._**

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any U.S. state securities laws.
You may not offer the Notes in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, or pursuant to an effective
registration statement. We have not undertaken to register the Notes or to effect any exchange offer for the Notes in the
future. Furthermore, we have not registered the Notes under any other country’s securities laws. It is your obligation to
ensure that your offers and sales of the Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities
laws. See “Notice to Investors.”

**_Certain considerations relating to book-entry interests._**

Unless and until the Notes are in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes, are issued in exchange
for book-entry interests, owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. DTC, or its
nominee, will be the registered holder of the Regulation S Global Notes and the Rule 144A Global Notes (as such terms
are defined in “Book-entry; Delivery and Form”). After payment to DTC’s custodian, we, the Trustee and the Principal
Paying Agent will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners
of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of DTC and if you
are not a participant in DTC on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any
rights and obligations of a holder under the Indenture. See “Book-entry; Delivery and Form.”

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act
upon our solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if you own a
book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from
DTC or, if applicable, a participant. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies
will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any request actions on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until definitive registered
notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to acting
through DTC. We, the Trustee, and the Principal Paying Agent cannot assure you that the procedures to be implemented
through DTC will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes. See “Book-entry; Delivery and
Form.”

**_You may be unable to serve process on us or our directors and officers in the United States and enforce U.S. judgments_**
**_based on the Notes._**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor incorporated under the laws of
Luxembourg, and secured by a pledge of the shares of Lux Holdco. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, within
90 days following the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors. The Subsidiary Guarantors
are incorporated under the laws of one of England & Wales, Germany, Ireland, The Netherlands, Switzerland, the United
States and Luxembourg. Furthermore, most of the directors and executive officers of the Issuers and such Guarantors live
outside the United States. Substantially all of the assets of Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance and the Guarantors (other than
the Subsidiary Guarantors in Delaware (United States)), and substantially all of the assets of their directors and executive
officers, are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for you to serve process on such persons
in the United States or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against them based on the civil liability provisions of
the securities laws of the United States. In addition, Dutch, English, German, Irish, Luxembourg and Swiss counsel have
informed us that it is questionable whether a Dutch, English, German, Irish, Luxembourg or Swiss court would accept
jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced in England & Wales, Germany, Ireland, The
Netherlands, Luxembourg or Switzerland predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. See “Service of Process and
Enforcement of Judgments.”

**_Corporate benefit, capital maintenance laws and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Security Interests may_**
**_adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes and the Security Interests._**

The laws of certain of the jurisdictions in which the Subsidiary Guarantors are organized limit the ability of these
subsidiaries to guarantee debt of a related company or grant security on account of a related company’s debts. These
limitations arise under various provisions or principles of corporate law which include rules governing capital maintenance,
under which, among others, the risks associated with a guarantee or grant of security on account of a parent company’s
debt need to be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the guarantor’s or grantor’s perspective, as
well as thin capitalization, unfair consideration, financial assistance, corporate purpose or similar law affecting the rights
of creditors generally and fraudulent transfer principles. If these limitations were not observed, the Guarantees and the
grant of Security Interests by these Subsidiary Guarantors could be subject to legal challenge. In some jurisdictions, the
Guarantees will contain language limiting the amount of debt guaranteed or secured so that applicable local law restrictions


-----

will not be violated. Certain of the Security Documents will contain similar limitations. Accordingly, if you were to enforce
the Guarantees by a Subsidiary Guarantor in one of these jurisdictions or seek to enforce a Security Interest in Collateral
granted by a Subsidiary Guarantor in one of these jurisdictions, your claims are likely to be limited. In some cases, where
the amount that can be guaranteed or secured is limited by reference to the net assets and legal capital of the Subsidiary
Guarantors or by reference to the outstanding debt owed by the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor to the Issuers under
intercompany loans, that amount might have reached zero or close to zero at the time of any insolvency or enforcement.
Furthermore, although we believe that the Guarantees by these Subsidiary Guarantors and the Security Interests granted by
these Subsidiary Guarantors will be validly given in accordance with local law restrictions, there can be no assurance that
a third-party creditor would not challenge these Guarantees and the Security Interests and prevail in court.

The Indenture will provide that, except under very limited circumstances, only the Trustee or the Security Agent,
as applicable, will have standing to bring an enforcement action in respect of the Notes and the Guarantees and the Security
Interests. Moreover, the Intercreditor Agreement restricts the rights of holders of the Notes to initiate insolvency
proceedings or take other legal actions against the Subsidiary Guarantors, and by accepting any Note, you will be deemed
to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and
recourse under the Guarantees and the Security Interests in the event of a default by any of the Issuers or a Subsidiary
Guarantor.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries._**

Some, but not all, of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. Generally, holders of indebtedness of, and trade
creditors of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of
their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to any Guarantor,
as direct or indirect shareholders.

Accordingly, in the event that any of the non-guarantor subsidiaries becomes insolvent, liquidates or otherwise
reorganizes:

      - the creditors of the Guarantors (including the holders of the Notes) will have no right to proceed against such
subsidiary’s assets; and

      - creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in
full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before any Guarantor, as direct or indirect
shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

As of March 31, 2022, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Offering, our non-guarantor subsidiaries
would have had $30 million of debt outstanding and $156 million of trade payables and deferred taxes, all of which would
have ranked structurally senior to the Notes and the Guarantees. See “Capitalization”.

**_Insolvency laws and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Security Interests, including fraudulent conveyance_**
**_statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

On the Issue Date, our obligations under the Notes will be guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor incorporated under
the laws of Luxembourg and will be secured by pledge over the Parent Guarantor’s shares in the share capital of Lux
Holdco. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, within 90 days following the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed
by the Subsidiary Guarantors and secured, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and certain perfection requirements, by
the Collateral. The Subsidiary Guarantors of the Notes are incorporated under the laws of one of England & Wales,
Germany, Ireland, The Netherlands, Switzerland, the United States and Luxembourg.

Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and
equitable principles, insolvency laws and, in the case of the Guarantees and the Security Interests, limitations on the
enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Guarantee against
a Guarantor and the enforceability of the Security Interests. The court or an insolvency administrator may also in certain
circumstances avoid the Security Interest or the Guarantee where the company is close to or in the vicinity of insolvency.
The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally
applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency
statutes.

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency
administrator may challenge the Guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as
fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings,
to:


-----

      - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee or the Security Interests;

      - direct that holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee or any security to the relevant
Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors; and

      - take other action that is detrimental to you.

If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Guarantee or Security Interest is found to be a
fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts
outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee or the Security Interests will
be limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee or Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance
or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors under the
Security Documents will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in
making a determination of the maximum liability of each. Also, there is a possibility that the Guarantees or the Security
Interests may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would need
to find that, at the time the Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests created, the relevant Guarantor:

      - issued such Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding
current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after
its insolvency;

      - issued such Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent businessman as a
shareholder of such Guarantor would have contributed equity to such Guarantor; or

      - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Guarantee or Security
Interest on the basis that the Guarantee or Security Interest were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly
the Guarantor’s benefit, or some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the
issuance of the Guarantee or the creation of the Security Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other
reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s assets
were unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make
required payments as and when they would become due.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor generally may, in different
jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantee or created any Security Interest if:

      - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

      - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; and/or

      - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and
liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute.

Although we believe that we are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Offering, there can be no
assurance which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” as of the date the
Guarantees were issued the Security Interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not
determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a
Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued or Security Interests were created, that payments to holders
of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

**_We do not present separate financial statements for each Subsidiary Guarantor._**

We have not presented in this Offering Memorandum separate financial statements for each Subsidiary Guarantor,
and we are not required to do so in the future under the Indenture.

**_You will not have the benefit of the guarantees from any of the Subsidiary Guarantors on the Issue Date._**

The Guarantees, other than the guarantees by the Parent Guarantor, will not be in effect until provided by the
relevant Subsidiary Guarantors. It is expected that the Subsidiary Guarantors will, subject to the Agreed Security Principles,
provide guarantees on the Notes, within 90 days following the Issue Date.

**_The Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors seeking exposure to “green” assets._**


-----

Pursuant to the recommendation of the Green Bond Principles 2018 that issuers use external assurance to confirm
their alignment with the key features of the Green Bond Principles 2018, ISS Corporate Solutions has been engaged to
provide an independent second party opinion (the “Second Party Opinion”) in relation to the alignment of the Ardagh
Group Green Financing Framework with the Green Bond Principles 2018. Accordingly, on February 23, 2021, ISS
Corporate Solutions certified that the Ardagh Group Green Financing Framework aligns with the Green Bond Principles
2018. The Second Party Opinion is not incorporated into, and does not form part of, this Offering Memorandum.

There is currently no clearly defined definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus on what
precise attributes are required for a particular company to be defined as “green”, “sustainable” or such other equivalent
label, and nor can any assurance be given that such a clear definition or consensus will develop over time. Accordingly,
we cannot assure you that the Eligible Green Projects will meet all investor expectations or requirements regarding “green”,
“sustainable”, “social” or similar labels (including Regulation (EU) 2020/852 on the establishment of a framework to
facilitate sustainable investment). Further, no assurances can be provided that allocations to projects with these specific
characteristics will be made by us with respect to an amount equal to the net proceeds from the Notes. There is no guarantee
as to the environmental and/ or social impacts of the Eligible Green Projects.

Neither the Issuers, the Parent Guarantor, the Initial Purchasers nor the Trustee make any representation as to (i)
the suitability of any opinion or certification of any third party (whether or not solicited by the Issuers or the Parent
Guarantor) or the Notes to fulfil any environmental and sustainability criteria; (ii) whether the Notes will meet investor
criteria and expectations with regard to environmental impact and sustainability performance; (iii) whether an amount equal
to the net proceeds of the Notes will be used to finance and/or refinance new and/or existing Eligible Green Projects; or
(iv) the characteristics of the Eligible Green Projects, including their environmental and sustainability criteria. The Second
Party Opinion may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors
discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. The Second Party Opinion is not a recommendation
to buy, sell or hold securities and is only current as at the date of the Second Party Opinion.

In the event that the Notes are listed or admitted to trading on any dedicated “green”, “environmental”,
“sustainable” or other equivalently-labelled segment of any stock exchange or securities market (whether or not regulated),
no representation or assurance is given by the Issuers, the Parent Guarantor, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee or any other
person that such listing or admission satisfies, whether in whole or in part, any present or future investor expectations or
requirements as regards any investment criteria or guidelines with which such investor or its investments are required to
comply, whether by any present or future applicable law or regulations or by its own by-laws or other governing rules or
investment portfolio mandates, in particular with regard to any direct or indirect environmental, sustainability or social
impact of any projects or uses, the subject of or related to, any Eligible Green Projects. Furthermore, it should be noted
that the criteria for any such listings or admission to trading may vary from one stock exchange or securities market to
another. No representation or assurance can be given or made by the Issuers, the Parent Guarantor, the Initial Purchasers,
the Trustee or any other person that any such listing or admission to trading will be obtained in respect of any such Notes
or, if obtained, that any such listing or admission to trading will be maintained during the life of the Notes.

Each potential investor in the Notes must make its own determination with respect to the relevance of the
information contained in this Offering Memorandum regarding the use of proceeds, and its purchase of Notes should be
based upon such investigation as it deems necessary. A withdrawal of the Second Party Opinion or any failure by the
Ardagh Group to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to Eligible Green Projects or
to meet or continue to meet the investment requirements of certain environmentally focused investors with respect to the
Notes may affect the value of the Notes and/or may have consequences for certain investors with portfolio mandates to
invest in “green” assets.

**_Investors may have limited remedies if we fail to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the Notes towards_**
**_Eligible Green Projects or to satisfy related reporting requirements and other undertakings._**

Although we plan to allocate an amount of funding equivalent to the net proceeds of the offering of the Notes to
finance and/or refinance, in whole or in part, Eligible Green Projects in accordance with the Ardagh Group Green Financing
Framework and we will exercise our judgment and sole discretion in determining what constitutes an Eligible Green Project
and all other matters relating to the implementation of the Ardagh Group Green Financing Framework. If the use of
proceeds of the Notes is a factor in your decision to invest in the Notes, you should consider the disclosure in the “Use of
Proceeds” section below and consult with your advisors before making an investment in the Notes. You must determine
for yourself the relevance of such information for the purpose of any investment together with any other investigation you
deem necessary.


-----

We, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee and any other person cannot assure you that: (i) the use of such proceeds
will meet the requirements set out in the Ardagh Group Green Financing Framework, whether in whole or in part, or any
present or future investor expectations or requirements as regards any investment criteria or guidelines with which such
investor or its investments are required or wish to comply, (ii) the Eligible Green Projects to which we allocate amounts
relating to the Offering will satisfy, or continue to satisfy, investor criteria and expectations regarding environmental impact
and sustainability performance and (iii) the Eligible Green Projects criteria and other aspects of the Ardagh Group Green
Financing Framework will satisfy, or continue to satisfy, investor criteria or expectations for sustainable finance products.
In particular, no assurance is given that the Eligible Green Projects will satisfy, whether in whole or in part, any present or
future investor expectations or requirements, voluntary taxonomies or standards regarding any investment criteria or
guidelines with which such investor or its investments are required to comply, whether by any present or future applicable
laws or regulations, by its own bylaws or other governing rules or investment portfolio mandates, ratings criteria, voluntary
taxonomies or standards or other independent expectations (in particular with regard to any direct or indirect environmental,
sustainability or social impact of any Eligible Green Projects or uses, the subject of or related to, the relevant Eligible Green
Projects). Additionally, the Ardagh Group may revise the Ardagh Group Green Financing Framework from time to time,
and the criteria used by the Ardagh Group to identify Eligible Green Projects may differ in the future. Furthermore, we
cannot assure you that we will be able to identify sufficient business activities qualifying as Eligible Green Projects to
which we could re-allocate amounts equal to the net proceeds from the Offering if the Ardagh Group no longer owns a
previously allocated Eligible Green Project or if a previously allocated Eligible Green Project no longer meets the
applicable criteria.

The market price of the Notes may be impacted by any failure by us to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds
from the Offering to Eligible Green Projects, take the other actions as described under the Ardagh Group Green Financing
Framework or to otherwise meet or continue to meet the investment requirements of certain sustainability-focused
investors. Although we intend to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds from the Offering to Eligible Green Projects
and take the other actions as described under Ardagh Group Green Financing Framework, it will not be an event of default
nor will we be required to repurchase or redeem the Notes if we fail to do so, and holders of the Notes will have no remedies
for any such failure. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the Eligible Green Projects will be capable of being
implemented in or substantially in such manner and/or in accordance with any timing schedule and that accordingly such
funds will be totally or partially disbursed for such Eligible Green Projects. Nor can there be any assurance that such
Eligible Green Projects will be completed within any specified period or at all or with the results or outcome as originally
expected or anticipated by us. Prospective investors should consider the information set out in the Ardagh Group Green
Financing Framework and determine for themselves the relevance of such information for the purpose of an investment in
the Notes together with any other investigation they deem necessary.

No assurance or representation is given by us, any of the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee or any other person as to
the suitability or reliability for any purpose whatsoever of any opinion, report or any other opinion or certification of any
third party (whether or not solicited by us or any affiliate) which may be made available in connection with the Notes or
the Ardagh Group Green Financing Framework, and any such opinion or certification is not, nor should be deemed to be,
a recommendation by us, any of the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee or any other person to invest in the Notes. A withdrawal
of any such opinion or certification may affect the value of the Notes.

**_The value of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under_**
**_the Notes and the Collateral securing the Notes may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances._**

The Notes and the Guarantees are secured by first priority security interests on the Fixed Asset Collateral and
secured on a junior basis on the ABL Collateral as described in this Offering Memorandum. The Collateral also secures
our and our subsidiaries’ obligations under the Existing Secured Notes on a pari passu basis relative to the Notes and certain
hedging obligations (which may receive proceeds from enforcement of Collateral in priority to the Notes). In addition, the
ABL Collateral secures our and our subsidiaries’ obligations in respect of the ABL Facility on a priority basis relative to
the Notes. The Collateral may also secure additional debt to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the
Existing Indentures. Your rights to the Collateral would be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by the Collateral or
a reduction of the Collateral securing the Notes. The ABL Facility has lien priority and other advantages over the Notes
with respect to the ABL Collateral, and the holders of indebtedness under the ABL Facility are entitled to be paid out of
the proceeds of the ABL Collateral upon an insolvency or an enforcement action before the proceeds are applied to pay
obligations with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees.

The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon a sale of such Collateral will depend upon many
factors including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies in which
our operations are located, the availability of buyers and other factors. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied


-----

on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. Portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value. The Collateral is located in a number of countries, and the multi-jurisdictional nature of any
foreclosure on the Collateral may limit the realizable value of the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured
debt or third parties enjoy liens (including statutory liens), whether or not permitted by the Indenture, such holders or third
parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees which, if
exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy the obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_The Security Interests over the Collateral have been, or will be, granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the_**
**_holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law._**

In Germany and The Netherlands, the security over the Collateral that constitutes, or will constitute, security for
the obligations of the Issuers under the Notes and the Indenture is not granted directly to the noteholders but only in favor
of the Security Agent, as beneficiary of parallel debt obligations (“Parallel Debt”). This Parallel Debt was created to satisfy
a requirement under the respective laws of Germany and the Netherlands that the Security Agent, as grantee of certain
types of collateral, be a creditor of the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor. The Parallel Debt is in the same amount and payable
at the same time as the obligations of the Issuers under the Indenture and the Notes (the “Principal Obligations”). Any
payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect
of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. The Security Agent has, pursuant to the
Parallel Debt, a claim against the Issuers for the full principal amount of the Notes. The holders of the Notes are not entitled
to enforce such security except through the Security Agent. Holders of the Notes bear some risks associated with a possible
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. The Parallel Debt obligations referred to above are contained in the
Indenture, which is governed by New York law. There is no assurance that such a structure will be effective before German
or Dutch courts as there is no judicial or other guidance as to its efficacy, and therefore the ability of the Security Agent to
enforce the Collateral may be restricted.

**_You will not have a security interest in all of the Collateral on the Issue Date and you will not have the benefit of the_**
**_guarantees from any of the Subsidiary Guarantors on the Issue Date._**

You will not have a security interest in the Collateral, other than the pledge over Lux Holdco's shares, or
Guarantees from the Subsidiary Guarantors for up to 90 days following the Issue Date. Until such time as all the Collateral
is in place, the Issuers' obligation to pay interest on the Notes will only be secured by the pledge over the shares of Lux
Holdco, and until all of the Subsidiary Guarantees have been provided, the Notes will benefit from only the guarantee of
the Parent Guarantor.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, we will be required under the Indenture to provide security over the
Fixed Asset Collateral and the ABL Collateral within 90 days following the Issue Date. See “Description of the Notes” and
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.” Failure to comply with these obligations would constitute
a default under the Indenture.

Any issues that we are not able to resolve in connection with the delivery of Collateral may negatively impact the
value of the Collateral. To the extent a lien in certain Collateral is perfected following the Issue Date, it might be avoidable
in bankruptcy or create new hardening periods. See “—The granting of the Security Interests in connection with the
issuance of the Notes may create hardening periods for such Security Interests in accordance with the law applicable in
certain jurisdictions.”

**_The granting of the Security Interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes may create hardening periods for_**
**_such Security Interests in accordance with the law applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of new Security Interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes may create hardening periods
for such Security Interests in certain jurisdictions. The applicable hardening period for these new Security Interests will
run as from the moment each new Security Interest has been granted, perfected or recreated. At each time, if the Security
Interest granted, perfected or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in
such jurisdiction, it may be declared void and/or it may not be possible to enforce it.

**_Loans under the ABL Facility or other credit facilities we may enter into may bear interest at floating rates that could_**
**_rise significantly, thereby increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

Loans under the ABL Facility or other credit facilities that we may enter into may bear interest at floating rates of
interest per annum equal to LIBOR or EURIBOR (as the case may be), as adjusted periodically, plus a margin. Although
we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no
assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks,


-----

including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. These
interest rates could also rise significantly in the future. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest
expense associated with the loans under any ABL Facility or other credit facilities we may enter into would correspondingly
increase, thus reducing our cash flow.

LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be
“benchmarks” may be subject to the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013), the European
regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance
of investment funds, the UK onshored version of that European regulation and/or other regulatory guidance and/or reform.
As a result of such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform
differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot
be predicted.

The one-week and 2-month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR ceased to be determined and published on December 31,
2021. The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, has announced that, after 30
June 2023, the overnight and 12-month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR will permanently cease to be determined or published
and, if the remaining 1, 3 and 6 month U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors continue to be published after that date, it will be on the
basis of a changed methodology resulting in unrepresentative settings. The FCA has prohibited use after December 31,
2021 of the continuing U.S. dollar LIBOR settings by UK-supervised entities in new regulated financial contracts,
instruments and/or investment fund performance measurement, although there are some exceptions. Other regulatory
authorities have imposed restrictions on new use of the continuing U.S. dollar LIBOR settings. Although pounds LIBOR
continues to be published in the 1, 3 and 6 month tenors, it is no longer a representative rate and there are considerable
restrictions on its use. The Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates has promoted the use of SONIA
compounded in arrears as the floating rate throughout the sterling wholesale markets.

Future changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement
agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR or any other benchmark is determined,
which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked
to such benchmark (including, but not limited to, the ABL Facility, whose interest rates are linked to LIBOR and
EURIBOR). Any such change, as well as the cessation of such a benchmark or its continuation on an unrepresentative
basis, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in the relevant benchmark settings or a requirement to use an alternative
rate setting which is not equivalent, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at
floating rates of interest.

If a published U.S. dollar LIBOR rate is unavailable, we may be required to substitute an alternative reference
rate, such as a different benchmark interest rate or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), in lieu of U.S. dollar
LIBOR. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has proposed SOFR as its recommended alternative to U.S. dollar
LIBOR and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR rates in April 2018. SOFR is intended to be a
broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight that is collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. However, because
SOFR is a broad U.S. Treasury repo financing rate that represents overnight secured funding transactions, it differs
fundamentally from U.S. dollar LIBOR. For example, SOFR is a secured overnight rate, while U.S. dollar LIBOR is an
unsecured rate that represents interbank funding over different maturities. In addition, SOFR is a backward-looking rate,
in that by the time it is published each day, all the transactions on which it is based will have matured, whereas U.S. dollar
LIBOR is forward-looking. Because of these and other differences, there is no assurance that SOFR will perform in the
same way as U.S. dollar LIBOR would have performed at any time, and there is no guarantee that it is a comparable
substitute for U.S. dollar LIBOR. A change from U.S. dollar LIBOR to any of the proposed alternative reference rates
could result in interest obligations that are more than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that
would have been made on our debt if U.S. dollar LIBOR were available in its current form. Any of these changes could
have a material adverse effect on our financing costs. Moreover, the phase-out of U.S. dollar LIBOR may adversely affect
our assessment of effectiveness or measurement of ineffectiveness for accounting purposes of any interest rate hedging
agreements indexed to U.S. dollar LIBOR.

**_The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

The Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the stated
principal amount of the Notes exceeds their “issue price” by an amount equal to or more than a statutorily defined de
_minimis amount, the Notes will be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and holders subject to U.S. federal_
income taxation will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) as it accrues (on a constant
yield to maturity basis) for U.S. federal income tax purposes in advance of the receipt of the cash payments to which such
OID is attributable, regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For further
discussion, see “Taxation—United States Federal Income Taxation.”


-----

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the gross proceeds of the offering of the Notes will be $600 million.

We intend to use the proceeds of the Offering for general corporate purposes and pay fees and expenses related
to the Offering.

The following table sets out the expected sources and uses of the funds after giving effect to the Offering, as if
each had occurred on March 31, 2022. Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors
including differences from our estimates of fees and expenses.

**Sources** **(in $ millions) Uses** **(in $ millions)**
Notes offered hereby 600 Cash to balance sheet[(1)] 591
Estimated fees and expenses of the Offering[(2)] 9

**Total** 600 **Total** 600

(1) Although the net proceeds of the Offering will be initially used to fund cash to our balance sheet, following the
Issue Date, we intend to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds of the Offering to finance and/or refinance,
in whole or in part, Eligible Green Projects in accordance with the Ardagh Group Green Financing Framework.
See “—The Ardagh Group Green Financing Framework.”

(2) Estimated legal, accounting, underwriting, printing, marketing and other fees and associated out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with the offering, sale and issuance of the Notes.

**The Ardagh Group Green Financing Framework**

We plan to allocate an amount of funding equivalent to the net proceeds of the Offering in accordance with the
Ardagh Group Green Financing Framework.

The Ardagh Group has developed the Ardagh Group Green Financing Framework, available at
https://www.ardaghmetalpackaging.com/userfiles/files/media-centre/614c56a97d0de.pdf, and aimed to attract funding
towards initiatives that lower the Ardagh Group’s carbon footprint and increase the Ardagh Group’s investment in green
and sustainable projects, thereby playing a key role in the transition to a low carbon and circular economy. Through these
initiatives, the Ardagh Group aims to engage closely with investors who are committed to allocating capital in support of
this effort. The Ardagh Group Green Financing Framework provides a clear and transparent set of criteria to enable
investments, which support the transition to a low-carbon economy and create long-term value for stakeholders.

The Green Bond Principles 2018 are a set of voluntary guidelines that recommend transparency and disclosure,
and promote integrity in the development of the green bond market. We believe that the Ardagh Group Green Financing
Framework is consistent with the Green Bond Principles 2018, as promulgated by the International Capital Market
[Association and available at https://www.icmagroup.org/assets/documents/Regulatory/Green-Bonds/Green-Bonds-](https://www.icmagroup.org/assets/documents/Regulatory/Green-Bonds/Green-Bonds-Principles-June-2018-270520.pdf)
[Principles-June-2018-270520.pdf. In reaching such conclusion, we relied in part on an independent second party opinion](https://www.icmagroup.org/assets/documents/Regulatory/Green-Bonds/Green-Bonds-Principles-June-2018-270520.pdf)
from ISS Corporate Solutions, an external assurance provider, confirming the alignment of the Ardagh Group Green
Financing Framework with the Green Bond Principles 2018. The opinion is available on our website at
https://www.ardaghgroup.com/userfiles/files/media-centre/60366c1196a06.pdf.

The Ardagh Group Green Financing Framework outlines the Ardagh Group’s commitments with respect to any
green instrument that will be issued, including the Notes. The following paragraphs set forth elements of the Ardagh Group
Green Financing Framework as it relates to the financing and/or refinancing of Eligible Green Projects by the Ardagh
Group with an amount equal to the net proceeds of the Notes.

**Eligible Green Projects**

An “Eligible Green Project” is an investment and expenditure to be made by us after the issuance date of the Notes
or made by us in the 36 months prior to such date, in projects aligned with the eligibility criteria defined in Ardagh Group’s
Green Financing Framework.


-----

We have identified Eligible Green Projects in a range of categories. These projects are in service of our carbon
footprint reduction strategy as well as supporting our investment in green and sustainable investments which play a key
role in the transition to a low carbon and circular economy:

    - Eco-efficient and/or circular economy adapted products, production technologies and processes and in
particular procurement of recycled aluminum to support increased recycling and use of recycled content in the
manufacturing of beverage cans and procurement of low carbon primary aluminum;

    - Energy efficiency;

    - Renewable energy;

    - Green buildings;

    - Sustainable water and wastewater management;

    - Pollution prevention and control; and

    - Clean transportation.

**Board Sustainability Committee**

The AMPSA Group has established a committee (the “Board Sustainability Committee”) primarily responsible
for (i) governing selecting of projects to be included in the portfolio of Eligible Green Projects (“Eligible Portfolio”), (ii)
managing the Eligible Portfolio to evaluate whether proceeds are being used solely for the financing of projects that meet
the eligibility criteria set out in the Ardagh Group Green Financing Framework and sustainability policies and procedures
of the Ardagh Group and (iii) monitoring on behalf of the sustainability committee of AGSA the developments in the wider
green, social and sustainability bond sector and updating the Ardagh Group Green Financing Framework accordingly.

The Board Sustainability Committee includes non-executive directors of AMPSA, the Chief Operations Officer
and Chief Financial Officer of the Ardagh Group, and the CEO, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Sustainability Officer
of the AMPSA Group, and may also call upon other relevant individuals from the AMPSA Group.

**Management of Proceeds**

After issuance of the Notes, the net proceeds will be managed by our treasury on a portfolio basis. As long as the
Notes remain outstanding, it is intended to exclusively allocate an amount equivalent to the net proceeds of the Offering to
an Eligible Portfolio in line with the Ardagh Group Green Financing Framework’s criteria and evaluation and selection
process.

Ardagh Metal Packaging intends to allocate the net proceeds or an amount equal to the net proceeds of the Notes
to finance or refinance Eligible Green Projects within three years from the date of issuance of the Notes. Any portion of
the net proceeds or an amount equal to the net proceeds of the Notes that have not been allocated to Eligible Green Projects
will be managed in accordance with Ardagh Metal Packaging’s standard liquidity management practices. If a loan is no
longer eligible under the Ardagh Group Green Financing Framework to be part of the Eligible Portfolio, we expect to
remove the loan from the Eligible Portfolio and replace it with another eligible loan as soon as reasonably practicable. The
term of an eligible loan may be shorter or longer than the term of the Notes and may mature or be sold before or after the
maturity date of the Notes.

**Reporting**

We will publish an allocation and impact report no later than 180 days after the close of our fiscal year
commencing with the fiscal year end December 31, 2022, and annually thereafter, until full allocation of the proceeds
issued under the Ardagh Group Green Financing Framework. Such report would be reviewed by the Board Sustainability
Committee on behalf of the sustainability committee of AGSA, and made available on our investor relations website. We
intend, on a best-efforts basis, to align our reporting with the approach described in “Green Bonds – Working Towards a
Harmonized Framework for Impact Reporting (June 2019)” publication by the International Capital Market Association.

**Sustainability**


-----

The AMPSA Group is involved in numerous efforts to promote sustainability, including but not limited to
engaging with local communities in sustainability projects, such as through the “Giving Back” initiatives and by investing
in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (“STEM”) education in local communities. The investment in STEM
education is expected to benefit over 500,000 students over the next 10 years.

In addition, the AMPSA Group promotes zero waste to landfill across all plants.

reflect the net proceeds from the Offering and the issuance of the Preferred Shares, which will initially be
used to fund cash to our balance sheet. See “Use of Proceeds.” We do not intend to retain this cash indefinitely
but instead expect to use these proceeds to finance and/or refinance, in whole or in part, Eligible Green
Projects in accordance with the Ardagh Group Green Financing Framework.
(3) On April 1, 2022, an additional $50 million was drawn under the ABL Facility.
(4) Amounts shown are gross of the approximately $9 million estimated deferred financing costs associated with
the incurrence of the Notes offered hereby.

(6) In connection with the offering of the Preferred Shares, we expect to incur fees and expenses of approximately
$3 million. The amounts presented in the As Adjusted column of the table above are net of fees and expenses
and give effect to the offering of the Preferred Shares. The Preferred Shares are expected to be perpetual
preferred equity instruments with no mandatory redemption provisions or investor put rights, and no cash
payments will be required pursuant to the terms of the Preferred Shares except upon the dissolution of the
Parent Guarantor. If the Parent Guarantor is dissolved or in the event of insolvency, the Preferred Shares will
be junior in right of payment to all of our other debt obligations, including the Parent Guarantor’s obligations
under the Parent Guarantee. See “Summary—Offering of Preferred Shares.”

For further details relating to the debt instruments described above, see Item 5 “Operating and Financial Review
and Prospects” in the Form 20-F incorporated by reference in this Offering Memorandum, “Description of Other
Indebtedness,” and “Description of the Notes.”

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

_The following contains a summary of the material terms of our certain financing arrangements. The following_
_summaries are not complete and are subject to the full text of the documents described below._

**Existing Senior Secured Notes**

In March 2021, the 3.250% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 and the 2.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 were
issued in an offering not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. The Existing Senior Secured
Notes are governed by an indenture between, inter alios, the Issuers, Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as trustee for the
holders, and the Guarantors.

The Existing Senior Secured Notes are the joint and several general obligations of the Issuers and rank equally in
right of payment with all existing and future indebtedness of each co-issuer that is not subordinated in right of payment to
the Existing Senior Secured Notes, including the Notes following the Issue Date; rank senior in right of payment to any
and all of the existing and future indebtedness of each co-issuer that is subordinated in right of payment to the Existing
Senior Secured Notes; and are effectively subordinated to any indebtedness of Ardagh Metal Packaging S.A.’s subsidiaries
that do not provide guarantees.

The Existing Senior Secured Notes are also subject to certain customary negative covenants, reporting
requirements and events of default. Upon certain events constituting a change of control under the terms of the Existing
Senior Secured Notes, we would be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Existing Senior Secured Notes at a price
equal to 101% of the principal amount tendered plus accrued interest and other amounts payable, if any, in respect of the
Existing Senior Secured Notes.

The Existing Senior Secured Notes will mature on September 1, 2028.

The Existing Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed on a senior basis by Ardagh Metal Packaging S.A. and by

**Existing Senior Notes**

In March 2021, the 4.000% Senior Notes due 2029 and the 3.000% Senior Notes due 2029 were issued in an
offering not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. The Existing Senior Notes are governed by
an indenture between, inter alios, the Issuers, Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as trustee for the holders, and the Guarantors.

The Existing Senior Notes are the joint and several general obligations of the Issuers and rank equally in right of
payment with all existing and future unsecured indebtedness of each co-issuer that is not subordinated in right of payment
to the Existing Senior Notes; rank senior in right of payment to any and all of the existing and future indebtedness of each
co-issuer that is subordinated in right of payment to the Existing Senior Notes; and are effectively subordinated to any

Senior Secured Notes, the ABL Facility and the Notes, to the extent of the value of the Collateral..

The Existing Senior Notes are also subject to certain customary negative covenants, reporting requirements and
events of default. Upon certain events constituting a change of control under the terms of the Existing Senior Notes, we
would be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Existing Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal
amount tendered plus accrued interest and other amounts payable, if any, in respect of the Existing Senior Notes.

The Existing Senior Notes will mature on September 1, 2029.

The Existing Senior Notes are guaranteed on a senior basis by Ardagh Metal Packaging S.A. and on a senior
subordinated basis by certain wholly owned subsidiaries of Ardagh Metal Packaging S.A. The guarantee of the Existing
Senior Notes by each guarantor ranks equally in right of payment with all existing and future indebtedness of such guarantor
that is not subordinated (and is not senior) in right of payment to such guarantee; ranks senior in right of payment to any


-----

and all of the existing and future indebtedness of such guarantor that is subordinated in right of payment to such guarantee;
and is subordinated in right of payment to any and all of such subsidiary guarantor’s existing and future senior debt,
including the guarantors’ guarantees of the Notes following the granting of such guarantees and the Existing Senior Secured
Notes.

**ABL Facility**

**_Overview_**

On August 6, 2021, Ardagh Metal Packaging S.A. and certain of its subsidiaries (certain of such subsidiaries, the
“Borrowers”) entered into a senior secured asset-based multicurrency revolving credit facility (the “ABL Facility”)
available to the Borrowers. The ABL Facility is provided by a syndicate of financial institutions (collectively, the “ABL
Lenders”), with Bank of America, N.A. acting as administrative agent for the purpose of, among other things, financing
ongoing working capital and general corporate purposes of the Borrowers and the other subsidiaries of Ardagh Metal
Packaging S.A. The ABL Facility is guaranteed by Ardagh Metal Packaging S.A., and certain of the Borrowers (with
respect to the obligations of certain other Borrowers), and certain other subsidiaries of Ardagh Metal Packaging S.A.
Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, no person shall guarantee the Notes unless such person also guarantees the ABL
Facility (the “ABL Guarantors” and, together with Ardagh Metal Packaging S.A. and the Borrowers, the “ABL Loan
Parties”). The ABL Facility is secured by assets of the ABL Loan Parties, with a first priority lien on the ABL Collateral
(as defined below) and a junior lien on the Fixed Asset Collateral, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and
subject to certain exclusions.

**_Final Maturity_**

The ABL Facility matures on August 6, 2026.

**_Borrowings_**

Borrowings under the ABL Facility are made available in U.S. dollars, pounds and euros. A portion of the ABL
Facility is available for issuing letters of credit and for making swingline loans. The borrowings under the ABL Facility
may be prepaid without premium or penalty. ABL Facility contains customary mandatory prepayment requirements if the
outstanding thereunder exceed the availability.

Borrowings by each Borrower are limited by the borrowing base applicable to such Borrower as set forth in the
ABL Facility.

**_Covenants_**

The ABL Facility is subject to a springing financial covenant that requires Ardagh Metal Packaging S.A. to
maintain a 1.0 to 1.0 fixed charge coverage ratio, tested quarterly, if global borrowing availability is less than 10% of the
lesser of (i) the commitments as of such date and (ii) the global borrowing base as of such date. This financial covenant is
subject to customary equity cure provisions. If such availability level is subsequently exceeded for a period of 30
consecutive calendar days, the testing of such financial covenant would be suspended.

The ABL Facility also includes representations, warranties and covenants that are generally of a nature customary
for a facility of this type offered to similar borrowers.

**_Events of Default_**

The ABL Facility contains provisions governing certain events of default customary for a facility of this type
offered to similar borrowers. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of payment obligations
under the ABL Facility.

arrangements by any member of the Group of Secured Obligations or Unsecured Obligations permitted under the Debt
Documents shall not constitute the exercise of a right to require any member of the Group to acquire any Obligation) other

as set out in any Secured Document or the Unsecured Documents by any member of the Group, (vi) the exercise of any

Secured Documents or the Unsecured Documents, in each case, to the extent that the exercise of that right gives effect to

any Intra-Group Obligations prior to the occurrence of a Distress Event, and (vii) the suing for, commencing or joining of
any legal or arbitration proceedings against any member of the Group to recover any Obligations; (b) the premature

Collateral”); (d) the entering into of any composition, compromise, assignment or arrangement with any member of the
Group which owes any Obligations, or has given any lien, guarantee or indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect
of the Obligations (other than (A) any action permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement (it being understood that open
market purchases or voluntary prepayments or tender or exchange offers by any member of the Group of Secured
Obligations or Unsecured Obligations permitted under the Debt Documents shall not constitute the exercise of a right to
require any member of the Group to acquire any Obligation), (B) any consensual amendments to or waivers of the Debt
Documents agreed between members of the Group and the relevant creditors where that amendment or waiver does not
constitute a Default under any Secured Document or any Unsecured Document which is not the subject of that amendment
or waiver or (C) any such action constituting an acquisition of Intra-Group Obligations which is permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement); or (e) the petitioning, applying or voting for, or the taking of any formal steps (including the

remedies) and solely to the extent permitted by the Debt Documents), suspension of payments, a moratorium of any
indebtedness, dissolution, administration or reorganization of any member of the Group which owes any Obligations, or
has given any lien, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of any of the Obligations, or any such
member of the assets or any suspension of payments or moratorium of any indebtedness of such member of the Group or
any analogous procedure in any jurisdiction; provided that the following shall not constitute Enforcement Action: (i) the
taking of any action falling within (a)(ii), (iii), (iv) and (vii) or (e) above which is necessary (but only to the extent
necessary) to preserve the validity, existence or priority of claims in respect of Obligations, including the registration of
such claims before any court or governmental authority and the bringing, supporting or joining of proceedings to prevent
any loss of the right to bring, support or join proceedings by reason of applicable limitation periods; (ii) any Primary
Creditor bringing legal proceedings against any person solely for the purpose of (A) obtaining injunctive relief (or any
analogous remedy) to restrain any actual or putative breach of any Debt Document to which it is party, (B) obtaining
specific performance (other than specific performance of an obligation to make a payment) with no claim for damages, or
(C) requesting judicial interpretation of any provision of any Debt Document to which it is party with no claim for damages;
(iii) any Intra-Group Obligations or Subordinated Obligations of a member of the Group being released or discharged in
consideration for the issue of shares in that member of the Group (other than the Company) prior to an acceleration event

any agent, trustee or receiver acting on behalf of that creditor) to challenge the basis on which any sale or disposal is to
take place pursuant to the powers granted to those persons under any relevant documentation; (v) bringing legal
proceedings against any person in connection with any fraud, securities violation or securities or listing regulations;
(vi) allegations of material misstatements or omissions made in connection with the offering materials relating to the Notes
or any other Secured Debt or Unsecured Debt in the form of notes or debt securities or in reports furnished to the holders

**_Creditors_**

_Secured Creditors and Unsecured Creditors: Intercreditor Matters_

The Intercreditor Agreement does not restrict the entry into of other intercreditor and subordination agreements
(including agreements establishing additional first and second lien tranches) by, between and/or among any Secured
Creditors and Unsecured Creditors, to the extent the terms of such agreement address (i) matters relating to the payment
priority as between such parties (or their representatives), (ii) the ability to exercise any rights granted under the
Intercreditor Agreement to such creditors, (iii) other matters customary for intercreditor agreements of such type and
(iv) any other matters related thereto; provided, that such agreement shall not conflict with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement.


-----

_Secured Creditors: Permitted Payments_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Debtors may make payments in respect of the Secured Obligations
(other than Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Obligations) except for such payments that are made in accordance
with the hedging document or cash management document and to the extent such payments are not prohibited under the
Intercreditor Agreement) at any time in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Secured Documents.

_Secured Creditors: Collateral and Guarantees_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that no class of Secured Creditors may take, accept or receive the benefit
of, and no Debtor or Security Provider (as applicable) shall grant or permit to exist, (a) any lien from any member of the
Group in respect of that class of Secured Obligations, in addition to the Fixed Asset Collateral and the ABL Collateral,
provided that, to the extent legally possible and subject to the guarantee and security principles contained in the applicable
Debt Document (the “Agreed Security Principles”), at the same time such lien is also offered either (i) to the applicable
Security Agent as trustee or agent for its benefit and the benefit of all other classes of Secured Creditors; or (ii) in the case
of any jurisdiction in which an effective lien cannot be granted in favor of such Security Agent(s) as trustee or agent for
such Secured Creditors: (A) to such Secured Creditors in respect of their Obligations or (B) to the applicable Security
Agent(s) under a parallel debt structure for their benefit and the benefit of such Secured Creditors, and in each case, ranks
in the same order of priority as provided for in the section “—Ranking and priority”; and (b) any guarantee, indemnity or
other assurance against loss from any member of the Group in respect of their Secured Obligations in addition to (i) those
in the Intercreditor Agreement; (ii) any such guarantee, indemnity or assurance that is given to all the Secured Creditors in
respect of the Secured Obligations owed to them by any member of the Group; or (iii) those in any ABL Credit Agreement
or in any Super Senior Credit Agreement; provided that, in each case, to the extent legally possible and subject to the
Agreed Security Principles, at the same time such guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is also offered to
all other classes of Secured Creditors in respect of their Secured Obligations and ranks in the same order of priority as
described in the section “—Ranking and priority;” provided, further, that this paragraph will not be violated with respect
to any lien securing any Secured Obligations, or any such guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss, if the
applicable Security Agent(s) in respect of all other classes of Secured Obligations are given a reasonable opportunity to
accept a lien on such asset or such guarantee, indemnity or assurance, and such Security Agent(s) expressly declines to
accept a lien on such asset or such guarantee, indemnity or assurance in respect of one or more classes of Secured
Obligations. This paragraph will also not apply with respect to cash and cash equivalents, and deposit accounts and
securities accounts containing solely cash and cash equivalents, that (i) cash collateralize letters of credit issued under the
ABL Documents or the Super Senior Credit Agreement, (ii) cash collateralize defaulting lender participations in letters of
credit, swingline loans or protective advances under the ABL Documents or the Super Senior Credit Agreement, or (iii)
returned or charged-back items under the ABL Documents.

The Intercreditor Agreement does not purport to restrict any Secured Creditor taking, accepting or receiving the
benefit of any lien, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss from any person which is not a member of the
Group in respect of the Secured Obligations.

_Secured Creditors: Limitations on Enforcement_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that no Secured Creditor may take any Enforcement Action under clause (c)
of the definition thereof or (to the extent such action is directly related to the enforcement of Collateral) under clause (e)
of the definition thereof other than as permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement. However, after the occurrence of an
insolvency event in relation to a Debtor or Security Provider, each Secured Creditor may, to the extent it is able to do so
under the relevant documents governing the Secured Obligations, take Enforcement Action under clause (e) of the
definition thereof or claim in the winding up, dissolution, administration, examinership, reorganization or similar
insolvency event of that Debtor or Security Provider for Secured Obligations owing to it (but, for the avoidance of doubt,
may not direct any Security Agent to enforce the Collateral in any manner not permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement).

_Unsecured Creditors: Permitted Payments_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Debtors may make payments in respect of the Unsecured
Obligations at any time in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Unsecured Documents. To the extent that any
Unsecured Document includes provisions subordinating the related Unsecured Obligations to any other Obligations of the
Debtors, the provisions regarding rights of payment, enforcement and subordination, together with any related restrictions
on amendments of those provisions, will be incorporated into the Intercreditor Agreement.

_Unsecured Creditors: Guarantees_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Unsecured Creditors may only take, accept or receive the benefit
of any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss from any member of the Group in respect of the Unsecured


-----

Obligations in addition to (a) those in the Intercreditor Agreement; and (b) any such guarantee, indemnity or assurance that
is given to all the Secured Creditors in respect of the Obligations owed to them by any member of the Group, provided
that, in each case, to the extent legally possible and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, at the same time such
guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is also offered to the other Primary Creditors in respect of their
Obligations with the rank in the same relative order of priority.

The Intercreditor Agreement does not purport to restrict any Unsecured Creditor taking, accepting or receiving
the benefit of any lien, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss from any person which is not a member of the
Group in respect of the Unsecured Obligations.

_Intra-Group Obligations: Restrictions on Payment and Dealings_

Prior to the last Discharge Date to occur in respect of any of the Primary Obligations (the “Final Discharge Date”),
the Debtors shall not, and shall procure that no other member of the Group will, make any payments of the Intra-Group
Obligations at any time unless that payment is otherwise permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement. The Debtors and
members of the Group may make payments in respect of the Intra-Group Obligations (whether of principal, interest or
otherwise) from time to time, except that payments may not be made if, at the time of such payment, an acceleration event
with respect to any of the Secured Obligations or Unsecured Obligations has occurred and is continuing, unless: (i) to the
extent such payment would result in a breach of any Debt Document, the relevant Representatives, as applicable, have
consented to such payment; (ii) that payment is made solely to facilitate the payment of the Primary Obligations or (iii) any
director or officer of any Debtor is required by mandatory law to make or demand payment of the relevant Intra-Group
Obligations in order to avoid personal, civil or criminal liability; so long as no such payment under clause (iii) will be made
with any ABL Collateral or any proceeds thereof prior to the ABL Discharge Date (as defined below).

_Subordinated Obligations: Restrictions on Payment and Dealings_

Prior to the Final Discharge Date, the Debtors shall not, and the Company shall procure that no other member of
the Group will, make, and no Subordinated Creditor will accept, any payments of the Subordinated Obligations at any time
unless that payment is otherwise permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement. Members of the Group may make payments in
respect of the Subordinated Obligations if that payment is, prior to the Final Discharge Date, either (a) permitted by the
outstanding Debt Documents or (b) consented to by the relevant Representatives under any Debt Documents pursuant to
which such payment would result in a breach.

**_Effect of Insolvency Event_**

_General_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, until the last Discharge Date to occur in respect of any of the Secured
Obligations (the “Secured Debt Discharge Date”) in the event that any member of the Group becomes subject to an
insolvency event, including under Title 11 of the United States Code entitled “Bankruptcy,” as now or hereafter in effect,
or any successor statute (the “U.S. Bankruptcy Code”), the Representatives and each other Primary Creditor agree not to
take any action under the applicable insolvency or liquidation proceeding that would be inconsistent with its agreements
in the Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the ABL Agent (before the last Discharge Date in respect of the ABL
Obligations (the “ABL Discharge Date”)) and, before the last Discharge Date in respect of the First Lien Obligations (the
“First Lien Discharge Date”), the Majority First Lien Creditors (as defined below) and, thereafter, the Majority Second
Lien Creditors (as defined below). See “—Enforcement of Security—Manner of Enforcement—Fixed Asset Collateral”.
If any member of the Group commences an insolvency or liquidation proceeding, then the Intercreditor Agreement, which
the parties expressly acknowledge is a “subordination agreement” under section 510(a) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, will
be effective during such insolvency or liquidation proceeding of any such Debtor or Security Provider and the relative
rights as to the Fixed Asset Collateral, the ABL Collateral and proceeds thereof and shall continue after any Debtor or
Security Provider commences such insolvency or liquidation proceeding on the same basis as prior to the date of the
petition.

_Payment of Distributions_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions in respect of Intra-Group Obligations
owed by a member of the Group that is not a Debtor, after the occurrence of an insolvency event in relation to any member
of the Group, any party entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of such member of the Group (in the case of
holders of Existing Senior Secured Notes and Existing Senior Notes and Notes or any Primary Creditor whose Obligations
are in the form of notes or other debt securities outstanding, only to the extent that such amount constitutes enforcement
proceeds of Collateral) in respect of Obligations owed to that party shall, to the extent it is able to do so, direct the person
responsible for the distribution of the assets of such member of the Group to pay that distribution to the applicable Security


-----

Agent until the Secured Debt Discharge Date. The Security Agents shall apply distributions paid to them in accordance
with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Application of proceeds”).

_Set-off_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions in respect of Intra-Group Obligations
owed by a member of the Group that is not a Debtor, to the extent that any member of the Group’s Obligations are
discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise) after the occurrence of an insolvency event in relation to that
member of the Group (in the case of a set-off (mandatory or otherwise) received by holders of Existing Senior Secured
Notes, Existing Senior Notes and Notes or any Primary Creditor whose Obligations are in the form of notes or other debt
securities outstanding, only to the extent that such amount constitutes enforcement proceeds of Collateral), any creditor
that benefited from that set-off shall, to the extent legally permissible, pay an amount equal to the amount of the Obligations
owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the applicable Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Application of Proceeds”). The set-off provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement
do not apply to certain netting by a Hedge Counterparty or any set-off which gives effect to a payment permitted to
Intra-Group Lenders.

_Non-cash Distributions_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, if any Security Agent or any other Primary Creditor receives a
distribution in a form other than in cash in respect of any of the Obligations, the Obligations will not be reduced by that
distribution until and except to the extent that the realization proceeds are actually applied towards the Obligations.

_Filing of Claims_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an insolvency event in relation to any member
of the Group, each Secured Creditor (including holders of Existing Senior Secured Notes) irrevocably authorizes the Fixed
Asset Security Agent, on its behalf, to: (a) take any Enforcement Action (in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and the relevant Debt Documents of such creditor) against such Group member in respect of the Fixed Asset
Obligations; (b) demand, sue, prove and give receipt for any or all of such Group member’s Fixed Asset Obligations;
(c) collect and receive all distributions on, or on account of, any or all of such Group member’s Fixed Asset Obligations;
and (d) file claims, take proceedings and do all other things the Fixed Asset Security Agent considers reasonably necessary
to recover such Group member’s Fixed Asset Obligations.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an insolvency event in relation to any member
of the Group, each Secured Creditor (including holders of Existing Senior Secured Notes) irrevocably authorizes the ABL
Security Agent, on its behalf, to: (a) take any Enforcement Action (in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and the relevant Debt Documents of such creditor) against such Group member in respect of the ABL
Obligations; (b) demand, sue, prove and give receipt for any or all of such Group member’s ABL Obligations; (c) collect
and receive all distributions on, or on account of, any or all of such Group member’s ABL Obligations; and (d) file claims,
take proceedings and do all other things the ABL Security Agent considers reasonably necessary to recover such Group
member’s ABL Obligations.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, subject to the foregoing, after the occurrence of an insolvency event
in relation to any member of the Group, each Secured Creditor irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent to (a) take any
Enforcement Action (in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Debt Documents of
such creditor) against such Group member in respect of the Subordinated Obligations; (b) demand, sue, prove and give
receipt for any or all of such Group member’s Subordinated Obligations; (c) collect and receive all distributions on, or on
account of, any or all of such Group member’s Subordinated Obligations; and (d) file claims, take proceedings and do all
other things the Security Agent considers reasonably necessary to recover such Group member’s Subordinated Obligations.

_Further Assurance; Insolvency Event_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that each Secured Creditor (including holders of Existing Senior Secured
Notes) will (a) do all things that each of the Security Agents reasonably requests in order to give effect to the provisions
described in this “—Effect of insolvency event” section and (b) if the Security Agents are not entitled to take any of the
actions contemplated by the “—Effect of insolvency event” provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or if the applicable
Security Agent reasonably requests that a Secured Creditor take that action, undertake such action in accordance with the
instructions of such Security Agent or grant a power of attorney to such Security Agent (on such terms as such Security
Agent may reasonably require) to enable such Security Agent to take such action; provided that nothing in this paragraph
will permit any Security Agent to request any action which would contravene any other provision of the Intercreditor
Agreement or to allow a Security Agent to exercise, or cause any Secured Creditor to exercise, any Enforcement Action to


-----

the extent that Security Agent was not permitted to undertake such Enforcement Action under another provision of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

_Financing Matters_

Until the Discharge Date in respect of the ABL Facilities Obligations and the ABL Agent Obligations (the “ABL
Facilities Discharge Date”), if any Debtor or Security Provider becomes subject to an insolvency or liquidation proceeding
and the ABL Security Agent shall desire to permit (or to direct the Common ABL Security Agent to permit) the use of
“cash collateral” (as such term is defined in Section 363(a) of the Bankruptcy Code) constituting ABL Collateral on which
the ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent or any other creditor has a lien or to permit any Debtor or
Security Provider to obtain financing, whether from any ABL Creditor or any other person under Section 364 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law (“DIP Financing”) that is secured at least
in part by the ABL Collateral, then, the Fixed Asset Security Agent, on behalf of itself and the Fixed Asset Creditors,
agrees that it will raise no objection to such use of cash collateral or DIP Financing provided such use of cash collateral or
DIP Financing meets the following requirement: the terms of the use of cash collateral or DIP Financing (A) do not compel
the applicable Debtor or Security Provider to seek confirmation of a specific plan of reorganization or similar dispositive
restructuring plan for which all or substantially all of the material terms are set forth in the order authorizing such use of
cash collateral, DIP Financing documentation or a related document, (B) do not expressly require the liquidation of the
Collateral prior to a default under the DIP Financing documentation or the order authorizing the use of cash collateral, and
(C) do not require that any lien of the Fixed Asset Security Agent on the Fixed Asset Collateral be subordinated to or rank
_pari passu with any lien on the Fixed Asset Collateral securing such DIP Financing. To the extent the liens securing the_
ABL Obligations are subordinated to or pari passu with the liens securing such DIP Financing which meets the requirement
in the immediately preceding sentence, the Fixed Asset Security Agent will subordinate its liens on the ABL Collateral to
the liens thereon securing such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) and will not request adequate protection
or any other relief in connection therewith (except, as expressly agreed by the ABL Security Agent or to the extent permitted
in the manner set forth below). If, in connection with any cash collateral use or DIP Financing, any liens on the ABL
Collateral held by the ABL Creditors are subject to a surcharge or are subordinated to an administrative priority claim, a
professional fee “carve-out,” or fees owed to the United States Trustee, then the liens on the ABL Collateral of the Fixed
Asset Creditors shall also be subordinated to such interest or claim and shall remain subordinated to the liens on the ABL
Collateral of the ABL Creditors consistent with the other terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent and the holders of ABL Obligations will agree to
similar limitations with respect to their right to object to any use of cash collateral constituting Fixed Asset Collateral or to
any DIP Financing to be secured at least in part by the Fixed Asset Collateral that has been consented to by the Fixed Asset
Security Agent (acting on behalf of the Majority First Lien Creditors prior to the First Lien Discharge Date, and, thereafter,
the Majority Second Lien Creditors) that meets comparable requirements as set forth above in this paragraph.

In an insolvency or liquidation proceeding in the U.S., the provision of any DIP Financing that is secured by liens
on Fixed Asset Collateral senior to or pari passu with the liens securing the First Lien Obligations or any consent to the use
of cash collateral constituting Fixed Asset Collateral under section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code shall require only the
consent of, prior to the First Lien Discharge Date, the Majority First Lien Creditors.

_Automatic Stay_

Until the ABL Facilities Discharge Date, the Fixed Asset Security Agent, on behalf of itself and the Fixed Asset
Creditors, agrees that none of them shall seek (or support any other person seeking) relief from the automatic stay or any
other stay in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding in respect of the ABL Collateral (including the Common ABL
Collateral), without the prior written consent of the ABL Security Agent. The ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL
Security Agent and the ABL Creditors will agree to similar limitations with respect to their right to seek relief from the
automatic stay in respect of any Fixed Asset Collateral.

_Sales_

Subject to certain other provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Fixed Asset Security Agent will consent
and will not object or oppose, or support any party in objecting to or opposing, a motion to dispose of any ABL Collateral
free and clear of any liens or other claims under Section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision of any
other applicable bankruptcy law), or any related motion to establish bidding procedures for such a sale or disposition, if
(i) the ABL Security Agent (without requiring any further consent of the Common ABL Security Agent as it relates to the
Common ABL Collateral) and the requisite ABL Creditors shall have consented to such sale or disposition of such ABL
Collateral, (ii) such motion does not impair, subject to the priorities set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, the rights of
the Fixed Asset Security Agent and the other Fixed Asset Creditors under Section 363(k) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or
any similar provision of any applicable bankruptcy law) (provided that the right of any Fixed Asset Creditor to offset its
claim against the purchase price for any ABL Collateral exists only after the ABL Facilities Discharge Date), and (iii) the


-----

terms of any proposed order approving such transaction provide for the liens of the Fixed Asset Security Agent and the
other Fixed Asset Creditors on the ABL Collateral to attach to the proceeds of the ABL Collateral that is the subject of
such disposition, subject to the lien priorities and the other terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement. The ABL
Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent and the other ABL Creditors will agree to similar limitations with
respect to their right to object to a sale or other disposition of any Fixed Asset Collateral (or any portion thereof).

_Adequate Protection_

None of the Fixed Asset Security Agent nor the other Fixed Asset Creditors shall contest (or support any other
person contesting) in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding (1) any request by the ABL Security Agent (or by the
Common ABL Security Agent at the direction of the ABL Security Agent prior to the ABL Facilities Discharge Date) or
the other ABL Creditors for adequate protection with respect to the ABL Collateral, provided (A) until last Discharge Date
to occur in respect of any of the Fixed Asset Obligations (the “Fixed Asset Discharge Date”) such request for adequate
protection shall not seek the creation of any lien over additional assets or property of any Debtor or Security Provider other
than with respect to assets or property that constitute ABL Collateral and (B) if such additional assets or property shall also
constitute Fixed Asset Collateral, (i) a lien shall have been created in favor of the Fixed Asset Security Agent in respect of
such Collateral and (ii) the lien thereon in favor of the ABL Creditors shall be subordinated to the extent set forth in the
Intercreditor Agreement, or (2) any objection by the ABL Security Agent (or by the Common ABL Security Agent at the
direction of the ABL Security Agent prior to the ABL Facilities Discharge Date) or other ABL Creditor to any motion,
relief, action or proceeding based on the ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent or other ABL Creditors
claiming a lack of adequate protection; provided that if the ABL Security Agent or Common ABL Security Agent is granted
adequate protection in the form of a lien on additional or replacement collateral, the Fixed Asset Security Agent and the
other Fixed Asset Creditors may seek or request adequate protection in the form of lien on such additional or replacement
collateral; it being understood and agreed that (1) if such additional or replacement collateral shall also constitute Fixed
Asset Collateral, the lien on such additional or replacement collateral in favor of the ABL Security Agent, the Common
ABL Security Agent and the other ABL Creditors shall be subordinate to all liens on such additional or replacement
collateral in favor of the Fixed Asset Security Agent and (2) if such additional or replacement collateral shall also constitute
ABL Collateral, the lien on such additional or replacement collateral in favor of the ABL Security Agent, the Common
ABL Security Agent and the other ABL Creditors shall be senior to all liens on such additional or replacement collateral
in favor of the Fixed Asset Security Agent. The ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent and the other ABL
Creditors will agree to similar limitations with respect to their right to contest any request of the Fixed Asset Security Agent
or the other Fixed Asset Creditors for adequate protection or any objection of the Fixed Asset Security Agent or the other
Fixed Asset Creditors to any motion, relief, action or proceeding for lack of adequate protection.

Except as otherwise expressly set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement or in connection with the exercise of
remedies with respect to (i) the ABL Collateral, nothing in the Intercreditor Agreement shall limit the rights of the Fixed
Asset Security Agent or the other Fixed Asset Creditors from seeking adequate protection with respect to their rights in the
Fixed Asset Collateral in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding (including adequate protection in the form of a cash
payment, periodic cash payments or otherwise, other than from proceeds of the ABL Collateral) or (ii) the Fixed Asset
Collateral, nothing in the Intercreditor Agreement shall limit the rights of the ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL
Security Agent or the other ABL Creditors from seeking adequate protection with respect to their rights in the ABL
Collateral in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding (including adequate protection in the form of a cash payment,
periodic cash payments or otherwise, other than from proceeds of the Fixed Asset Collateral).

_Post-petition Interest_

No Fixed Asset Security Agent nor any other Fixed Asset Creditor shall oppose or seek to challenge any claim by
the ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent or any other ABL Creditor for allowance in any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding of ABL Obligations consisting of interest, fees, expenses and other charges that, pursuant to the
ABL Documents, continue to accrue after the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, whether or not
such interest, fees, expenses and other charges are allowed or allowable under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or any other
applicable bankruptcy law) or in any such insolvency or liquidation proceeding, to the extent of the value of the lien
securing any ABL Creditor’s claim, without regard to the existence of the lien of the Fixed Asset Security Agent on behalf
of the Fixed Asset Creditors on the Collateral. The ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent and the other
ABL Creditors will agree to similar limitations with respect to their right to oppose or seek to challenge any comparable
claim by the Fixed Asset Security Agent or any other Fixed Asset Creditor for post-petition interest, fees, expenses and
other charges to the extent of the value of the lien securing any such Fixed Asset Creditor’s claim.

_Certain Waivers_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Fixed Asset Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the other
Fixed Asset Creditors, (i) waives any claim and objection it may have against any ABL Creditor arising out of the election
of any ABL Creditor of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision of any


-----

other applicable bankruptcy law) or out of any grant of a security interest in connection with the ABL Collateral in any
insolvency or liquidation proceeding (provided that any such grant of a security interest comports with the provisions of
the Intercreditor Agreement, including the provisions governing grant of security interests described under the headings
“—Financing Matters” and “—Adequate Protection” above); (ii) agrees that it will not assert or enforce any claim under
Section 506(c) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law) senior to or
on parity with the liens on the ABL Collateral securing the ABL Obligations; and (iii) agrees that it will not assert or
enforce any claim against any ABL Creditor under the “equities of the case” exception of Section 552(b) of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law). The ABL Security Agent, the Common
ABL Security Agent and the ABL Creditors will agree to waive similar claims and objections with respect to the actions
of any of the Fixed Asset Security Agent and any other Fixed Asset Creditors with respect to the Fixed Asset Collateral.

_Separate Grants of Security and Separate Classification_

The Fixed Asset Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the other Fixed Asset Creditors, and the ABL Security
Agent and the Common ABL Security Agent, each for itself and on behalf of the other ABL Creditors, acknowledge and
agree that the grants of liens pursuant to the ABL Security Documents, the Fixed Asset Security Documents in respect of
the First Lien Obligations and any future Fixed Asset Security Documents in respect of the Super Senior Obligations or
the Second Lien Obligations constitute separate and distinct grants of liens, and because of, among other things, their
differing rights in the Collateral, the Super Senior Obligations, the First Lien Obligations, the Second Lien Obligations and
the ABL Obligations are fundamentally different and must be separately classified in any plan of reorganization or similar
dispositive restructuring plan proposed, confirmed, or adopted in an insolvency or liquidation proceeding. In furtherance
of the foregoing, the Fixed Asset Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the other Fixed Asset Creditors, and the ABL
Security Agent and the Common ABL Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the other ABL Creditors, each agrees that
the Super Senior Creditors, the First Lien Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the ABL Creditors will vote as separate
classes in connection with any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan in any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding and that no Security Agent nor any Creditor will seek to vote with a Creditor of another class as a
single class in connection with any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan in any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding. To further effectuate the intent of the parties as provided in this paragraph, if it is held that the
claims of the Super Senior Creditors, the First Lien Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the ABL Creditors in respect
of the Collateral constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate classes of secured claims subject to the relative
lien priorities set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement), then the Fixed Asset Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the
Fixed Asset Creditors and the ABL Security Agent and the Common ABL Security Agent, each for itself and on behalf of
the ABL Creditors, will acknowledge and agree that, subject to certain other provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, all
distributions from the ABL Collateral shall be made as if there were separate classes of senior and junior secured claims
against the Debtors and/or Security Provider in respect of the ABL Collateral (with the effect being that, to the extent that
the aggregate value of the ABL Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all claims held by the Fixed Asset
Creditors), the ABL Creditors shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of principal,
pre-petition interest and other claims, all amounts owing in respect of post-petition interest, fees, expenses and other
charges, including any additional interest payable pursuant to the ABL Documents, arising from or related to a default,
whether or not a claim therefor is allowed as a claim in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding) before any distribution
from the ABL Collateral is made in respect of the claims held by the Fixed Asset Creditors, with each Fixed Asset Security
Agent, for itself and on behalf of the applicable Fixed Asset Creditors, acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to the
ABL Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the ABL Creditors, amounts otherwise received or receivable by them from
the ABL Collateral to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of
reducing the claim or recovery of the Fixed Asset Creditors). The ABL Security Agent and the Common ABL Security
Agent, each for itself and on behalf of the ABL Creditors and the Fixed Asset Security Agent (for itself and on behalf of
each class of Fixed Asset Creditors), acknowledge and agree to similar turnover provisions with respect to the Fixed Asset
Collateral.

The Fixed Asset Security Agent and the other Fixed Asset Creditors, on the one hand, and the ABL Security
Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent and the ABL Creditors, on the other hand, shall retain the right to vote and
otherwise act in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding (including the right to vote to accept or reject any plan of
reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan) to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement.

**_Turnover of Receipts_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, if at any time prior to the Final Discharge
Date, any Creditor receives or recovers (a) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the
Obligations which is not either (i) a payment permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement or (ii) made in accordance with
the applicable proceeds waterfall (as described in the section “—Application of Proceeds”); (b) other than where set-off
applies (in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement), any amount by way of set-off in respect of any of the Obligations
owed to it which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement; (c) notwithstanding


-----

clauses (a) and (b) above, and other than where set-off applies, any amount: (i) on account of, or in relation to, any of the
Obligations: (A) during the continuation of a Distress Event or an Enforcement Action or (B) as a result of any other
litigation or proceedings against a member of the Group (other than during the continuation of an insolvency event in
respect of such member of the Group); or (ii) by way of set-off in respect of any of the Obligations owed to it during the
continuation of a Distress Event or Enforcement Action; (d) the proceeds of any enforcement of any Fixed Asset Collateral
or ABL Collateral or the proceeds of any Distressed Disposal, in each case, except in accordance with the applicable
proceeds waterfall (as described in the section “—Application of Proceeds”); or (e) other than where set-off applies, any
distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the Obligations owed by any member
of the Group which is not in accordance with the applicable proceeds waterfall (as described in the section “—Application
of Proceeds”) and which is made as a result of, or after the occurrence of, an insolvency event in respect of such member
of the Group (provided that, in the case of receipt or recovery by holders of Existing Senior Secured Notes and Existing
Senior Notes or any Primary Creditor whose Obligations are in the form of notes or other debt securities outstanding,
clauses (c), (d) and (e) shall only apply to the extent that such distribution constitutes enforcement proceeds from
Collateral), that Creditor will (i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (A) hold
an amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant Obligations (or if less, the amount received or recovered) on
trust for (x) the ABL Security Agent (in the case of ABL Obligations, ABL Collateral, or amounts attributable to any of
the foregoing) and promptly pay that amount to the ABL Security Agent for application in accordance with the application
of proceeds waterfall described in the section “—Application of proceeds—ABL Collateral,” or (y) the Fixed Asset
Security Agent (in the case of Fixed Asset Obligations, Fixed Asset Collateral, or amounts attributable to any of the
foregoing) and promptly pay that amount to the Fixed Asset Security Agent for application in accordance with the
application of proceeds waterfall described in the section “—Application of proceeds—Fixed Asset Collateral,” and
(B) promptly pay an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant Obligations
to (x) the ABL Security Agent (in the case of ABL Obligations, ABL Collateral, or amounts attributable to any of the
foregoing) and promptly pay that amount to the ABL Security Agent for application in accordance with the application of
proceeds waterfall described in the section “—Application of proceeds—ABL Collateral,” or (y) the Fixed Asset Security
Agent (in the case of Fixed Asset Obligations, Fixed Asset Collateral, or amounts attributable to any of the foregoing) and
promptly pay that amount to the Fixed Asset Security Agent for application in accordance with the application of proceeds
waterfall described in the section “—Application of proceeds—Fixed Asset Collateral,” and (ii) in relation to receipts and
recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount equal to that recovery or receipt to (x) the
ABL Security Agent (in the case of ABL Obligations, ABL Collateral, or amounts attributable to any of the foregoing) and
promptly pay that amount to the ABL Security Agent for application in accordance with the application of proceeds
waterfall described in the section “—Application of proceeds—ABL Collateral,” or (y) the Fixed Asset Security Agent (in
the case of Fixed Asset Obligations, Fixed Asset Collateral, or amounts attributable to any of the foregoing) and promptly
pay that amount to the Fixed Asset Security Agent for application in accordance with the application of proceeds waterfall
described in the section “—Application of proceeds—Fixed Asset Collateral.”

The Intercreditor Agreement also includes certain customary loss sharing provisions.

**_Deferral of Subrogation_**

Under the Intercreditor Agreement:

(a) Subject to (c) below, if the Secured Obligations of any Creditor are wholly or partly paid out of any
proceeds received in respect of or on account of any Secured Obligations owing to one or more other
Creditors, that other Creditor will, to that extent, be subrogated to the Secured Obligations so paid (and
all securities and guarantees for those Secured Obligations).

(b) Subject to clause (c) below, to the extent that any Creditor (each a “Subrogated Creditor”) is entitled
to exercise rights of subrogation under clause (a) above, each other Creditor (subject in each case to it
being indemnified, secured or prefunded to its satisfaction against any resulting costs, expenses and
liabilities) will give such assistance to enable such rights to be so exercised as such Subrogated Creditor
may reasonably request.

(c) No Creditor, Debtor or Security Provider will exercise any rights which it may have by reason of the
performance by it of its obligations under the Debt Documents to take the benefit (in whole or in part
and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights under the Debt Documents of any Creditor
which ranks ahead of it in accordance with the priorities as described in the section “—Ranking and
priority” until such time as all of the Obligations owing to each prior ranking Creditor (or, in the case of
any Debtor or Security Provider prior to the Final Discharge Date) have been irrevocably paid in full or,
as it relates to the ABL Obligations, the ABL Discharge Date has occurred.


-----

(d) Subject to certain exceptions, no Subordinated Creditor will exercise any rights which it may have to
take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights under
the Debt Documents of any Creditor until the Final Discharge Date.

**_Enforcement of Security_**

_Manner of Enforcement—Fixed Asset Collateral_

Prior to the last Discharge Date in respect of the Super Senior Obligations (the “Super Senior Discharge Date”),
the Fixed Asset Security Agent, and prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date and after the ABL Facilities Discharge Date,
the Common ABL Security Agent, will (subject as further set out below and other than in certain limited circumstances
specified in the Intercreditor Agreement where the Fixed Asset Security Agent will act on the instructions of the Majority
Second Lien Creditors) act on the instructions as to Enforcement of (i) the Majority Super Senior Creditors and (ii) unless
the First Lien Discharge Date has occurred, the Majority First Lien Creditors, in each case subject to the consultation period
referred to below and provided that such instructions are consistent with the security enforcement principles set forth below.
Following the Super Senior Discharge Date but prior to the First Lien Discharge Date, the Fixed Asset Security Agent, and
following the Super Senior Discharge Date and the ABL Facilities Discharge Date but prior to the First Lien Discharge
Date, the Common ABL Security Agent, will act on the instructions as to Enforcement of the Majority First Lien Creditors
(other than in certain limited circumstances specified in the Intercreditor Agreement where the Fixed Asset Security Agent
will act on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors). Following the First Lien Discharge Date but prior to
the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Fixed Asset Security Agent, and following the First Lien Discharge Date and the
ABL Facilities Discharge Date but prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Common ABL Security Agent, will act
on the instructions as to Enforcement of the (i) Majority Super Senior Creditors and (ii) unless the Second Lien Discharge
Date has occurred, the Majority Second Lien Creditors (other than in certain limited circumstances specified in the
Intercreditor Agreement where the Fixed Asset Security Agent will act on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien
Creditors). Following the later of the Super Senior Discharge Date and the First Lien Discharge Date, the Fixed Asset
Security Agent, and following the later of (i) the later of the Super Senior Discharge Date and ABL Facilities Discharge
Date, and (ii) the later of the First Lien Discharge Date and the ABL Facilities Discharge Date, the Common ABL Security
Agent, will act on the instructions as to Enforcement of the Majority Second Lien Creditors. Following the Fixed Asset
Discharge Date in the event the ABL Facilities Discharge Date has not occurred, the Fixed Asset Security Agent and
Common ABL Security Agent will act on the instructions of the ABL Agent or the ABL Security Agent. In each of the
scenarios outlined in this paragraph, the relevant parties giving instructions to the Fixed Asset Security Agent shall be the
“Instructing Group.”

_Consultation_

Prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date and prior to giving any instructions to the Fixed Asset Security Agent
to commence enforcement of all or part of the Fixed Asset Collateral and/or the requesting of a distressed disposal and/or
the release or disposal of claims or Fixed Asset Collateral on a distressed disposal, and the taking of any other actions
consequential on (or necessary to effect) the enforcement of the Fixed Asset Collateral (“Enforcement”), the Representative
of the largest aggregate principal amount of the First Lien Obligations (or, to the extent that the Second Lien Creditors are
permitted to do so, the Representative of the largest aggregate principal amount of the Second Lien Obligations) or the
agent under any Super Senior RCF Debt (the “Super Senior Agent”) (if there is a Super Senior Agent), as the case may be,
shall notify the Fixed Asset Security Agent that the applicable Fixed Asset Collateral has become enforceable and
requesting the Fixed Asset Security Agent to solicit instructions to enforce the Fixed Asset Collateral or take other
Enforcement Action. As soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of such a notice, the Fixed Asset Security Agent, shall
distribute such notice to the relevant addressees promptly upon receipt, following which, the Super Senior Agent (if there
is a Super Senior Agent), the Super Senior Hedge Counterparties, the First Lien Notes Trustee and the Representative(s)
of any other First Lien Debt will consult in good faith with each other and the Fixed Asset Security Agent for a period of
15 days from the date such notice is received by such persons (or such shorter period as the relevant parties may agree)
with a view to coordinating the instructions to be given by an Instructing Group and agreeing an enforcement strategy (the
“Consultation Period”).

No such consultation shall be required (and an Instructing Group shall be entitled to give any instructions to the
Fixed Asset Security Agent to enforce the Fixed Asset Collateral or take any other Enforcement Action prior to the end of
the Consultation Period, in each case provided such instructions comply with the Security Enforcement Principles set forth
below (“Qualifying Instructions”)) where:

(a) any of the Fixed Asset Collateral has become enforceable as a result of an insolvency event affecting any
Debtor or Security Provider; or

(b) the Instructing Group or, as applicable, the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority First Lien
Creditors or Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) determine in good faith (and notifies each


-----

other Representative of the other Secured Creditors, each Hedge Counterparty, each Cash Management
Provider and the Fixed Asset Security Agent) that any delay caused by such consultation could
reasonably be expected (A) to reduce the amount likely to be realized to a level such that (following
application in accordance with the application of proceeds waterfall described in the section “—
Application of proceeds—Fixed Asset Collateral”) the payments then due and payable to the Super
Senior Creditors would not be discharged in full or (B) to have a material adverse effect on the ability to
effect an Enforcement or a Distressed Disposal and, in each case any instructions will be limited to those
necessary to protect or preserve the interests of the Creditors, on behalf of which the relevant Instructing
Group is acting and the Fixed Asset Security Agent shall act in accordance with the instructions first
received.

If following the Consultation Period, the Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority First Lien Creditors
and/or Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) have agreed on an enforcement strategy, the Fixed Asset Security
Agent, shall be instructed to implement the same.

Subject to the paragraph below, in the event that conflicting instructions (and for these purposes silence is deemed
to be a conflicting instruction) are received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority First Lien Creditors
or Majority Second Lien Creditors by the end of the Consultation Period (which have not be resolved), the Fixed Asset
Security Agent shall enforce the Fixed Asset Collateral and/or refrain from enforcing the Fixed Asset Collateral and/or
take the relevant other Enforcement Action in accordance with the instructions provided by the Majority First Lien
Creditors (or, to the extent that the Second Lien Creditors are permitted to do so, the Majority Second Lien Creditors) in
each case provided such instructions are Qualifying Instructions and the terms of all instructions received by the Fixed
Asset Security Agent during the Consultation Period shall be deemed revoked.

If prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date:

(a) the Super Senior Obligations have not been repaid in full in cash within six months of the end of the
Consultation Period (or within six months of the event of default giving rise to the right to commence an
Enforcement if no such Consultation Period is required);

(b) the Fixed Asset Security Agent has not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other
Enforcement Action within three months of the end of the Consultation Period (or within three months
of the event of default giving rise to the right to commence an Enforcement if no such Consultation
Period is required); or

(c) an insolvency event has occurred with respect to a Debtor or Security Provider and the Fixed Asset
Security Agent has not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other Enforcement
Action at that time with respect to such Debtor or Security Provider (as applicable),

then the Fixed Asset Security Agent shall thereafter follow any instructions that are subsequently given by (A) prior to the
Super Senior Discharge Date in respect of the Super Senior RCF Obligations, the Majority Super Senior Creditors or (B)
thereafter the Majority Super Senior/First Lien Creditors (in each case provided the same are Qualifying Instructions and
the Fixed Asset Security Agent shall be entitled to assume that any instructions for enforcement given to it are Qualifying
Instructions) to the exclusion of those given by the Majority First Lien Creditors or the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as
applicable) to the extent conflicting with any instructions previously given by the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the
Majority Super Senior/First Lien Creditors (as applicable).

_Security Enforcement Principles_

Unless otherwise provided in the Intercreditor Agreement, until the Fixed Asset Discharge Date, enforcement of
the Fixed Asset Collateral must be conducted in accordance with the “Security Enforcement Principles,” which are
summarized as follows:

(a) It shall be the priority and overriding aim of any enforcement of the Fixed Asset Collateral to maximize,
so far as is consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value from enforcement of the Fixed
Asset Collateral, and in a manner consistent with the Intercreditor Agreement, the recovery by the Fixed
Asset Creditors (the “Security Enforcement Objective”) subject to applicable law.

(b) The Security Enforcement Principles may be amended, varied or waived with the prior written consent
of (i) while no Super Senior RCF is outstanding, the Majority Super Senior/First Lien Creditors and (ii)
while a Super Senior RCF is outstanding, (A) the Majority Super Senior Creditors; (B) the First Lien
Notes Trustee and (C) any other Representative of First Lien Obligations and (to the extent relating to


-----

the definition of “Security Enforcement Objective” or paragraph (a) above) the Majority Second Lien
Creditors.

(c) Without prejudice to the Security Enforcement Objective, the Fixed Asset Collateral will, subject to
applicable law, be enforced and other action as to Enforcement will be taken such that either (1) all
proceeds of Enforcement are received by the Fixed Asset Security Agent in cash (or substantially all
cash) for distribution in accordance with the application of proceeds waterfall described in the section
“—Application of proceeds—Fixed Asset Collateral”; or (2) sufficient proceeds of Enforcement will be
received by the Fixed Asset Security Agent in cash to ensure that when the proceeds are applied in
accordance with the application of proceeds waterfall described in the section “—Application of
proceeds—Fixed Asset Collateral,” the Super Senior Obligations are repaid and discharged in full (unless
the Majority Super Senior Creditors agree otherwise).

(d) On (i) a proposed Enforcement of any of the Fixed Asset Collateral other than shares in a member of the
Group, where the aggregate book value of such assets exceeds $5,000,000 (or its equivalent); or (ii) a
proposed Enforcement of any Fixed Asset Collateral consisting of some or all of the shares in a member
of the Group, the Fixed Asset Security Agent shall (unless such enforcement or sale is made pursuant to
a public auction, a public offering or process supervised by a court of law which makes a determination
as to value) obtain an opinion from a reputable internationally recognized investment bank or
international accounting firm or other reputable, third-party professional firm that is regularly engaged
in providing valuations of businesses or assets similar or comparable to such Fixed Asset Collateral to
be enforced (a “Financial Advisor”) to opine as expert (A) on the optimal method of enforcing the Fixed
Asset Collateral so as to achieve the Security Enforcement Objective and maximize recovery, (B) that
the proceeds received from enforcement is fair from a financial point of view after taking into account
all relevant circumstances, and (C) that such sale is otherwise in accordance with the Security
Enforcement Principles, provided that the provider of such opinion may limit its liability in respect of
such opinion to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement.

(e) The Fixed Asset Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Advisor or to seek
the advice of a Financial Advisor, unless expressly required to do so by the Intercreditor Agreement.

_Enforcement Through Fixed Asset Security Agent Only_

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, until the Fixed Asset Discharge Date the Secured Creditors shall have no
independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Fixed Asset Collateral or to exercise any right, power,
authority or discretion arising under the Fixed Asset Security Documents except through the Fixed Asset Security Agent.

_Alternative Enforcement Actions_

After the Fixed Asset Security Agent has commenced enforcement, it shall not accept any subsequent instructions
as to enforcement from anyone other than the relevant Instructing Group regarding any other enforcement of the Fixed
Asset Collateral over or relating to shares or assets directly or indirectly the subject of the Enforcement of the Fixed Asset
Collateral which has been commenced. The provisions of this section shall apply to the Common ABL Security Agent after
the ABL Facilities Discharge Date.

_Manner of Enforcement—ABL Collateral_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, until the ABL Facilities Discharge Date, the ABL Security Agent, the
Common ABL Security Agent and the other ABL Creditors shall have the right subject to the below to enforce rights,
exercise remedies (including setoff, recoupment and the right to credit bid their debt) and, in connection therewith
(including voluntary dispositions of ABL Collateral by the respective Debtor or Security Provider after an event of default
under the ABL Credit Agreement), make determinations regarding the release, disposition, or restrictions with respect to
the ABL Collateral (including, without limitation, exercising remedies under any control agreements and dominion
accounts), without any consultation with or the consent of the Fixed Asset Security Agent or any Fixed Asset Creditor;
_provided, however, that the liens securing Fixed Asset Obligations (x) shall remain on the proceeds (other than any_
proceeds properly applied to the ABL Obligations) of any ABL Collateral released or disposed of, subject to the relative
priorities set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement and (y) shall be released in the case of any release of liens by the ABL
Security Agent or the Common ABL Security Agent on ABL Collateral in accordance with the terms under the heading
“—Release of Liens” below.

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that until the ABL Facilities Discharge Date, whether or not any
insolvency or liquidation proceeding has been commenced by or against any Debtor or Security Provider neither the Fixed
Asset Security Agent or any other Fixed Asset Creditor will (a) exercise or seek to exercise (and instead shall be deemed


-----

to have irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally waived, but solely to the extent necessary to further the purpose of this
section) any rights, powers or remedies with respect to the ABL Collateral, or (b) commence or join with any person (in
each case other than the ABL Agent, the ABL Security Agent and the Common ABL Security Agent) in commencing, or
filing a petition for, any insolvency or liquidation proceeding against any Debtor or Security Provider, in the case of
clauses (a) and (b), at any time prior to the passage of a period of at least 180 days has elapsed (subject to the tolling of
such period as described in clause (x) below) since the later of: (A) the date on which the Fixed Asset Security Agent
declared the existence of an event of default under any Debt Document governing Fixed Asset Obligations and demanded
the repayment of all of the principal amount of any Fixed Asset Obligations and (B) the date on which the ABL Security
Agent received notice from the Fixed Asset Security Agent of such declaration of such a default and such demand for
repayment (the “Fixed Asset Standstill Period”); (x) if any of the ABL Security Agent or the other ABL Creditors are
stayed or otherwise prohibited from commencing and continuing to exercise any Enforcement Action or to liquidate or sell
any ABL Collateral by operation of law, court order or otherwise, then the 180-day period shall be tolled during the
pendency of such stay or other prohibition, plus an additional number of days such that the Fixed Asset Standstill Period
extends at least 45 days after the applicable stay or other prohibition on enforcement are no longer in effect; and
(y) notwithstanding anything in the Intercreditor Agreement to the contrary, in no event will the Fixed Asset Security Agent
or any other Fixed Asset Creditor exercise any rights or remedies with respect to the ABL Collateral if, notwithstanding
the expiration of the Fixed Asset Standstill Period, the ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent or any ABL
Creditor shall have commenced and are diligently pursuing the exercise of their rights or remedies with respect to all or
any material portion of the ABL Collateral (prompt notice of such exercise to be given to the Fixed Asset Security Agent).

On or promptly following the ABL Facilities Discharge Date, to the extent permitted by applicable law (unless
any other person has made a demand therefor and is lawfully entitled thereto or unless a court of competent jurisdiction
otherwise directs), if the Fixed Asset Discharge Date has not occurred, the ABL Security Agent shall, without recourse or
warranty, take commercially reasonable steps to deliver to the Fixed Asset Security Agent any Collateral and proceeds of
Collateral held by it as a result of the exercise of remedies in the same form as received, with any necessary endorsements
or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct to be applied by the Fixed Asset Security Agent to the Fixed
Asset Obligations; it being understood that any security interest in deposit accounts, securities accounts or commodities
accounts in favor of the Fixed Asset Obligations may no longer exist upon the ABL Facilities Discharge Date, and the ABL
Security Agent shall not be required to take any action in connection with such accounts or any assets deposited therein or
credited thereto. Similar terms shall apply, following the Fixed Asset Discharge Date, to the Fixed Asset Security Agent.

_Permitted Actions_

Notwithstanding the provisions described in this section “—Enforcement of security” or any restrictions on
Creditors undertaking any Enforcement Action, each Security Agent and any Creditor of any class may (i) file a claim or
statement of interest with respect to the Obligations of such class, provided that an insolvency or liquidation proceeding
has been commenced by or against any Debtor or Security Provider, (ii) take any action in order to create, perfect, preserve
or protect its lien on any of the Collateral; _provided that such action shall not be inconsistent with the terms of the_
Intercreditor Agreement and shall not be adverse to the priority status of the liens of the Security Agents on the Collateral,
or the rights of the Security Agents or the other Creditors to exercise remedies in respect thereof as permitted by the
Intercreditor Agreement, (iii) file any necessary or appropriate responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any
motion, claim, adversary proceeding or other pleading made by any person objecting to or otherwise seeking the
disallowance of its claims or liens, in each case in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, (iv) file any pleadings,
objections, motions or agreements that assert rights or interests available to unsecured creditors of any Debtor or Security
Provider arising under either any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or applicable non-bankruptcy law, in each case not
inconsistent with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, (v) vote on any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive
restructuring plan, file any proof of claim, make other filings and make any arguments and motions that are, in each case,
in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (subject to the proviso in clause (ii) above), or (vi) exercise
any of its other rights or remedies with respect to any of the Collateral to the extent permitted by the Intercreditor
Agreement.

_Entry Upon Premises by ABL Security Agent and ABL Creditors_

If the Fixed Asset Security Agent, or any agent, representative or affiliate of the Fixed Asset Security Agent, any
Fixed Asset Creditor or any receiver, shall obtain possession or physical control of any real properties subject to a Fixed
Asset Security Document that constitute Fixed Asset Collateral or any material portion of the tangible Fixed Asset
Collateral located on any premises other than real properties subject to a Fixed Asset Security Document, the Fixed Asset
Security Agent shall promptly notify the ABL Security Agent in writing of that fact (such notice, a “Notice of Occupancy”)
and the ABL Security Agent shall, within thirty (30) days thereafter, notify the Fixed Asset Security Agent in writing if
and when the ABL Security Agent and the Common ABL Security Agent desire to exercise its access rights as outlined in
this section (such rights, the “ABL Access Rights”). Upon delivery of such notice by the ABL Security Agent to the Fixed
Asset Security Agent, the parties shall confer in good faith to coordinate with respect to the ABL Security Agent’s and the
Common ABL Security Agent’s exercise of such access rights; provided, that it is understood and agreed that the Fixed


-----

Asset Security Agent shall obtain possession or physical control of such real properties in the manner provided in the
applicable Fixed Asset Security Documents and in the manner provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. Access rights may
apply to differing parcels of real property at differing times, in which case, a differing Access Period may apply to each
such property. “Access Period” means the period, with respect to any Fixed Asset Collateral, which begins on the day that
the ABL Security Agent provides the Fixed Asset Security Agent with the notice of its election to exercise its ABL Access
Rights with respect to such Fixed Asset Collateral and ends on the earliest of (i) the 180th day after the date that the ABL
Security Agent and the Common ABL Security Agent obtain the ability to use, take physical possession of, remove or
otherwise control the use or access to such Fixed Asset Collateral plus such number of days, if any, after the ABL Security
Agent and the Common ABL Security Agent obtain access to such Collateral that it is stayed or otherwise prohibited by
law or court order from exercising remedies with respect to Collateral located on such property such that such Access
Period extends at least 45 days after the applicable stay or other prohibition on enforcement are no longer in effect, (ii) the
date on which all or substantially all of the ABL Collateral located on such property is sold, collected or liquidated, (iii) the
ABL Facilities Discharge Date and (iv) the date on which the event of default that gave rise to such enforcement actions
by the ABL Security Agent and the Common ABL Security Agent has been cured or waived.

During any such Access Period, the ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent (with respect to the
Common ABL Collateral and at the direction of the ABL Security Agent), and their respective employees, agents, advisors,
representatives and designees (and persons employed on their respective behalves), may continue to operate, service,
maintain, process and sell the ABL Collateral, including by public auction, private sale or a “store closing”, going out of
business sale or similar sale, whether in bulk, in lots or to customers in the ordinary course of business or otherwise and
which sale may include augmented inventory of the same type sold in any Debtor’s (or Security Provider’s) business. The
ABL Security Agent (and the Common ABL Security Agent, with respect to the Common ABL Collateral) shall take
proper care of any Fixed Asset Collateral that is used by the ABL Security Agent or the Common ABL Security Agent, as
applicable, during the Access Period and, subject to the protections and immunities of the ABL Security Agent and the
Common ABL Security Agent contained in the Intercreditor Agreement, shall procure the repair and replacement of any
damage (ordinary wear-and-tear excepted) to the Fixed Asset Collateral directly caused by the ABL Security Agent, the
Common ABL Security Agent or their respective employees, agents, advisors, representatives or designees and the ABL
Security Agent (and the Common ABL Security Agent, with respect to the Common ABL Collateral) shall comply in all
material respects with all applicable laws (and the ABL Security Agent and the Common ABL Security Agent may rely
on advice received by legal counsel in connection therewith) in connection with its use or occupancy of the Fixed Asset
Collateral. The ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent and the other ABL Creditors shall (only and solely
to the extent that there are sufficient available proceeds of ABL Collateral, that ABL Creditors (other than the ABL Security
Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent and the ABL Agent) have or are entitled to receive, for the purposes of paying
such indemnity) indemnify and hold harmless the Fixed Asset Security Agent and the other Fixed Asset Creditors for any
injury or damage to persons or property (ordinary wear-and-tear excepted) caused by the acts or omissions of the ABL
Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent or their respective employees, agents, advisors, representatives or
designees; provided that the ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent and the other ABL Creditors shall
not be liable for any diminution in the value of the Fixed Asset Collateral caused by the absence or removal of the ABL
Collateral therefrom. In no event shall the ABL Creditors, the ABL Security Agent or the Common ABL Security Agent
have any liability to the Fixed Asset Creditors and/or to the Fixed Asset Security Agent as a result of (i) any environmental
condition, claim, damage, loss or liability existing prior to or after the date of exercise by the ABL Security Agent or the
Common ABL Security Agent of its ABL Access Rights with respect to that Fixed Asset Collateral, except as may be
directly caused by the ABL Security Agent or the Common ABL Security Agent, or (ii) any condition, claim, damage, loss
or liability on or with respect to the Fixed Asset Collateral (x) existing prior to the date of the exercise by the ABL Security
Agent or the Common ABL Security Agent of its ABL Access Rights with respect to such Fixed Asset Collateral or (y) not
directly caused by or resulting from the actions taken or not taken by the ABL Security Agent or the Common ABL Security
Agent. The ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent and the Fixed Asset Security Agent shall cooperate
and use reasonable efforts to ensure that their activities during the Access Period as described above do not interfere
materially with the activities of the other as described above, including the right of the Fixed Asset Security Agent to show
the Fixed Asset Collateral to prospective purchasers and to ready the Fixed Asset Collateral for sale. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no circumstance whatsoever in connection with the ABL Security Agent’s or the Common ABL Security
Agent’s activities as described above shall the ABL Security Agent or the Common ABL Security Agent (i) be required to
expend its own funds in indemnifying any party or repairing or replacing (or the procurement thereof) of any damage to
any Fixed Asset Collateral, or (ii) be liable to any party for any repair, condition, claim, damage, loss or injury in respect
of the Fixed Asset Collateral; provided the ABL Security Agent or the Common ABL Security Agent, as applicable, is
acting without gross negligence or willful misconduct.

In the event that the ABL Security Agent or the Common ABL Security Agent elects to exercise its access rights
as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement, the Fixed Asset Security Agent agrees, for itself and on behalf of the other
Fixed Asset Creditors, that in the event that the Fixed Asset Security Agent exercises its rights to sell or otherwise dispose
of any real property, whether before or after the delivery of a Notice of Occupancy to the ABL Security Agent and the
Common ABL Security Agent, the Fixed Asset Security Agent shall (i) provide access rights to the ABL Security Agent
and the Common ABL Security Agent for the duration of the Access Period in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement


-----

and (ii) if such a sale or other disposition occurs prior to the ABL Security Agent delivering its notice of its desire to
exercise its and the Common ABL Security Agent’s ABL Access Rights during the time period provided therefor, or if
applicable, the expiration of the applicable Access Period, shall ensure that the purchaser or other transferee of such real
property provides the ABL Security Agent and the Common ABL Security Agent the opportunity to exercise its access
rights, and upon delivery of such a notice to such purchaser or transferee, continued access rights to the ABL Collateral for
the duration of the applicable Access Period, in the manner and to the extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement.

_No Interference; Reinstatement; Tracing of Proceeds_

Each Fixed Asset Creditor agrees that, prior to the ABL Discharge Date, whether or not any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding has been commenced by or against any Debtor or Security Provider:

(i) it will not (and it hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right to), directly or indirectly
(including by joining or directing any other Person to), contest, or support any other person in contesting,
in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the extent, attachment,
perfection, priority, validity or enforceability of a lien held, or allowability of any claims asserted, by or
on behalf of any of the ABL Creditors in the Collateral (or the extent, attachment, perfection, priority,
validity, enforceability or allowability of any ABL Security Document or any ABL Obligations secured
thereby or purported to be secured thereby), or the provisions or enforceability of the Intercreditor
Agreement; provided that nothing in the Intercreditor Agreement will be construed to prevent or impair
the rights of the Fixed Asset Security Agent to enforce the Intercreditor Agreement;

(ii) it will not (and it hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right to), directly or indirectly
(including by joining or directing any other Person to), contest, protest or object to, or otherwise interfere
with, any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL
Security Agent or any other ABL Creditor or any other exercise by the ABL Security Agent or any other
ABL Creditor of any rights and remedies relating to the ABL Collateral, whether under the ABL
Documents or otherwise;

(iii) it will not (and it hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right to), directly or indirectly
(including by joining or directing any other Person to), object to the forbearance by the ABL Security
Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent or any other ABL Creditor from bringing or pursuing any
collateral enforcement action or any other proceeding, action, or the exercise of any right or remedy
relating to the ABL Collateral; and

(iv) it will not assert, and it waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right to demand, request, plead
or otherwise assert or otherwise claim the benefit of, any marshalling, appraisal, valuation or other similar
right that may otherwise be available under applicable law with respect to the ABL Collateral or any
other similar rights a junior secured creditor or unsecured creditor may have under applicable law.

Each ABL Creditor will agree to similar limitations to those described in clauses (i) through (iv) above with
respect to their rights in the Fixed Asset Collateral and their ability to bring a suit against the Fixed Asset Security Agent
or the other Fixed Asset Creditors.

To the extent any payment with respect to any ABL Obligation is rescinded for any reason whatsoever or declared
to be or avoided as a fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, or a preference in any respect, set aside or required to be
turned over or otherwise paid to a debtor in possession or trustee in bankruptcy (a “Recovery”), any Fixed Asset Creditor,
receiver or similar person, whether in connection with any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or otherwise, then the
obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall, for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement and the
rights and obligations of the ABL Creditors and the Fixed Asset Creditors, be deemed to be reinstated and outstanding as
if such payment had not occurred. If the Intercreditor Agreement is terminated prior to such Recovery, the Intercreditor
Agreement shall be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior termination shall not diminish, release, discharge,
impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the parties thereto from such date of reinstatement. To the extent that any
interest, fees, expenses or other charges (including, without limitation, post-petition interest and all amounts accruing on
or after the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding relating to any Debtor or Security Provider, or that
would have accrued or become due under the terms of the ABL Documents but for the effect of the insolvency or liquidation
proceeding) to be paid pursuant to the ABL Documents are disallowed by order of any court, such interest, fees, expenses
and charges shall, as between the ABL Creditors and the Fixed Asset Creditors, be deemed to continue to accrue and be
added to the amount to be calculated as the “ABL Obligations.” The ABL Creditors will be subject to similar limitations
with respect to the Fixed Asset Collateral and any proceeds or payments in respect of any Fixed Asset Collateral.

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that prior to an issuance of a notice of enforcement of remedies by a
Security Agent or any other Secured Creditor, (i) all funds deposited in an account subject to a control agreement or


-----

dominion account that constitutes ABL Collateral and then applied to the ABL Obligations shall be treated as ABL
Collateral and, unless the ABL Security Agent has actual knowledge to the contrary, any claim that payments made to the
ABL Security Agent through the deposit accounts and securities accounts that are subject to such control agreements or
dominion accounts, respectively are proceeds of or otherwise constitute Fixed Asset Collateral are waived by the Fixed
Asset Creditors, (ii) all funds deposited in any account not forming a part of the ABL Collateral and then applied to the
Fixed Asset Obligations shall be treated as Fixed Asset Collateral and, unless the Fixed Asset Security Agent has actual
knowledge to the contrary, any claim that payments made to the Fixed Asset Security Agent through such account are
proceeds of or otherwise constitute ABL Collateral are waived by the ABL Creditors, and (iii) any proceeds of Collateral,
whether or not deposited in an account subject to a control agreement or a securities account control agreement, shall not
(as between the Security Agents, the ABL Creditors and the Fixed Asset Creditors) be treated as proceeds of Collateral for
purposes of determining the relative priorities in the Collateral.

The ABL Creditors agree that the Fixed Asset Creditors and the Fixed Asset Security Agent have no duty to the
ABL Creditors in respect of the maintenance or preservation of the Fixed Asset Collateral, the ABL Collateral, the Fixed
Asset Obligations, or otherwise. The Fixed Asset Creditors agree that the ABL Creditors and the ABL Security Agent have
no duty to the Fixed Asset Creditors in respect of the maintenance or preservation of the ABL Collateral, Fixed Asset
Collateral, the ABL Obligations, or otherwise.

_Consent to License to Use Property_

Without limiting any rights any of the ABL Creditors may otherwise have under applicable law or by agreement
and whether or not the Fixed Asset Security Agent has commenced and is continuing to undertake any Enforcement Action
or is otherwise exercising any rights, powers or remedies with respect to the Collateral, the Fixed Asset Security Agent,
the Debtors and the Security Providers will grant under the Intercreditor Agreement (to the full extent of their respective
rights and interests) to the ABL Security Agent and the Common ABL Security Agent an irrevocable, non-exclusive
worldwide right to have access to, and a worldwide, royalty-free (and also free of any other obligation of payment),
non-exclusive license (or, as applicable, sublicense, to the extent permitted without requiring payment to any third party or
obtaining any consent or waiver of any third party) and right to use the Fixed Asset Collateral, including, without limitation,
intellectual property, intellectual property rights, general intangibles and real property and equipment, processors,
computers and other machinery related to the storage or processing of records, documents or files, (i) to access the ABL
Collateral and (ii) to assemble, inspect, copy or download information stored on, take actions to perfect its lien on, process
raw materials or work-in-process into finished inventory, take possession of, move, package, prepare and advertise for sale
or disposition, sell (by public auction, private sale or a “going out of business” or similar sale, whether in bulk, in lots or
to customers in the ordinary course of business or otherwise and which sale may include augmented inventory of the same
type sold in Debtors’ (or Security Provider’s) business), store, collect, take reasonable actions to protect, secure and
otherwise enforce the rights of ABL Security Agent in and to the ABL Collateral (and of the Common ABL Security Agent
in and to the Common ABL Collateral), or otherwise deal with the ABL Collateral, in each case without the involvement
of or interference by any of the Fixed Asset Creditors, including in connection with any Enforcement Action commenced
by, or the exercising of any rights, powers or remedies with respect to the ABL Collateral by, the ABL Security Agent or
the Common ABL Security Agent, or in connection with the sale or other disposition of, or collection on, such ABL
Collateral during the continuance of an event of default under the ABL Credit Agreement that is consented to in writing
by the ABL Security Agent or the Common ABL Security Agent (at the direction of the ABL Security Agent), as applicable.

_Release of Liens_

If in connection with a Disposition (as defined below), any other sale, transfer or other disposition of ABL
Collateral (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Common ABL Collateral) pursuant to the terms of the ABL Documents,
the designation of “Excluded Accounts Receivable” (or equivalent term) pursuant to the terms of the ABL Documents, the
exercise of the ABL Security Agent’s or the Common ABL Security Agent’s remedies in respect of any ABL Collateral
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Common ABL Collateral), or in connection with the sale or other disposition
of, or collection on, such ABL Collateral (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Common ABL Collateral) during the
continuance of an event of default under the ABL Credit Agreement that is consented to in writing by the ABL Security
Agent (or by the Common ABL Security Agent at the direction of the ABL Security Agent), the ABL Security Agent or
the Common ABL Security Agent (at the direction of the ABL Security Agent), each for itself or on behalf of any ABL
Creditor releases any of its liens on any part of the ABL Collateral (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Common ABL
Collateral), then the liens, if any, of the Fixed Asset Security Agent, for itself or for the benefit of the other Fixed Asset
Creditors, on such ABL Collateral (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Common ABL Collateral) subject to such
transaction, will be automatically, unconditionally and simultaneously released. The Fixed Asset Security Agent shall
execute and deliver to the ABL Security Agent such termination statements, releases and other documents as the ABL
Security Agent may reasonably request to effectively confirm such release.

The ABL Security Agent, for itself or for the benefit of the other ABL Creditors, agrees to a similar automatic,
unconditional and simultaneous release of its liens on the Fixed Asset Collateral under comparable circumstances provided


-----

that, in the case of any such transaction directly or indirectly involving equity interests of any subsidiary of the Company
that is, or directly or indirectly owns, a Debtor or Security Provider a portion of whose assets consist of ABL Collateral,
(i) the Debtors or Security Providers shall have complied with the terms of the ABL Documents prior to such release,
including the repayment (or assumption by another borrower) of any ABL Obligations required to be paid (or assumed)
under the ABL Documents as a result of such transaction and (ii) such release shall be in accordance with terms set forth
below the heading “—Application of Proceeds and Releases Involving a Combination of ABL Collateral and Fixed Asset
Collateral.” The ABL Security Agent shall execute and deliver to the Fixed Asset Security Agent such termination
statements, releases and other documents as the Fixed Asset Security Agent may reasonably request to effectively confirm
such release.

_Application of Proceeds and Releases Involving a Combination of ABL Collateral and Fixed Asset Collateral_

Notwithstanding anything contained in this description or the Intercreditor Agreement to the contrary:

(a) in the event that any proceeds of Collateral received in connection with any (w) Enforcement Action,
(x) Distressed Disposal, (y) Non-Distressed Disposal, or (z) other sale, transfer or disposition by or on
behalf or at the direction of the Fixed Asset Security Agent or any other Fixed Asset Creditor (any such
event under clauses (x) through (z), a “Disposition”) involving a Debtor or Security Provider involves a
combination of ABL Collateral and Fixed Asset Collateral or any Enforcement Action or Disposition
involving equity interests of any subsidiary of the Company that is, or directly or indirectly owns, a
Debtor or Security Provider a portion of whose assets consist of ABL Collateral (whether or not other
Fixed Asset Collateral or ABL Collateral is directly involved in such Enforcement Action or
Disposition), then, for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement and unless otherwise expressly agreed
to by the ABL Agent and the Instructing Group in writing with respect to the applicable Enforcement
Action or Disposition, (x) a portion of such proceeds shall first be allocated to the ABL Collateral in an
amount equal to the sum of (i) the book value, as determined in accordance with IFRS (but not less than
cost), of any ABL Collateral consisting of inventory that is directly or indirectly the subject of such
Enforcement Action or Disposition (including any inventory owned by a Debtor or Security Provider the
equity interests of which are directly or indirectly the subject of such Enforcement Action or Disposition),
determined as of the date of such Enforcement Action or Disposition, (ii) the book value, as determined
in accordance with IFRS, of any ABL Collateral consisting of accounts or other accounts receivables that
are the subject of the Enforcement Action or Disposition (including any accounts or other accounts
receivables owned by a Debtor or Security Provider the equity interests of which are directly or indirectly
the subject of such Enforcement Action or Disposition) which results in such proceeds, determined as of
the date of such Enforcement Action or Disposition, and (iii) the fair market value, as determined in
accordance with IFRS, of all other ABL Collateral that is the subject of such Enforcement Action or
Disposition (including any other ABL Collateral owned by a Debtor or Security Provider the equity
interests of which are directly or indirectly the subject of such Enforcement Action or Disposition),
determined as of the date of such Enforcement Action or Disposition, and (y) any proceeds not allocated
under clause (x) to the ABL Collateral shall be allocated to the Fixed Asset Collateral; and

(b) the liens and security interests granted to the ABL Creditors in respect of the Collateral subject to any
transaction described in clause (a) above shall not be, and shall not be required to be, released by the
ABL Creditors unless the Debtors or Security Providers (as applicable) shall have complied with the
terms of the ABL Documents prior to such release and (other than any Non-Distressed Disposal) the
proceeds of such transaction attributable to ABL Collateral in accordance with clause (a) above have
been (or will substantially simultaneously be) paid over to the ABL Security Agent for application to the
ABL Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the ABL Documents.

_Waiver of Rights, etc._

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to the sections
“—Enforcement of security,” “—Application of proceeds” and “—Proceeds of disposals—Distressed Disposals,” each of
the Secured Creditors, the Debtors and Security Providers of Fixed Asset Collateral and the ABL Collateral waives all
rights it may otherwise have to require that the Fixed Asset Collateral or the ABL Collateral be enforced in any particular
order or manner or at any particular time or that any sum received or recovered from any person, or by virtue of the
enforcement of any of the Fixed Asset Collateral, ABL Collateral or of any other security interest, which is capable of
being applied in or towards discharge of any of the Secured Obligations is so applied. No Security Agent or any Primary
Creditor shall be responsible to any Intra-Group Lender, Subordinated Creditor, Debtor or Security Provider for any
enforcement or failure to enforce or maximize the proceeds of any enforcement of the Debt Documents, to an extent greater
than as provided under any applicable governing law of a Debt Document.


-----

**_Proceeds of Disposals_**

In this section:

“Distress Event” means an acceleration event or the enforcement of any Fixed Asset Collateral in accordance with
the Fixed Asset Security Documents.

“Distressed Disposal” means a disposal of equity interests of a member of the Group or any asset (not constituting
ABL Collateral) of a member of the Group, in each case, which is being effected (a) at the request of the relevant Instructing
Group in circumstances where the Fixed Asset Collateral has become enforceable, (b) by enforcement, or simultaneous
with the enforcement, of the Fixed Asset Collateral (including the disposal of any property of a member of the Group, the
shares of which have been subject to an appropriation which is expressly permitted by the terms of the relevant Fixed Asset
Security Documents) or (c) after the occurrence of a Distress Event, by or on behalf of a Debtor or Security Provider to a
person or persons which is, or are, not a member, or members, of the Group.

_Non-Distressed Disposals of Fixed Asset Collateral_

The Intercreditor Agreement contains certain provisions governing the disposal of an asset which is the subject of
Fixed Asset Collateral and which is subject to receipt of instructions by the Fixed Asset Security Agent in accordance with
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the provisions described under “—Application of Proceeds and Releases
Involving a Combination of ABL Collateral and Fixed Asset Collateral.”

If, in respect of a disposal, sale or transfer other than a Distressed Disposal of an asset which is or constitutes
Fixed Asset Collateral by a Debtor or Security Provider or any other transaction involving Fixed Asset Collateral, (i) the
Company certifies for the benefit of each Security Agent that that disposal, sale or transfer or other transaction is permitted
under the Debt Documents relating to the Primary Obligations (the “Primary Debt Documents”), or, in the case of a Hedge
Agreement or an agreement in respect of Cash Management Arrangements, not prohibited; or (ii) each relevant
Representative authorizes the release in accordance with the terms of the applicable Primary Debt Documents, then the
Fixed Asset Security Agent will be irrevocably authorized and obliged (A) to release its lien on such Fixed Asset Collateral
or any other claim (relating to a Primary Debt Document) over the Fixed Asset Collateral; (B) where that asset consists of
shares in the capital of a Debtor, to release its lien on such Fixed Asset Collateral or any other claim (relating to a Primary
Debt Document) over that Debtor’s assets consisting of Fixed Asset Collateral and, to the extent that they are at such time
being disposed of, sold or otherwise transferred in accordance with this paragraph, the release its lien on assets consisting
of Fixed Asset Collateral of any subsidiary of that Debtor and, to the extent that they are at such time being disposed of,
sold or otherwise transferred in accordance with this paragraph, the release its lien on assets of such subsidiaries of that
Debtor consisting of Fixed Asset Collateral; and (C) to execute and deliver or enter into any release of the Fixed Asset
Collateral or any claim described in clause (A) above necessary or desirable (each such disposal, sale, transfer or other
transaction, a “Non-Distressed Disposal”).

The above provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be construed to impose any condition to the release
of Fixed Asset Collateral that, by the terms of each applicable Debt Documents is automatically and unconditionally
released and discharged upon the disposal, sale or transfer of the applicable asset or consummation of the applicable
transaction (including upon the release of a guarantor’s guarantee of the Unsecured Obligations).

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that if the proceeds of a Non-Distressed Disposal are required to be applied
in mandatory prepayment of any of the Obligations or to be offered to any parties pursuant to the terms of the relevant Debt
Documents, then such proceeds shall, subject to any restriction on the making of payments set out in the Intercreditor
Agreement or the Debt Documents, be applied in or towards payment of such Obligations or shall be offered to the relevant
parties in accordance with the terms of the relevant Debt Documents and the consent of any other Party shall not be required
for that application.

_Distressed Disposals_

Subject to certain specified provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement (including, without limitation, those
described under “—Application of Proceeds and Releases Involving a Combination of ABL Collateral and Fixed Asset
_Collateral”) and receipt by the Fixed Asset Security Agent of instructions pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, if a_
Distressed Disposal is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Fixed Asset Security Agent is
irrevocably authorized and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation:

(a) to release the liens on the Fixed Asset Collateral or any other claim over the asset subject to the Distressed
Disposal (other than any ABL Collateral or any Obligations or claims which constitute ABL Obligations)
and to execute and deliver or enter into any release of liens over that Fixed Asset Collateral or claim
(other than any ABL Collateral or any Obligations or claims which constitute ABL Obligations) and


-----

issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the
discretion of the Fixed Asset Security Agent, be considered necessary or desirable;

(b) if the asset subject to the Distressed Disposal consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, to release:
(A) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of: (I) its borrower Obligations;
(II) its guarantee Obligations; and (III) its other Obligations; (B) any liens granted over any assets (other
than ABL Collateral) by (I) that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor or (II) the direct holding
company over the shares in the capital of that Debtor; and (C) any other claim of a Subordinated Creditor,
an Intra-Group Lender or another Debtor or other Security Provider of Fixed Asset Collateral over that
Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor not constituting ABL Collateral, on
behalf of the relevant Creditors, Debtors, Security Providers and the Representatives in each case other
than any Obligations or claims which constitute ABL Obligations;

(c) if the asset subject to the Distressed Disposal consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of
a Debtor, to release: (A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or
any part of: (I) its borrower Obligations; (II) its guarantee Obligations; (III) its other Obligations; (B) any
liens granted over any assets (other than ABL Collateral) by that holding company and any subsidiary of
that holding company; and (C) any other claim of a Subordinated Creditor, an Intra-Group Lender or
another Debtor or other grantor of Collateral over the assets of that holding company and any subsidiary
of that holding company not constituting ABL Collateral, on behalf of the relevant creditors, Debtors,
Security Providers and the Representatives in each case other than any Obligations or claims which
constitute ABL Obligations;

(d) if the asset subject to the Distressed Disposal consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor and the Fixed Asset Security Agent decides to dispose of all or any part of: (A) the
Obligations (other than the Agent Obligations and the ABL Obligations) or (B) the Obligations (other
than the Agent Obligations and the ABL Obligations) owed by that Debtor or holding company or any
subsidiary of that Debtor or holding company then: (I) if the Fixed Asset Security Agent does not intend
that any transferee of those Obligations or that Debtor’s Obligations (the “Transferee”) will be treated as
a Primary Creditor or a Secured Creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement, to enter into any agreement
to dispose of all or part of those Obligations or that Debtor’s Obligations; provided, that notwithstanding
any other provision of any Debt Document, the Transferee is not treated as a Primary Creditor or a
Secured Creditor for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement and (II) if the Fixed Asset Security
Agent does intend that any Transferee will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Creditor for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose
of: (1) all (and not part only) of the Obligations (other than the Agent Obligations and the ABL
Obligations) owed to the Primary Creditors; and (2) all or part of any other Obligations (other than the
Agent Obligations and the ABL Obligations) and the Debtor Obligations, on behalf of, in each case, the
relevant creditors and Debtors; and

(e) if the asset subject to the Distressed Disposal consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Fixed Asset Security Agent decides to transfer (to
the extent permitted by applicable law) to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any part of the
Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of any subsidiary of that Disposed Entity in respect of:
the Intra-Group Obligations, any Obligations owed to other Debtors or members of the Group (“Debtor
Obligations”), the Subordinated Obligations; to execute and deliver and enter into any agreement to:
(I) agree to the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of those Intra-Group Obligations, Debtor
Obligations or Subordinated Obligations on behalf of the relevant Intra-Group Lenders, Debtors or, as
the case may be, the Subordinated Creditors to which those obligations are owed and on behalf of the
Debtors which owe those obligations; and (II) to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in
respect of those Intra-Group Obligations, Debtor Obligations or Subordinated Obligations on behalf of
the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in respect of those Intra-Group
Obligations, Debtor Obligations or Subordinated Obligations, as the case may be, are to be transferred.

The Intercreditor Agreement requires that the net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of
any disposal of Obligations), in each case effected pursuant to clauses (a) through (e) above shall be paid to either the Fixed
Asset Security Agent or, as required under the provisions described under “—Application of Proceeds and Releases
_Involving a Combination of ABL Collateral and Fixed Asset Collateral,” the applicable Security Agent, in each case for_
application in accordance with the payment waterfall, as described below in the section “—Application of Proceeds.”


-----

_Release of Unrestricted Subsidiaries_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that if a member of the Group is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary
(as that term is defined in the Existing Indentures and the Indenture) in accordance with the terms of each of the Primary
Documents (to the extent such Primary Documents contain provisions addressing the designation of members of the Group
as Unrestricted Subsidiaries), each Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and obliged, at the cost of the Company and
without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any Creditor, other Secured Party or any Debtor or
other Security Provider: (i) to release the Collateral or any other claim (relating to a Debt Document) over that member of
the Group’s assets and its shares granted to such Security Agent and (ii) to execute and deliver or enter into any release of
the Collateral or any claim described in clause (i) above and issue any certificates of non-crystallization of any floating

would adversely affect such Hedge Counterparties); (iii) the Cash Management Providers (to the extent that the
amendment, restatement, supplement, modification, waiver or consent would adversely affect such Cash Management
Providers); (iv) the Security Agents and (v) the Company provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the ABL Hedge
Counterparties and the ABL Cash Management Providers shall not have any consent rights hereunder in their capacities as
such unless such amendment, restatement, supplementation, modification or waiver is related to the rights or obligations
of such parties.

The Intercreditor Agreement further provides that an amendment, restatement, supplement, modification, waiver
or consent that relates to (a) the provisions described under “—Enforcement of security—Manner of Enforcement—Fixed
Asset Collateral” may be made by the Company, the Super Senior Agent, the ABL Agent and the Security Agents together
with the Majority First Lien Creditors and the Majority Second Lien Creditors (acting through the relevant Representative)
or (b) the provisions described under “—Enforcement of security—Manner of Enforcement—ABL Collateral” may be
made by the Company, the ABL Agent and the Security Agents together with the Majority First Lien Creditors and the
Majority Second Lien Creditors (acting through the relevant Representative).

Subject to certain exceptions, with respect to any Fixed Asset Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement
provides that (unless expressly provided for otherwise in the relevant Debt Document) the Fixed Asset Security Agent
may, if authorized by the Majority First Lien Creditors and the Majority Super Senior Creditors (in each case, acting in
accordance with the relevant Debt Documents and, in each case, provided that for purposes of determining the Majority
Super Senior Creditors, the Super Senior Hedge Counterparties and their respective super senior credit participations (if
any) shall be excluded unless the relevant amendment, restatement, supplement, modification, waiver or consent would
adversely affect such Super Senior Hedge Counterparties) and if the Company consents, amend, restate, supplement,


-----

modify, waive or grant consent under, any of the Fixed Asset Security Documents, which shall be binding on each party
to the Intercreditor Agreement. Subject to certain exceptions, with respect to any ABL Security Documents, the

Security Agent may, if authorized by the ABL Creditors and if the Company consents, amend, restate, supplement, modify,
waive or grant consent under, any of the ABL Security Documents, which shall be binding on each party to the Intercreditor
Agreement. Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement overrides
anything in the Debt Documents to the contrary.

majority of the principal amount of the then-outstanding First Lien Obligations (other than First Lien Hedging Obligations)
may, after a Distress Event, after having given all other First Lien Creditors the opportunity to participate in such purchase,

of all, but not less than all, of the rights, benefits and obligations in respect of the Super Senior Obligations and the ABL
Obligations (in each case other than any Hedging Obligations) or solely the Super Senior Obligations. Subject to certain

following the discharge of all other Super Senior Obligations and ABL Obligations.

Subject to certain conditions, Second Lien Creditors holding at least a majority of the principal amount of the

require the transfer to them (or to a nominee or nominees) of all, but not less than all, of the rights, benefits and obligations

otherwise required to permit the refinancing transaction under the Debt Documents, including the Existing Indentures and
the Indenture) of any Fixed Asset Security Agent, any other Fixed Asset Creditor, the ABL Security Agent or any other
ABL Creditor, as applicable, all without affecting the lien priorities and rights in respect of the Collateral provided for in

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

The following is a description of the $600 million 6.000% senior secured green notes due 2027 (the “Senior
_Secured Notes”)._

The Senior Secured Notes will be issued by Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance USA LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (“AMP USA”) and Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance plc, a public limited company incorporated under
the laws of Ireland (“AMP Ireland” and together with AMP USA, the “Issuers”). You will find definitions of certain
capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Notes” under the heading “Certain Definitions” below. For purposes of
this “Description of the Notes,” references to the “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us” refer only to Ardagh Metal
Packaging S.A. and not to any of its Subsidiaries, except for the purpose of financial data determined on a consolidated or
combined basis, as the case may be. The term “Issuers” refers only to AMP USA and AMP Ireland collectively, and not to
any of their respective Subsidiaries.

The Issuers will issue the Senior Secured Notes under an indenture to be dated on or about the Issue Date (the
“Indenture”), between, inter alios, the Issuers, the Company as guarantor, Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as trustee (in
such capacity, the “Trustee”) and as security agent (in such capacity, the “Security Agent”) and Citibank, N.A., London
Branch as paying agent, in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
The Indenture will not be qualified under, incorporate by reference or include, or be subject to, any of the provisions of the
Trust Indenture Act, including Section 316(b) thereof. Consequently, the Holders will not be entitled to the protections
provided under the Trust Indenture Act to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including among
other things, those requiring the Trustee to resign in the event of certain conflicts of interest and to inform the Holders of
certain relationships between it and us.

Following the Issue Date, the Company intends to amend its articles of association to permit the issuance of the
Preferred Shares as described in “Summary— The Offering of Preferred Shares.”

The proceeds from the offering of the Senior Secured Notes sold on the Issue Date will be released to the Issuers
and used with the proceeds from the subscription for the Preferred Shares as described in “Use of Proceeds.”

Upon the initial issuance of the Senior Secured Notes on the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be (i) direct
obligations of the Issuers and (ii) guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Company. On the Issue Date, the Senior
Secured Notes will be secured by a pledge over 100% of the shares of Ardagh Metal Packaging Group Sarl, a Luxembourg
holding company (“Lux Holdco”), granted by the Company (the “Lux Holdco Share Pledge”). Subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries which guarantee the Existing AMP Notes (as defined below)
and the ABL Facility located in England & Wales, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, the United States and The Netherlands
(together with Lux Holdco and Ardagh Metal Packaging Holdings Sarl, the “Subsidiary Guarantors”) will enter into one
or more supplemental indentures to become a party to the Indenture and guarantee the Senior Secured Notes on a senior
secured basis within 90 days from the Issue Date.

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount. We may, subject to applicable law and the terms
of the Indenture, issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Senior Secured Notes (the “Additional Senior Secured
_Notes”); provided that if any of the Additional Senior Secured Notes are not fungible for U.S. federal income tax purposes_
with the Senior Secured Notes, such Additional Senior Secured Notes will be issued with a separate ISIN code and CUSIP
from the Senior Secured Notes originally issued. We will only be permitted to issue Additional Senior Secured Notes in
compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture, including the covenants restricting the Incurrence of
Indebtedness and the Incurrence of Liens. See “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Except as otherwise provided for in the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, and if_
issued, Additional Senior Secured Notes, will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including,
without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context otherwise
requires, in this “Description of the Notes,” references to the “Senior Secured Notes” include the Senior Secured Notes and
any Additional Senior Secured Notes that are actually issued under the Indenture.

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements (as defined below) and in the case of certain conflicts between the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important
to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the
indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover
obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement.

This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Senior Secured


-----

Notes and the Indenture and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. Since this description of
the terms of the Senior Secured Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Senior Secured Notes, the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Company and your
rights. Copies of such documents will be made available from us upon request on and after the Issue Date.

The registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered
Holders will have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of
other remedies. The Senior Secured Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and will be
subject to certain transfer restrictions.

**General**

**The Senior Secured Notes**

The Senior Secured Notes will:

      - be general senior obligations of the Issuers;

      - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness or other obligations of the
Issuers that are not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes (including the ABL
Obligations, the Existing AMP Notes and certain Hedging Obligations);

      - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness or other obligations of the Issuers that
are expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes;

      - be effectively senior to the Issuers’ obligations under the ABL Facility, to the extent of the value of the Fixed
Assets Collateral (as defined below);

      - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of the Issuers and their
Subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes or that secure
the Senior Secured Notes on a junior basis, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such
obligation or indebtedness (including the obligations under the ABL Facility (as described under “Description
_of Other Indebtedness—ABL Facility”), to the extent of the value of the ABL Collateral (as defined below));_

      - be effectively subordinated to obligations under the ABL Facility, to the extent of the value of the ABL
Collateral (as defined below);

      - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the Issuers that are
not Guarantors, including obligations to their trade creditors;

      - be (i) guaranteed by the Company on a senior secured basis on the Issue Date, (ii) secured on the Issue Date
by the Lux Holdco Share Pledge and (iii) subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the Intercreditor
Agreement, be guaranteed by the additional Subsidiary Guarantors, in each case, on a senior secured basis,
secured as set forth under “Security” within 90 days from the Issue Date; and

      - be represented by one or more registered Senior Secured Notes in global form, but in certain circumstances
may be represented by Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes (as defined below). See “Book-entry;
_Delivery and Form.”_

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the
Collateral (as defined below) on a pari passu basis with all indebtedness of the Company that is not subordinated in right
of payment to the Senior Secured Notes, including the Existing AMP Senior Secured Notes (except that, in the case of the
certain Hedging Obligations and other future indebtedness, the creditors of such obligations may receive all or a portion of
the proceeds from the enforcement of security over the Collateral prior to the Holders receiving any amounts under the
Collateral) and the Holders will receive proceeds from the enforcement of Collateral only after any indebtedness with a
prior-ranking Lien on such Collateral is repaid in full, including the obligations under the ABL Facility, in the case of the
ABL Collateral.

The Issuers are finance subsidiaries with no business operations and have no revenue-generating operations of
their own. The Issuers will be dependent upon payments from the Company’s operating Subsidiaries to meet their
obligations, including their obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. The payments to the Issuers will depend on the
profitability and cash flows of the Company and its other Subsidiaries. The Senior Secured Notes will be structurally
subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and


-----

lease obligations) of the Company’s Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors.

As of the Issue Date, the Issuers and all Subsidiaries of the Company will each be a “Restricted Subsidiary” for
the purposes of the Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under “Certain Covenants—Designation
_of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries,” we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted_
_Subsidiaries.” Our Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will_
not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes.

As of March 31, 2022, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions (including the Offering and the
use of the proceeds therefrom as described in “Use of Proceeds”), the Company and its Subsidiaries would have had total
outstanding debt of $3,604 million (equivalent) in aggregate principal amount.

**The Senior Secured Notes Guarantees**

On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed by the Company on a senior secured basis. Subject
to the Agreed Security Principles and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed on a senior
secured basis by the Subsidiary Guarantors within 90 days of the Issue Date. In addition, if required by the covenant
described under “Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees,” certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee (as defined below) in the future. Once granted, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of each of
the Guarantors will:

      - be a general senior secured obligation of that Guarantor;

      - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not
subordinated in right of payment to such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of that Guarantor (including
obligations under the ABL Facility, the Existing AMP Senior Secured Notes and certain Hedging
Obligations);

      - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor that is subordinated
in right of payment to its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee (including the Existing Notes Guarantees provided
in respect of the Existing AMP Senior Notes);

      - be effectively senior to the that Guarantor’s obligations under the ABL Facility, to the extent of the value of
the Fixed Assets Collateral;

      - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of that Guarantor and its
subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such indebtedness or
securing the Senior Secured Notes on a junior basis (including the obligations under the ABL Facility, to the
extent of the value of the ABL Collateral);

      - be effectively subordinated to that Guarantor’s obligations under the ABL Facility, to the extent of the value
of the ABL Collateral; and

      - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of that Guarantor that
do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes, including their obligations to trade creditors.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Senior Secured Notes will mature on June 15, 2027, unless redeemed prior to such date as described herein.
On the Issue Date, the Issuers will issue $600 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes.

The Senior Secured Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples of
$1,000 in excess thereof.

The Senior Secured Notes (together with any Additional Senior Secured Notes) will be treated as a single class
for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and
offers to purchase and any other action by the Holders hereunder, except as otherwise provided in the Indenture.

Interest on overdue principal and interest on the Senior Secured Notes will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher than
the interest rate on the overdue principal or interest.

**Interest on the Senior Secured Notes**


-----

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will accrue at the rate of 6.000% per annum. Interest on the Senior Secured
Notes will be payable on December 15, 2022, and thereafter semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15. Interest
on the Senior Secured Notes will be payable to the holder of record of such Senior Secured Notes on the Business Day
immediately preceding the related interest payment date.

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been
paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve
30-day months.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on the Senior Secured Notes are subject to applicable
procedures of DTC. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Senior Secured Notes is not a Business Day at the
place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until
the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result
of any such delay.

If the Issuers redeem any Senior Secured Notes on a date that is on or after the record date and on or before the
corresponding interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid
on the redemption date to the Holder in whose name the Senior Secured Note is registered at the close of business on such
record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Senior Secured Notes will be subject to redemption
by the Issuers.

The right of holders of beneficial interests in the Senior Secured Notes to receive the payment on such Senior
Secured Notes will be subject to the applicable procedures of DTC.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Senior Secured Notes**

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes will be made by
one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the registered
Holder thereof (initially being Cede & Co. on behalf of DTC).

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive
_Registered Senior Secured Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents_
maintained for such purposes in London, United Kingdom. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Senior Secured
Notes may be paid, at the option of the Issuers, by check mailed by the Issuers to the address of the Holder entitled thereto
as shown on the register of Holders for the Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes. See “Paying Agent and Registrar
_for the Senior Secured Notes” below._

**Principal Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Secured Notes**

The Issuers will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Senior Secured Notes. The initial Paying Agent will
be Citibank, N.A., London Branch (the “Principal Paying Agent”).

The Issuers will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”) and one or more transfer agents (each,
the “Transfer Agent”). The initial Registrar will be Citibank Europe plc and the initial Transfer Agent will be Citibank,
N.A., London Branch.

The Registrar and the Transfer Agent will maintain a register for the Senior Secured Notes reflecting ownership
of the Senior Secured Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and together with the Transfer Agent, will facilitate
transfers of the Senior Secured Notes on behalf of the Issuers.

A register of the Holders shall be left at the registered offices of the Issuers. In case of inconsistency between the
register of Senior Secured Notes kept by the Registrar and the one kept by the Issuers at their registered offices, the register
kept by the Registrar shall prevail.

Upon written notice to the Trustee, the Issuers may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the
Senior Secured Notes without prior notice to the Holders of such Senior Secured Notes. The Issuers or any of its
Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Senior Secured Notes.

**Senior Secured Notes Guarantees**

**General**

On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Company. Subject


-----

to the Agreed Security Principles and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Subsidiary Guarantors will guarantee, jointly and
severally, on a senior secured basis (each, a “Senior Secured Notes Guarantee” and together, the “Senior Secured Notes
_Guarantees”) the obligations of the Issuers pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes, including any payment obligation_
resulting from a Change of Control, within 90 days of the Issue Date.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Guarantors will be Ardagh Metal
Packaging S.A. and certain subsidiaries that guarantee the Existing AMP Notes and the ABL Facility in each of England &
Wales, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, the United States, The Netherlands and, with respect to Lux Holdco and Ardagh
Metal Packaging Holdings Sarl only, Luxembourg (the “Subsidiary Guarantors”). The Subsidiary Guarantors accounted
for 76% of the aggregate total assets and 68% of the Adjusted EBITDA of the Group as of and for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2022.

Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the issuance of Disqualified Stock of the
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a
number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by the Company
or the Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
under the Indenture. See “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Certain Definitions—Indebtedness.”

In addition, as described under _“Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor_
Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain Subsidiaries of the Company that guarantee the ABL Facility, the
Existing AMP Notes or the Senior Secured Notes in the future or any other Credit Facility or Public Debt, in each case, of
the Issuers or a Guarantor, shall also enter into a supplemental senior secured notes indenture as a Guarantor and accede to
the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the
Senior Secured Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among
other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial
assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules,
retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate
to the benefit accruing to the Holders. See “Security—The Collateral.”

Each Senior Secured Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the
Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles,
to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation
under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Debt, the Notes and the Guarantees—Corporate benefit, capital maintenance laws and_
_other limitations on the Guarantees and the Security Interests may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the_
_Guarantees of the Notes and the Security Interests” and “—The insolvency laws of Luxembourg and other local insolvency_
_laws may not be as favorable to you as U.S. bankruptcy laws or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar.”_

A portion of the operations of the Company will be conducted through Subsidiaries that are not expected to
become Guarantors. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors
holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those
Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any)
generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of
creditors of the Issuers and the Guarantors, including Holders. The Senior Secured Notes and each Senior Secured Notes
Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if
any) of the Company’s Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of
non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any). As of March 31, 2022, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the
Transactions (including the Offering and the use of the proceeds therefrom as described in “Use of Proceeds”), the
Company would have had, on a consolidated basis, total outstanding debt of $3,604 million (equivalent) in aggregate
principal amount.

**Senior Secured Notes Guarantee Release**

The Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will automatically terminate and be released:

(1) upon a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, merger, or
amalgamation) of any Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding
company of such Guarantor) as a result of which such Guarantor would no longer be a Restricted
Subsidiary, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to


-----

the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case if such sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition
does not violate the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(2) upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(3) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes in
accordance with the Indenture, as provided in “Defeasance” and “Satisfaction and Discharge,”
respectively;

(4) upon the release of the Guarantor’s Guarantee of any Indebtedness that triggered such Guarantor’s
obligation to guarantee the Senior Secured Notes under the covenant described in “Certain Covenants—
_Additional Guarantees”; provided that no other Indebtedness is at that time Guaranteed by the Guarantor_
that would result in the requirement that the Guarantor provide a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee
pursuant to the covenant described under the caption “Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees”;

(5) pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(6) as described under “Amendments and Waivers”;

(7) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization; provided that the resulting, surviving or transferee Person
is or becomes a Guarantor substantially concurrently with such Permitted Reorganization;

(8) upon payment in full of principal and interest and all other obligations on the Senior Secured Notes; or

(9) as a result of a transaction permitted by “Merger and Consolidation.”

The Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of the Company will automatically terminate and be released only upon the
circumstances described in clauses (3), (5), (6), (7), (8) and (9) set forth above.

The Trustee shall, subject to receipt of certain documentation requested pursuant to the Indenture, take all
necessary actions at the reasonable request and cost of the Company, including the granting of releases or waivers under
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Senior Secured Notes
Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases
set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without the consent of the Holders and will not require any other action or
consent on the part of the Trustee. Neither the Trustee nor the Company will be required to make a notation on the Senior
Secured Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge.

**Security**

**The Collateral**

On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be secured on a first-priority basis by the Lux Holdco Share
Pledge.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, within 90 days of the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be
secured, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and certain perfection requirements, by security interests and pledges
granted on:

(i) an equal and ratable first-ranking/first-priority basis over the following property, rights and assets:

(a) all assets (other than real property and the ABL Collateral and certain other relevant exclusions)
of Subsidiary Guarantors incorporated in each of England & Wales and the United States; and

(b) certain shares of Subsidiary Guarantors incorporated in each of England & Wales, Germany,
Ireland, the United States and The Netherlands;

(collectively, the “Fixed Assets Collateral”); and

(ii) a junior basis over all of the assets that secure, among other things, the obligations under the ABL Facility
on a first-ranking/first priority basis (collectively, the “ABL Collateral” and, together with the Fixed
Assets Collateral, the “Collateral”), including where applicable and subject to limited exceptions:


-----

(a) accounts (including accounts receivable and deposit accounts), and inventory;

(b) certain related assets;

(c) all proceeds of any of the foregoing, located in England & Wales, France, Germany, the
Netherlands, Poland, Spain and/or the United States and owned by relevant Subsidiary
Guarantors;

(d) certain intercompany receivables of a Subsidiary Guarantor located in Switzerland; and

(e) deposit accounts of a Subsidiary Guarantor located in Ireland.

The Security Interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent on behalf of and for the benefit of the Holders
pursuant to the Security Documents. The Collateral may also secure certain future Indebtedness, including certain Hedging
Obligations and other future indebtedness; _provided that, in the case of certain Hedging Obligations and other future_
indebtedness, the creditors of such obligations may receive all or a portion of the proceeds from the enforcement of security
over the Collateral prior to the Holders receiving any amounts under the Collateral. The Fixed Assets Collateral will also
secure the obligations under the ABL Facility, on a junior priority basis as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. The
proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest” and “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Company and the Restricted_
Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of Indebtedness or
Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including, subject to certain requirements described herein, Additional Senior
Secured Notes, as permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent on behalf of the Holders
and holders of certain of the other secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral. Any other assets subject to Security
Interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, any Senior Secured Notes
Guarantees and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.” All Collateral pledged pursuant to the Security Documents
will be subject to the limitations that are applicable to Senior Secured Notes Guarantees granted by the same entity, the
operation of the Agreed Security Principles, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Permitted Collateral Liens.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed
by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance
or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws,
regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Liens,” the Indenture will provide that certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge_
over property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security
Principles. For a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles as they apply to the ABL
Facility, and which will apply to the Senior Secured Notes, mutatis mutandis, see “Description of Other Indebtedness—
_ABL Facility.”_

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with the offering of the Senior Secured Notes. By
its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly,
the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Debt,
_the Notes and the Guarantees—The value of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees may not be sufficient to_
_satisfy our obligations under the Notes and the Collateral securing the Notes may be reduced or diluted under certain_
_circumstances.”_

**Priority**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents (such security interests, the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between (a) the lenders
under the ABL Facility, as described under “Description of Other Indebtedness—ABL Facility,” (b) the counterparties
under certain Hedging Obligations, (c) the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders under the Indenture, (d) the trustee,
security agent and the holders of the Existing AMP Senior Secured Notes under the indenture governing the Existing AMP
Senior Secured Notes and (e) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness (including Indebtedness that may be Incurred in
the future) permitted to be secured by such Collateral, respectively, will be established by the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, which will provide, among other things, that with respect to the Collateral, (i) the obligations under the ABL
Facility, will be secured by senior priority liens on the ABL Collateral and by junior priority liens on the Fixed Assets


-----

Collateral, (ii) the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees will be secured by senior priority liens
on the Fixed Assets Collateral and junior priority liens on the ABL Collateral and (iii) certain Hedging Obligations and
certain other indebtedness may receive all or portion of the proceeds from the enforcement of security over the Collateral
prior to the Holders receiving any amounts under the Collateral. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
_Agreement” and “Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

**Security Documents**

Under the Security Documents, the Company and other Guarantors will grant security over the Collateral to secure
the payment when due of the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into by the relevant security provider
and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into such Security Documents, the Security Agent
will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders from time
to time).

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, only
the Security Agent (or, if the collateral represented by the Security Documents is held by a creditor other than the Security
Agent, that creditor) will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders. As a
consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the
Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes, except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject to the
provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent (or such creditor) for the Collateral (as applicable).

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral
until all obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security
Interests with respect to the Senior Secured Notes and the Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as
provided under “—Release of Liens.”

In the event that the Company or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the
Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor
Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement were successful, the Holders might not be able to recover any amounts under the Security
Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Debt, the Notes and the Guarantees—The granting of the Security
_Interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes may create hardening periods for such Security Interests in_
_accordance with the law applicable in certain jurisdictions.”_

**Enforcement of Security Interest**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to enforce the
Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Security Documents in certain
circumstances upon enforcement by the Security Agent in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. These
limitations are described under “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.” The ability to enforce may
also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance
with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Debt, the Notes and the
_Guarantees—The insolvency laws of Luxembourg and other local insolvency laws may not be as favorable to you as U.S._
_bankruptcy laws or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar.”_

The counterparties to Hedging Obligations that are secured by the Fixed Assets Collateral on a senior priority
basis and the Trustee have and, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, appointed the
Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents securing such
Indebtedness.

**Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound**

The Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting such Senior Secured Note, will be deemed (without
any further consent of the Holders) to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents and
perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under
the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents securing such Indebtedness, together with any
other incidental rights, power and discretions;


-----

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Security Documents; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply
with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the
Security Documents (including the execution of, and compliance with, any waiver, modification,
amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Trustee or the Security Agent on
its behalf).

See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Debt, the Notes and the Guarantees—The Security Interests over the
_Collateral have been, or will be, granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability_
_of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law.” Similar provisions to those described above_
may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant
described under “Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

**Release of Liens**

Release of the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral will be permitted under any one or more of the
following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not the Company or
a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “Merger and Consolidation”), if such
sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and is otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture or (b) any_
Restricted Subsidiary; provided that this clause 1(b) shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer of
Capital Stock or of accounts receivable (including intercompany loan receivables and hedging
receivables) to a Restricted Subsidiary (except to a Securitization Subsidiary) unless the relevant property
and assets remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to, a Lien in favor of the Senior Secured Notes
following such sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms
of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “Amendments and Waivers”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior Secured Notes or legal
defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes, as provided
in “Defeasance” and “Satisfaction and Discharge,” respectively;

(5) automatically without any action by the Trustee, if the Lien granted in favor of the Indebtedness that
gave rise to the obligation to grant the Lien over such Collateral is released;

(6) in a transaction that complies with the provisions described in “Merger and Consolidation”; provided
that in such a transaction where the Company or any Guarantor ceases to exist, the Lien on the Capital
Stock of the Company or such Guarantor will be released and, subject to the Agreed Security Principles
and the Intercreditor Agreement, will reattach (or a new Lien will be created) over the Capital Stock of
the successor entity pursuant to a new share pledge (on terms substantially equivalent to the existing Lien
on the Capital Stock of the Company or such Guarantor, as applicable) granted by the holder of such
Capital Stock;

(7) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization;

(8) if the Company designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of
such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(9) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture; or

(10) pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released as may be permitted by the
covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”


-----

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required) will take all necessary action reasonably requested by,
and at the cost of, the Company to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be
effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders (except to the extent required under clause (3) above) or
any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such release). The Security Agent and the
Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying
which circumstance, as described above, giving rise to a release of the Security Interests has occurred, and that such release
complies with the Indenture.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

On the Issue Date, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. However, in the
circumstances described below under “Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries,” the
Company will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will
not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.

**Optional Redemption**

**Senior Secured Notes**

Except as set forth below, and except as described under “Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” the Senior Secured
Notes are not redeemable at the option of the Issuers.

At any time prior to June 15, 2024, the Issuers may redeem the Senior Secured Notes (in whole or in part, at its
option, upon notice as described under “Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount
of such Senior Secured Notes plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts,
if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time prior to June 15, 2024, the Issuers may, at their option, during each calendar
year redeem up to 10% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including the original principal
amount of any Additional Senior Secured Notes), upon giving notice as described under “Selection and Notice,” at a
redemption price equal to 103.000% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time prior to June 15, 2024, the Issuers may, at their option, redeem Senior Secured
Notes upon notice as described under “Selection and Notice,” with the Net Cash Proceeds received by the Issuers from any
Equity Offering at a redemption price equal to 106.000% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes so redeemed,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date in an aggregate
principal amount for all such redemptions not to exceed 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes (including any Additional Senior Secured Notes), as applicable; provided that:

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related Equity
Offering; and

(2) not less than 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including
Additional Senior Secured Notes), as applicable, issued under the Indenture remains outstanding
immediately thereafter.

At any time and from time to time on or after June 15, 2024, the Issuers may redeem the Senior Secured Notes,
in whole or in part, upon notice as described under “Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to the percentage
of principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes so redeemed set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on
the Senior Secured Notes redeemed, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date and Additional Amounts, if any, if
redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on June 15, of the year indicated below:

2025 ................................................................................................................................... 101.500%
2026, and thereafter ........................................................................................................... 100.000%

**Other Redemption Terms**


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Senior Secured Notes, including a
Change of Control Offer (as defined below) or Asset Disposition Offer (as defined below), if Holders of not less than 90%
in aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Senior Secured Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such
Senior Secured Notes in such tender offer and the Issuers, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the
Issuers, purchases all of the Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuers or such
third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days
following such tender offer expiration date, to redeem the Senior Secured Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not
in part following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder (excluding any early tender or
incentive fee) in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, such redemption date.

Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, we may
repurchase the Senior Secured Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “Selection and Notice” below.

Unless the Issuers default in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Senior
Secured Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund**

The Issuers are not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to
the Senior Secured Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Senior
Secured Notes as described under “Change of Control” and “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and
_Subsidiary Stock.”_

**Selection and Notice**

If fewer than all of the Senior Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, DTC will credit their participants’
accounts on a pro rata pass-through distribution of principal basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or on such other
basis as they deem fair and appropriate in accordance with the rules and procedures of DTC. No book-entry interest of less
than $200,000 in principal amount may be redeemed in part, and book-entry interests may be redeemed only in multiples
of $1,000. If the Senior Secured Notes are not held through DTC or DTC prescribes no method of selection, the Senior
Secured Notes will be selected, on a pro rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Senior Secured Note in an unauthorized
denomination remains outstanding after such redemption. The Trustee, any Paying Agent and the Registrar shall not be
liable for selections made under this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least 10 days but not more
than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Senior Secured Notes to be redeemed at the address of such
Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, except that
redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is
issued in connection with a defeasance of the Senior Secured Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

Notice of any redemption of the Senior Secured Notes may, at the Issuers’ discretion, be given prior to the
completion of a transaction (including, but not limited to, an Equity Offering, an Incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of
Control or other transaction) and any redemption may, at the Issuers’ discretion, be subject to one or more conditions
precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a related transaction. If such redemption or purchase is so subject to
satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice of redemption shall describe each such condition, and if
applicable, shall state that, in the Issuers’ discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time (but not more
than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption was sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such
redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall
not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed. In addition, the Issuers may provide
in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuers’ obligations with respect to such
redemption may be performed by another Person.

If and for so long as any Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the
extent the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuers will notify the Exchange of any such notice to the Holders of the
Senior Secured Notes and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuers will notify the Exchange of any change in the
principal amount of Senior Secured Notes outstanding.

If any Definitive Registered Senior Secured Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that
relates to that Definitive Registered Senior Secured Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be
redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Definitive Registered Senior Secured Note will be issued in the name of


-----

the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Senior Secured Note. In the case of a global
Senior Secured Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Senior Secured Note to decrease the principal amount
thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice
(including any conditions contained therein), Senior Secured Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for
redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest
ceases to accrue on Senior Secured Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuers may redeem the Senior Secured Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than
10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal
to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the date fixed
for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts, as defined below under “Withholding
_Taxes,” if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise,_
if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation which is announced and becomes
effective after the Issue Date (or, where such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction at a later date, after such later date); or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, the official application, administration or written interpretation of such
laws, regulations or rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent
jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) which is announced and becomes effective
after the Issue Date (or, where such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
at a later date, after such later date) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Senior Secured Notes would be, required
to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Senior Secured Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment
giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuers or a Guarantor who can make such payment without the
obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to
the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable).
The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obliged to make at least
one payment on the Senior Secured Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person
becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor Person
becomes a party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under
“Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 60 days
prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional Amounts and
(b) unless at the time such notice is given, the obligation to pay Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the
publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuers will
deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided
by the relevant Payor taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) a written opinion of an independent tax counsel of
recognized standing qualified under the laws of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and satisfactory to the Trustee (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional
Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s
Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without
liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of an Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) (each, a
“Payor”) in respect of the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, as applicable, will
be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or
deduction of such Taxes is then required by law or by the relevant taxing authority’s interpretation or administration thereof.
If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction (other than the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia) from or
through which payment on any such Senior Secured Note or Senior Secured Notes Guarantee is made
(including by the Paying Agent) or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein
having the power to tax; or


-----

(2) any other jurisdiction (other than the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia) in
which a Payor is organized, resident, or doing business for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or
governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant
_Taxing Jurisdiction”),_

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor with respect to any
Senior Secured Note or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest
or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”)
as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by each Holder in respect of such payments, after such
withholding or deduction (including any such withholding or deduction in respect of such Additional Amounts), will not
be less than the amounts which would have been received by each Holder in respect of such payments on any such Senior
Secured Note or Senior Secured Notes Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that
no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present
or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member,
partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an
estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (other than the mere receipt, ownership, holding or disposition of such Senior Secured Note
or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Senior Secured Note,
the Indenture or a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee);

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the
beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the Payor
addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice, to provide certification, information,
documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such
beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement
relating to such matters, whether required by a law, statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice
of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Tax, but, in
each case, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible to do so;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Senior Secured
Note for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the later of the applicable
payment date or the date the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the holder (except
to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Senior Secured
Note been presented on the last day of such 30-day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment made under or
with respect to the Senior Secured Notes or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Tax;

(6) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), as of the Issue Date (and any amended or successor
version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with), any current
or future regulations promulgated thereunder, or other official administrative interpretations thereof and
any agreements entered into pursuant to current section 1471(b) of the Code, as of the Issue Date (and
any amended or successor version described above), and including (for the avoidance of doubt) any
intergovernmental agreement (and any law, regulation or practice implementing any such
intergovernmental agreement) in respect of the foregoing; or

(7) any combination of the items (1) through (6) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any payment to a holder who is a fiduciary or a
partnership or any person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler
with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Senior Secured Notes directly.

In addition, the Payor will pay, and reimburse each applicable Holder for, any present or future stamp, issue,
registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest, penalties or other
similar liabilities with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including
any related interest, penalties or similar liabilities with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from
(i) the execution, issuance, delivery or registration of the Senior Secured Notes, any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, the


-----

Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto, or (ii) the receipt of any payments under or with respect
to, or enforcement of, the Senior Secured Notes or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee (limited, solely in the case of any
such taxes attributable to the receipt of payments, to any such taxes that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3), (5),
or (6) above).

The Payor, if it is the applicable withholding agent, will (i) make any required withholding or deduction, (ii) remit
the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law, and (iii) upon written
request, provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other
reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee (with a copy to the Principal Paying
Agent). Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the
offices of the Principal Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Senior Secured
Note or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to
the Trustee and the Principal Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable
and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Principal Paying Agent to
pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises
less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as
promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee and the Principal Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such
Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any
context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Senior Secured
Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Secured Notes or any Senior Secured
Notes Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional
Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by
a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction (other than the United States, any state
thereof or the District of Columbia) in which any successor to a Payor is organized, resident, or doing business for tax
purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Senior Secured Notes (or
any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority
or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless (i) a third party makes a change of control
offer as described herein or (ii) the Issuers have previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption
notice with respect to all the outstanding Senior Secured Notes as described under “Optional Redemption,” the Issuers will
make an offer to purchase all of the Senior Secured Notes (equal to $200,000 in principal amount or in integral multiples
of $1,000 in excess thereof; _provided that Senior Secured Notes of $200,000 or less in principal amount may only be_
redeemed in whole and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash
equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any,
to but excluding the date of repurchase. Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Issuers will deliver or cause
to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of
DTC or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the security
register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC describing the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes for the specified purchase price on
the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such
notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of
a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below.


-----

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and
regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The
Issuers may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend
enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that
permit the Holders to require that the Issuers repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured Notes in the event of a takeover,
recapitalization or similar transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may (i) constitute a default under the ABL
Facility that permits the ABL Facility lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder and (ii) trigger a
requirement for the Issuers to make an offer to repurchase the Existing AMP Notes at a price in cash equal to 101% of the
aggregate principal amount thereof. Future Indebtedness of the Issuers or the Restricted Subsidiaries may contain
prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased
upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuers to repurchase the
Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to
the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuers.

The Issuers’ ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited
by their then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any
required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Senior Secured Notes may in certain circumstances
make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change
of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes and us.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuers could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including
acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but
that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit
ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture_
can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then
outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants
or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third
party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements
set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and purchases all Senior Secured
Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all
outstanding Senior Secured Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under “Optional Redemption,”
unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the
redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice
to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a
Change of Control.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the
phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition
of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear
as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Company to make an offer to
repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior
Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the consent of the Holders of a majority
in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding.

If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the
extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuers will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture. For the avoidance of
doubt, the consummation of the Transactions shall not be prohibited by the covenants below.


-----

**Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status**

Following the first day that:

(a) the Senior Secured Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture,

then, beginning on that day and continuing until the Reversion Date (as defined below), the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following headings (collectively,
the “Suspended Covenants”):

      - “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

      - “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

      - “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

      - “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

      - “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

      - “—Additional Guarantees”; and

      - the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of “Merger and Consolidation”.

If at any time the Senior Secured Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status, then the Suspended Covenants
will thereafter be reinstated as if such covenants had never been suspended (the “Reversion Date”) and will be applicable
pursuant to the terms of the Indenture (including in connection with performing any calculation or assessment to determine
compliance with the terms of the Indenture), unless and until the Senior Secured Notes subsequently attain Investment
Grade Status (in which event the Suspended Covenants shall no longer be in effect for such time that the Senior Secured
Notes maintain an Investment Grade Status); provided, however, that no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind
shall be deemed to exist under the Senior Secured Notes Documents with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on,
and none of the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries shall bear any liability with respect to such Suspended
Covenants for, any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time
pursuant to any contractual obligation arising prior to the Reversion Date, regardless of whether such actions or events
would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in effect during such period. The period of
time between the date of suspension of the covenants and the Reversion Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period.”

On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period (other than any Indebtedness
incurred under the ABL Facility) will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date so that it is classified as
permitted under clause (4)(a) of the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” On and after the Reversion Date,
all Liens created during the Suspension Period will be considered Permitted Liens pursuant to clause (11) of such definition.
Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under “—Limitation
_on Restricted Payments” will be made as though the covenants described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”_
had been in effect since the Issue Date and prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted
Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments
under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.
Any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any
Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under
clause (6) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.” Any encumbrance or restriction on the
ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Restrictions on
_Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have_
existed on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation
_on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.” On and after each Reversion Date, the Company and the_
Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during
the Suspension Period, so long as such contract and such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension
Period.

In addition, any future obligation to grant further Senior Secured Notes Guarantees shall be released. All such
further obligation to grant Senior Secured Notes Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date.

There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status.


-----

The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Senior Secured Notes, shall not be deemed to have
any knowledge of the ratings of the Senior Secured Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders of the Senior Secured
Notes achieve Investment Grade Status or upon the occurrence of the Reversion Date. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee
that the conditions under this covenant have been satisfied, although such notification shall not be a condition for
suspension of the applicable covenants to be effective.

**Limitation on Indebtedness**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (including
Acquired Indebtedness) and the Company will not issue Disqualified Stock and will not permit any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries to issue Preferred Stock; provided, however, (i) that the Company and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may
Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and the Company may issue Disqualified Stock and any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries may issue Preferred Stock, if on the date of such determination and after giving pro forma effect
thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company and
the Restricted Subsidiaries is at least 2.00 to 1.00; and (ii) the amount of Indebtedness Incurred and Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock issued pursuant to clause (i) above shall not cause the Non Guarantor Debt Cap to be exceeded.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness (collectively,
“Permitted Debt”):

(1) the Incurrence by the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness under any Credit
Facility (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit, guarantees and bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed the sum of:

(a) the aggregate of the greater of (x) $500.0 million and (y) the Borrowing Base; plus

(b) the maximum amount of Senior Secured Indebtedness such that after giving pro forma effect to
such Incurrence the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries do not exceed 4.00 to 1.00 (with any Indebtedness Incurred under
clause (a) above on the date of determination of the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage
Ratio not being included in the calculation of Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio
under this subclause (b) on such date of determination but not, for the avoidance of doubt,
excluded from any such calculation made on any such subsequent date); plus

(c) the maximum amount of Indebtedness that is not Senior Secured Indebtedness such that, on the
date of determination, after giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence, the Consolidated Total
Net Leverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries does not exceed 5.00 to
1.00 (with any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (a) above on the date of determination of the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio not being included in the calculation of Consolidated
Total Net Leverage Ratio under this clause (c) on such date of determination but not, for the
avoidance of doubt, excluded from any such calculation made on any such subsequent date),

_provided that (i) any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (1) may be refinanced at any time if_
such refinancing does not exceed the greater of (I) the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness
permitted to be Incurred pursuant to this clause (1) on the date of determination for such refinancing and
(II) the aggregate principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced at such time (together with an
amount necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses, including any premium
and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in
connection with such refinancing) and (ii) the amount of Indebtedness Incurred and Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock issued pursuant to clauses (1)(b) and (1)(c) shall not cause the Non Guarantor Debt
Cap to be exceeded;

(2) Guarantees by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other obligations of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness or other obligations
is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Company owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) Indebtedness represented by (a) Indebtedness, and any Guarantees thereof, in each case of the Company
and its Restricted Subsidiaries, outstanding on the Issue Date (or Incurred under a facility committed and
as in effect as of the Issue Date), including the Existing AMP Notes and the Existing Notes Guarantees,
(b)(i) the Senior Secured Notes (other than any Additional Senior Secured Notes), including any Senior


-----

Secured Notes Guarantee and (ii) any loans pursuant to which proceeds of any Indebtedness of a Parent
Entity that are lent to the Company, to the extent that such Indebtedness is Guaranteed by the Company
or any Restricted Subsidiary or is otherwise considered Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary, and such Guarantees or the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, as the case may be, as are not
prohibited by the Indenture, (c) Refinancing Indebtedness (including with respect to the Senior Secured
Notes and any Guarantee thereof) Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in this clause (4)
and clause (5)(b) of this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, and
(d) other Indebtedness Incurred to finance Management Advances;

(5) Indebtedness (x) of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurred or issued to finance an
acquisition (including an acquisition of any assets) or other transaction or (y) of Persons that are, or
secured by any assets that are, acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or merged into,
amalgamated or consolidated with the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms
of the Indenture; provided that (A) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (5) is in an aggregate
amount not to exceed (a) the greater of (i) $55.0 million and (ii) 10.0% of LTM EBITDA at the time of
Incurrence, _plus (b) unlimited additional Indebtedness to the extent that after giving effect to such_
acquisition, transaction, merger, amalgamation or consolidation and without giving effect to any
Indebtedness Incurred or issued pursuant to subclause (5)(A)(a) above on the date of determination,
either: (i) the Company would be permitted to Incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to
the first paragraph of this covenant and, if such Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, the
Company would be permitted to Incur at least $1.00 of additional Senior Secured Indebtedness pursuant
to clause (1)(b) of the second paragraph of this covenant, or (ii) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries would not be lower and, if such Indebtedness is Senior Secured
Indebtedness, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries would not be higher, in each case, than it was immediately prior to such acquisition, merger,
amalgamation or consolidation and (B) the amount of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to subclause (x)
of this clause (5) shall not cause the Non Guarantor Debt Cap to be exceeded;

(6) Hedging Obligations (excluding Hedging Obligations entered into for speculative purposes as
determined in good faith by the Company);

(7) Indebtedness (a) represented by Capitalized Lease Obligations, mortgage financings, Purchase Money

Indebtedness otherwise Incurred to finance the purchase, lease, rental or cost of design, construction,
installation or improvement of property (real or personal) or equipment that is used or useful in a Similar
Business, whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such
assets (provided that, in each case, the Indebtedness exists on the date of such purchase, lease, rental,
construction, design, installation or improvement or is created within 180 days thereafter), and any
Indebtedness which refinances, replaces or refunds such Indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding
principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred
pursuant to this clause (7)(a) and then outstanding, does not exceed the greater of (i) $300.0 million and
(ii) 65.0% of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect
thereof or (b) arising out of Sale and Leaseback Transactions;

to a Restricted Subsidiary) of its Subordinated Shareholder Funding or Capital Stock or otherwise
contributed to the equity (in each case, other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock, Designated
Preferred Stock, or an Excluded Contribution) of the Company, in each case, subsequent to the Issue
Date, and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof; provided, however, that (i) any such Net Cash
Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall not increase the amount available for making Restricted
Payments to the extent the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries Incur Indebtedness in reliance
thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes
of Incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause to the extent such Net Cash Proceeds or cash have been

Company or any Parent Entity that is permitted by the covenant described below under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments”;_

(13) Indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the principal
amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (13) and then outstanding, will not
exceed the greater of (a) $275.0 million and (b) 50.0% of LTM EBITDA; provided that the amount of

Indebtedness in respect thereof and the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to
this clause (18) and then outstanding, will not exceed the greater of (a) $135.0 million and (b) 25.0% of
LTM EBITDA.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) subject to clause (3) below, in the event that all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of
Permitted Debt or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company,
in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and
only be required to include, in any manner that complies with this covenant, the amount and type of such
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) in the first paragraph above
or one of the clauses of the second paragraph of this covenant, and Indebtedness permitted by this
covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but
may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this
covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(2) with respect to clauses (5)(a), (7), (11), (13) or (18) of the second paragraph of this covenant, if at any
time that the Company would be entitled to have Incurred any then outstanding item of Indebtedness
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or pursuant to clause (1)(b) or clause (1)(c) of the second
paragraph of this covenant, such item of Indebtedness shall (unless otherwise elected by the Company)
be automatically reclassified into an item of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this
covenant or pursuant to clause (1)(b) or clause (1)(c) of the second paragraph of this covenant, as
applicable;

(3) all Indebtedness under the ABL Facility Incurred as of the Issue Date shall be deemed to have been
Incurred pursuant to clause (1)(a) of the second paragraph of this covenant, and the Company shall not
be permitted to reclassify all or any portion of such Indebtedness;

(4) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under
a Credit Facility, re-borrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to “cash sweep” or “clean down”
provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to
be repaid periodically shall only be deemed for the purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on
the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent re-borrowing thereof;

(5) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such
Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest
and any fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts,
premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(6) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination
of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(7) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred
pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to any clause of the second
paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other
similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(8) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or


-----

repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation
preference thereof;

(9) in the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a
revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or commits to Incur
any Lien pursuant to clause (29) of the definition of “Permitted Liens,” the Incurrence or issuance thereof
for all purposes under the Indenture, including for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage
Ratio, as applicable, or usage of clauses (1) through (18) of the preceding paragraph (if any) for
borrowings and re-borrowings thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and
bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the Company’s option, either (a) be determined (i) on the date
of such revolving credit facility or such entry into or increase in commitments (assuming that the full
amount thereof (or, at the option of the Company, a portion thereof) has been borrowed as of such date)
or other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (in each case, pursuant to any letter,
agreement or instrument, which may be conditional, including as to documentation) and/or (ii) on the
date on which such facility or commitments become available, and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as
applicable, test or other provision of the Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any
borrowing or re-borrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’
acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage
Ratio, as applicable, or other provision of the Indenture at the time of any borrowing or re-borrowing (or
issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount
permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’
acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness
_Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior_
Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and, to the
extent of the usage of clauses (1) through (18) of the preceding paragraph (if any), shall be deemed to be
Incurred and outstanding under such clauses) or (b) be determined on the date such amount is borrowed
pursuant to any such facility or increased commitment, and in each case, the Company may revoke such
determination at any time and from time to time;

(10) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant
measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing
would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the
percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA
restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing
Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus
premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance, costs and fees in connection with such refinancing;
and

(11) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal
to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.

Accrual and/or capitalization of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or
amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of
dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments
or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness
for purposes of the covenant described under this _“Limitation on Indebtedness”;_ _provided that the amount of any_
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of any outstanding Indebtedness may (in the Company’s sole discretion) be increased
by the amount of all such accrued and/or capitalized interest, accreted value, original issue discount and/or additional
Indebtedness in respect of such Indebtedness and such increased amount will not be deemed to be Indebtedness for the
purpose of calculating any basket, permission or threshold under which such Refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be
Incurred.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be
Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Company shall be in
default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. Dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the U.S. Dollar equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be


-----

calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was first committed or first
Incurred (whichever yields the lower U.S. Dollar equivalent); provided that for the purpose of the Incurrence of any other
Indebtedness, the Company may elect to account for any such Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency at the
relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the determination date for the Incurrence of such other Indebtedness; provided,
_further, that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such_
refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. Dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. Dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed
not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (a) the
principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (b) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts,
accrued and unpaid interest, premiums (including tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including original issue
discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company
or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of
fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other
Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the
currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect
on the date of such refinancing.

thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments described in clauses (1) through
(22) above, and/or is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or constitutes a Permitted Investment,
the Company will be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) on the date of its
payment or later reclassify (based on circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment
or Investment (or portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant, including as a Permitted Investment.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such
Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment
shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment, property or assets other than cash
shall be determined conclusively by the Company acting in good faith.

**Limitation on Liens**


-----

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or
suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary), whether
owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien
is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not
constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Senior
Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Indenture are directly secured equally and ratably with, or
prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for
so long as such Indebtedness is so secured and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted
Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the
Indenture under clause (a)(2) in the preceding paragraph will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged
upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under the Indenture,
the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and/or under the relevant Security Documents.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness.
The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection
with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of
interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation
preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate
of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to create or otherwise cause or permit to
exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary
to:

(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) make any loans or advances to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(3) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends_
or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the application of any
standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness
Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the ABL Facility), (b) the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (c) the Existing AMP Indentures,
Existing AMP Notes or the Existing Notes Guarantees and (d) any other agreement or instrument, in
each case, in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured
Notes Guarantees or the Security Documents;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to applicable law, rule, regulation or order;

(4) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any
Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person was
acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or instrument is
assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other
than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the
funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such
Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Company or was merged, consolidated or
otherwise combined with or into the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or entered into in
contemplation of or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for


-----

the purposes of this clause, if another Person is the Successor Company (as defined below), any
Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed
acquired or assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the
Successor Company;

(5) any encumbrance, restriction or condition:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or
asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract or agreement, or the assignment or
transfer of any lease, license or other contract or agreement;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under the
Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under
the Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer or
encumbrance of the property or assets subject to such mortgages, pledges, charges or other
security agreements;

(c) contained in any trading, netting, operating, construction, service, supply, purchase, sale or other
agreement to which the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries is a party entered into in
the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice; provided that such agreement
prohibits the encumbrance of solely the property or assets of the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary that are the subject to such agreement, the payment rights arising thereunder or the
proceeds thereof and does not extend to any other asset or property of the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary or the assets or property of another Restricted Subsidiary; or

(d) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in
any reciprocal easement agreements of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease
Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on the
property so acquired;

(7) any encumbrance or restriction imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect
sale or disposition to a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are subject to such restriction) pending the
closing of such sale or disposition;

(8) customary provisions in leases, licenses, shareholder agreements, joint venture agreements and other
similar agreements, organizational documents and instruments;

(9) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule,
regulation, licensing requirement or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under
agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Hedging Obligations;

(12) restrictions created in connection with any Qualified Securitization Financing or Receivables Facility
that, in the good faith determination of the Company, are necessary or advisable to effect such
Securitization Facility or Receivables Facility;

(13) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a) relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions contained
in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders
(taken as a whole) than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in (A) the agreements, documents
and instruments entered into in connection with, or pursuant to, the ABL Facility, together with the
security documents associated therewith, and (B) the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in effect
on the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the
Company) and where, in the case of this sub-clause (ii), either (x) the Company determines at the time
of entry into such agreement or instrument that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely
affect, in any material respect, the Company’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Senior


-----

Secured Notes or (y) such encumbrance or restriction applies only during the continuance of a default
relating to such agreement or instrument, or (b) constituting an Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(14) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under “—Limitation on Liens”;
or

(15) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to
in clauses (1) to (14) of this paragraph or this clause (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any
amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clauses (1) to (14) of this
paragraph or this clause (15); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to
such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any
material respect to the Holders (taken as a whole) than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in
the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or
other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Company).

**Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition
unless:

(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by
way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or
otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date of
contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Company, of the
shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap or relates to Non-Core Assets), with a purchase price in excess of
the greater of (a) $40.0 million and (b) 7.5% of LTM EBITDA, at least 75% of the consideration from
such Asset Disposition (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility
for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as
the case may be, is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalents or Temporary Cash Investments; and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied:

(a) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is required
by the terms of any Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary), within 450 days
from the later of (1) the date of such Asset Disposition and (2) the receipt of such Net Available
Cash, (A) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Senior Secured Indebtedness of the Company
or a Restricted Subsidiary, including Indebtedness under any Credit Facility (including the ABL
Facility) (or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) or (B) prepay, repay, purchase or
redeem any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that is not a Guarantor or
any Indebtedness that is secured by Liens on assets which do not constitute Collateral (in each
case other than Subordinated Indebtedness of an Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to
the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary) _provided,_ _however, that, in connection with any_
prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (a), the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related
commitment (if any) to be reduced (including by a reduction in borrowing base or similar term
in conjunction with such Asset Sale or otherwise) in an amount equal to the principal amount
so prepaid, repaid, purchased or redeemed; provided further that to the extent the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary has elected to prepay, repay or purchase any amount of Senior
Secured Indebtedness at a price not less than par and has extended such offer to the Holders on
at least a _pro rata basis, to the extent the creditors in respect of such Senior Secured_
Indebtedness (including any Holders) elect not to tender their Senior Secured Indebtedness for
such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption, the Company will be deemed to have
applied an amount of Net Available Cash equal to such amount not tendered under this
paragraph (a), and such amount shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds; or

(b) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to invest
in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted
Subsidiary equal to the amount of Net Available Cash received by the Company or another


-----

Restricted Subsidiary) within 450 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition
and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that a binding agreement
shall be treated as a permitted application of Net Available Cash from the date of such
commitment with the good faith expectation that an amount equal to Net Available Cash will
be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an “Acceptable
_Commitment”) and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated_
for any reason before such amount is applied, then such Net Available Cash shall constitute
_Excess Proceeds,_

_provided further that, pending the final application of the amount of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with_
clause (a) or (b) above, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise
use such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that (x) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any
Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with
this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law (including financial assistance and corporate benefit
restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of the relevant directors) or (y) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available
Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to
comply with this covenant) could result in material adverse Tax consequences, as reasonably determined by the Company
in its sole discretion, the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance
with this covenant.

The amount of any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be
applied or invested as provided in the first paragraph of this covenant will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds”
under the Indenture; provided that, if at the time of any definitive agreement, put option or similar arrangement in respect
of any Asset Disposition or (at the option of the Company) the date on which Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition
is received, the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries is no greater than
4.50 to 1.00, 50.0% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition shall be deemed not to constitute Excess
Proceeds and may be used by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for any purpose not prohibited by the
Indenture. On the 451st day (or such longer period permitted by clause (3)(b) of the first paragraph of this covenant) after
the later of an Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds
under the Indenture exceeds the greater of $135.0 million and 25.0% of LTM EBITDA, the Company will be required to
make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) within 10 Business Days to all Holders under the Indenture and, to the extent the
Company elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to repay, prepay or purchase the maximum
aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition
Offer applies that may be repaid, prepaid or purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (and, in the case of any
Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness), in
each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repayment, prepayment or purchase,
in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as
applicable, and with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, in minimum denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples
of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Company will deliver notice of such Asset Disposition Offer electronically or by first-class
mail, with a copy to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the security
register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, as applicable, describing the transaction or
transactions that constitute the Asset Disposition and offering to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes for the specified
purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from
the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice. The
Company may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition by
making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to all Net Available Cash prior to the expiration of the relevant 450 days
(or such longer period as provided above) or with respect to any unapplied Excess Proceeds.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the Indenture. If the
aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other
Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the
Company shall allocate the Excess Proceeds among the Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid,
prepaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Senior Secured Notes
and Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided that the Company shall not be required to select and purchase Senior Secured Notes
or other Pari Passu Indebtedness in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the
amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes is denominated


-----

in a currency other than U.S. Dollars or Euro, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes shall not
exceed the net amount of funds in U.S. Dollars or Euro that is actually received by the Company upon converting such
portion into U.S. Dollars or Euro.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of an Issuer or a Guarantor)
and the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness or
other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from the
transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents
within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such
Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from
any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company (other than Subordinated Indebtedness)
received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in such
Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated
Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant during the same fiscal year, not to exceed
the greater of (a) $135.0 million and (b) 25.0% of LTM EBITDA (with the fair market value of each item
of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value).

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange
Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws, rules and
regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

Notwithstanding any other provision in the Indenture to the contrary, the provisions of the Indenture relative to
the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may
be waived or modified with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then
outstanding.

The agreements, documents and instruments entered into in connection with, or pursuant to, the ABL Facility may
prohibit, or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Company becomes a party may prohibit
or limit, the Company from purchasing any Senior Secured Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Company is
prohibited from purchasing the Senior Secured Notes, the Company could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase
of the Senior Secured Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company
does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Senior Secured Notes
under such instruments.

**Limitation on Affiliate Transactions**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to enter into or conduct any transaction or
series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service)
with any Affiliate of the Company (any such transaction or series of related transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”)
involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of (i) $55.0 million and (ii) 10.0% of LTM EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Company
or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such
transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
(a) $75.0 million and (b) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA, the terms of such Affiliate Transaction have been
approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (2) above if such


-----

Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors of the Company, if any.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Restricted Payments,” or any Permitted Investment;_

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or other
payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering
into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation arrangements,
options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary or
any Parent Entity, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans,
participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health,
insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or
arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants
approved by the Board of Directors of the Company, in each case in the ordinary course of business or
consistent with past practice;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any (a) transaction between or among the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes
a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries and
(b) merger, amalgamation or consolidation with any Parent Entity; provided that such Parent Entity shall
have no material liabilities and no material assets other than cash, Cash Equivalents and the Capital Stock
of the Company and such merger, amalgamation or consolidation is otherwise permitted under the
Indenture;

(5) the payment of compensation, fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities
(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on
behalf of, directors, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or employees of the Company, any
Parent Entity or any Restricted Subsidiary (whether directly or indirectly and including through any
Controlled Investment Affiliate of such directors, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or
employees);

(6) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries under
the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any
agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date, as these agreements and instruments may be
amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed or refinanced from time to time in accordance
with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders (taken as
a whole) in any material respect;

(7) any transaction with a Securitization Subsidiary effected as part of a Qualified Securitization Financing
or Receivables Facility, any disposition or repurchase of Securitization Assets, Receivables Assets or

(8) transactions with customers, clients, joint venture partners, suppliers, contractors, distributors or
purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary course of business or consistent
with past practice, which are fair to the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable
determination of the Board of Directors of the Company or the senior management of the Company or
the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably
have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Company or an Associate or similar entity which would constitute an
Affiliate Transaction solely (i) because the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in
or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity or (ii) due to the fact that a director of
such Person is also a director of the Company or any direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Company
(provided, however, that such director abstains from voting as a director of the Company or such direct
or indirect Parent Entity of the Company, as the case may be, on any matter involving such other Person);

(10) any (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preferred Stock)

the related obligations) in connection therewith or any contribution to capital of the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary and (b) amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to any Subordinated
Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable; provided that such Subordinated

payments by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or
indirectly, including through any Parent Entity) for financial advisory, financing, underwriting or

Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the requirements of
clause (1) of the preceding paragraph;

(15) the existence of, or the performance by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of its obligations under
the terms of, any equityholders agreement (including the AMP Transfer Transaction Documents and any
registration rights agreement or purchase agreements related thereto) to which it is party as of the Issue
Date, and any similar agreement that it may enter into thereafter; provided, however, that the existence

as determined in good faith by the Company;

(16) any purchases by the Company’s Affiliates of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of the Company or any
of the Restricted Subsidiaries the majority of which Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock is purchased by

respective Controlled Investment Affiliates or Immediate Family Members) of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its Parent Entities pursuant to any management equity plan or stock option plan or
any other management or employee benefit plan or agreement or any stock subscription or shareholder
agreement; and any employment agreements, stock option plans and other compensatory arrangements
(and any successor plans thereto) and any supplemental executive retirement benefit plans or

Controlled Investment Affiliates or Immediate Family Members) that are, in each case, approved by the
Company in good faith;

(19) employment and severance arrangements between the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries and their
respective officers, directors, contractors, consultants, distributors and employees in the ordinary course
of business or entered into in connection with or as a result of the AMP Transfer Transactions;

(20) any transition services arrangement, supply arrangement or similar arrangement entered into in
connection with or in contemplation of the disposition of assets or Capital Stock in any Restricted
Subsidiary permitted under “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or entered into with
any Business Successor, in each case, that the Company determines in good faith is either fair to the
Company or otherwise on customary terms for such type of arrangements in connection with similar
transactions;

(21) transactions entered into by an Unrestricted Subsidiary with an Affiliate prior to the day such Unrestricted
Subsidiary is re-designated as a Restricted Subsidiary as described under “—Designation of Restricted
_and Unrestricted Subsidiaries” and pledges of Capital Stock of Unrestricted Subsidiaries;_

(22) any lease entered into between the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as lessee, and any Affiliate of

other Person or a Restricted Subsidiary and any other Person with which the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries file a consolidated tax return or with which the Issuers are part of a consolidated
group for tax purposes or any tax advantageous group contribution made pursuant to applicable
legislation, provided, however, that any such payments do not exceed the amounts of such tax that would
have been payable by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis and the related
tax liabilities of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are relieved thereby.

**Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

The Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary and any Unrestricted
Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, if that designation would not cause a Default. If a Restricted
Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate fair market value of all outstanding Investments
owned by the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be
deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted
Payments pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or under one or more clauses
of the definition of “Permitted Investment”, as determined by the Company. That designation will only be permitted if the
Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an
Unrestricted Subsidiary.

If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any Indebtedness of
such Subsidiary will be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not


-----

permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Company
will be in default of such covenant.

If an Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated as a Restricted Subsidiary, that designation will be deemed to be an
Incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary,
and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Indebtedness” (including pursuant to clause (5) of the second paragraph thereof, treating such designation as_
an acquisition for the purpose of such clause), calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the
beginning of the Relevant Testing Period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence immediately
following such designation. Any such designation by the Company or the re-designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary to
a Restricted Subsidiary as contemplated hereby shall be evidenced to the Trustee on the date of such designation or
re-designation by filing with the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation or re-designation complies
with the preceding conditions.

**Reports**

So long as any Senior Secured Notes are outstanding, the Issuers will furnish to the Trustee the following reports
following the Issue Date:

(1) within 120 days after the end of each subsequent fiscal year of the Company, beginning with the fiscal
year ending December 31, 2021, annual reports (the “Annual Financial Statements”) containing: (i) the
audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as at the end of the most recent two fiscal years and
audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Company for the most recent
two fiscal years, including appropriate footnotes to such financial statements, for and as at the end of
such fiscal years and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (ii) an operating
and financial review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated
financial condition, results of operations, EBITDA and material changes in liquidity and capital resources
of the Company; (iii) unaudited _pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the_
Company, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or
recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to
which such annual report relates (unless such pro forma information has been provided in a previous
report pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below); provided that such pro forma financial information will be
provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense or burden, in which case the
Company will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials; and (iv) a brief
description of the business, management and shareholders of the Company, all material affiliate
transactions and a description of all material debt instruments; provided that the information described
in clause (iv) may be provided in the footnotes to the audited financial statements;

(2) within 60 days following the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the
Company, beginning with the first such fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2022, quarterly year-to-date
financial statements (the “Quarterly Financial Statements”) containing the following information: (i) the
Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such quarter and unaudited
condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter year to date period ending on
the unaudited condensed balance sheet date and the comparable prior period (other than any comparable
period falling prior to the Issue Date or that would require the creation of new consolidated financial
statements), together with condensed footnote disclosure; (ii) unaudited pro forma income statement and
balance sheet information of the Company, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material
acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently
completed fiscal year as to which such quarterly report relates; provided that such pro forma financial
information will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense or burden, in
which case the Company will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials;
and (iii) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion
of the consolidated financial condition, results of operations, EBITDA and material changes in liquidity
and capital resources of the Company; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Company announces publicly or any
acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the Company
and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a change in a senior executive officer of the
Company or a change in auditors of the Company, a report containing a description of such event.

In addition, the Company shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such parties,
any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long as the Senior
Secured Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not “affiliates” under the Securities


-----

Act.

All financial statement information (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the calculations made under any
incurrence covenant, which shall be prepared in accordance with the terms of the Indenture) shall be prepared in accordance
with IFRS as in effect, including, to the extent adopted at such time, the application of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts
_with Customers) and IFRS 16 (Leases) and any successor standard thereto (or any equivalent measure under GAAP), on_
the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis
for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports
set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that
applied to such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Company or any
disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in
this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to
GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity or business
acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20.0% of the Company’s LTM EBITDA (calculated (i) in the case of an
acquisition, including any pro forma adjustments in respect of such acquisition and (ii) in the case of a disposal, excluding
any pro forma adjustments in respect of such disposal) for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly
financial reports have been delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the Company,
then the Annual Financial Statements and Quarterly Financial Statements will include a reasonably detailed presentation,
either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations
of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Company.

In the event that (i) the Company becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by
Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Company elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would
satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Company) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act (other than the provision of GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and
procedures), for so long as it elects, the Company will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information,
documents and other reports that the Company is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a)
or 15(d).

All reports provided pursuant to this “Reports” covenant shall be in English, or with a certified English translation.

Subject to compliance with the next succeeding paragraph, for so long as the equity securities of the Company or
any Parent Entity (into which the financial results of the Company are consolidated) or IPO Entity are listed on the New
York Stock Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of Euronext, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the
Stockholm Stock Exchange, Euronext Dublin, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the Swiss Stock Exchange, the Main
Market of the London Stock Exchange or NASDAQ) (each a “Regulated Market”) and the Company or such Parent Entity
or IPO Entity is subject to the admission and disclosure standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to
trading on a Regulated Market, for so long as it elects, the Company will make available to the Trustee such annual reports,
information, documents and other reports that the Company or such Parent Entity or such IPO Entity is, or would be,
required to file with the applicable Regulated Market and within the deadlines specified by such Regulated Market pursuant
to such admission and disclosure standards. Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and provided that such
requirements require the Company or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual reports, information,
documents and other reports with the applicable Regulated Market, the Company will be deemed to have complied with
the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

The Company may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this covenant
by providing any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent Entity (into which the financial results of the
Company are consolidated) so long as such reports (if an annual, half yearly or quarterly report) (a) meet the requirements
(including as to content and time of delivery) of this covenant as if references to the Company therein were references to
such Parent Entity and (b) are accompanied by condensed consolidated financial information together with separate
columns for: (i) such Parent Entity; (ii) the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis; (iii) any other
Subsidiaries of any applicable Parent Entity that are not the Company or Subsidiaries of the Company on a combined basis;
(iv) consolidating adjustments; and (v) the total consolidated amounts, none of which shall be required to be audited. Upon
complying with the foregoing requirement, the Company will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained
in the preceding paragraphs. For the avoidance of doubt, only Indebtedness of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries
shall be taken into account when making any calculations required under the Indenture.


-----

**Impairment of Security Interest**

The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit
to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it
being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no
circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the
Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders, and the Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to,
grant to any Person other than the Security Agent or the ABL Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee, the Security
Agent and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as the case may be, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that
(i) the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise
modify or replace any Security Documents for the purposes of Incurring Permitted Collateral Liens, (ii) the Company and
the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any
Security Documents for the purposes of undertaking a Permitted Reorganization, (iii) the Collateral may be discharged and
released in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (iv) the applicable Security Documents may be amended from time to time to cure
any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, error or inconsistency therein and (v) the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries may amend the Security Interests in any manner that does not adversely affect Holders in any material respect;
_provided, however, that in the case of clause (i), (ii) and (v) above, the Security Documents may not be amended, extended,_
renewed, restated, supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any such
action, the Company delivers to the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee
from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release,
modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person, which confirms the
solvency of the Person granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the
Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or replaced are valid
Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or
Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
release, modification or replacement. In the event that the Company, or an applicable Restricted Subsidiary complies with
the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and
indemnifications) consent to any amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release or other modification
or replacement requested in accordance with this covenant without the need for instructions from any Holder.

**Additional Guarantees**

No Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding under the ABL Facility, any other Credit
Facility or any Public Debt, in each case of either Issuer or a Guarantor, unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a
Guarantor on the date on which the Guarantee of such other Indebtedness is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and
delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture substantially in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such
Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, which Senior Secured Notes Guarantee will be senior
to or pari passu in right of payment with, as applicable, such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other Indebtedness;
_provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become a Guarantor to the extent and for so_
long as the Incurrence of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or could give
rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent
preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or
regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or
(except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the
case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any
cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses.
At the option of the Company, any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the
extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to
fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or
similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable
law.

The preceding paragraph will not be applicable to any guarantees of any Restricted Subsidiary:

(i) existing on the Issue Date, guaranteeing Indebtedness under Credit Facilities permitted to be incurred
pursuant to clause (1)(a) or clause (14) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Indebtedness,” or guaranteeing Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount that is less_


-----

than the greater of (a) $100.0 million and (b) 20.0% of LTM EBITDA;

(ii) that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary if the guarantee was not incurred in
connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary; or

(iii) given to a bank or trust company having combined capital and surplus and undivided profits of not less
than €500,000,000, whose debt has a rating, at the time such guarantee was given, of at least BBB+ or
the equivalent thereof by S&P and at least Baa1 or the equivalent thereof by Moody’s, in connection
with the operation of cash management programs established for the Parent Guarantor’s benefit or that
of any Restricted Subsidiary.

Future Senior Secured Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under
“Senior Secured Notes Guarantees—Senior Secured Notes Guarantee Release.” The Trustee and the Security Agent shall
each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, reasonably requested by, and at the cost of, the Company to effectuate any release of
a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and
indemnifications.

The validity and enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability
of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors”—Risks Relating to Our Debt,
_the Notes and the Guarantees—Corporate benefit, capital maintenance laws and other limitations on the Guarantees and_
_the Security Interests may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes and the Security_
_Interests.”_

**Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Company, in connection with the Incurrence by the Company
or any Restricted Subsidiary of (x) any Indebtedness secured on Collateral or as otherwise required herein and (y) any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (x), the Company, the relevant
Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their
duly authorized representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement,
amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the
Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders (taken as a whole)), including substantially
the same terms with respect to release of Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests;
_provided that (1) such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or_
Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties,
liabilities, indemnities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (2) if more than one such intercreditor agreement is outstanding at any time,
the correlative terms of such intercreditor agreements must not conflict.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Company and without the consent of Holders, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of
any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred
by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness
ranking junior in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor
Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the obligations under the ABL Facility or Senior
Secured Notes (including any Additional Senior Secured Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the
Collateral to secure Additional Senior Secured Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof, (8) make any
other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect
or (9) make all necessary provisions to ensure that the Senior Secured Notes are secured by the relevant Liens over the
Collateral. The Company shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under
“Amendments and Waivers,” and the Company may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any
amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or,
in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities, indemnities or
immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment,


-----

repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the
Senior Secured Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, shall be deemed to have
agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein), and to have directed
the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal business
hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at our offices.

**Financial Calculations**

In the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (w) Incurs Indebtedness to finance an acquisition
(including an acquisition of assets) or other transaction or (x) assumes Indebtedness of Persons that are, or secured by
assets that are, acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or merged into, amalgamated or consolidated with,
the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or (y) commits to an acquisition or
transaction pursuant to which it may Incur Acquired Indebtedness or (z) is subject to a Change of Control, the date of
determination of LTM EBITDA, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio
or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall, at the option of the Company, be (a) the date that a
definitive agreement, put option or similar arrangement for such acquisition, transaction, merger, amalgamation,
consolidation or Change of Control is entered into and the LTM EBITDA, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated
Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall be calculated giving
_pro forma effect to such acquisition, Change of Control and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith_
(including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) consistent with the definitions of “LTM
_EBITDA”, “Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio” and “pro forma”, as applicable, and, for the avoidance of doubt, (A) if any such_
ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such ratio (including due to fluctuations in the Consolidated EBITDA of
the Company or the target company) at or prior to the consummation of the relevant acquisition or Change of Control, such
ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether
such acquisition and any related transactions are permitted hereunder and (B) such ratios shall not be tested at the time of
consummation of such acquisition, transaction, merger, amalgamation or consolidation; _provided that if the Company_
elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, put option or similar
arrangement, (i) any such transaction shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreement, put option or
similar arrangement is entered into and to be outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any ratios under the
Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the earlier of the date of consummation of such acquisition or the
date such agreement is terminated or expires without consummation of such acquisition and (ii) to the extent any covenant
baskets were utilized in satisfying any covenants, such baskets shall be deemed utilized until the earlier of the date of
consummation of such acquisition or the date such agreement is terminated or expires without consummation of such
acquisition, but any calculation of LTM EBITDA or Consolidated EBITDA for purposes of other Incurrences of
Indebtedness or Liens or making of Restricted Payments (not related to such acquisition) shall not reflect such acquisition
until it has been consummated unless such other Incurrence of Indebtedness or Liens is conditional or contingent on the
occurrence of such acquisition or Change of Control or (b) the date such Indebtedness is borrowed or assumed or such
Change of Control occurs;

**Merger and Consolidation**

The Company will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) will be (x) a Person organized
and existing under the laws of England and Wales, Germany, any member state of the European Union
or the European Economic Area, or the United States of America, any State of the United States or the
District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland or Australia or Bermuda
and (y) the Successor Company (if not the Company) will expressly assume, by supplemental indenture,
executed and delivered to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Company under the Senior Secured Notes
and the Indenture and all obligations of the Company under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the applicable Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the applicable Successor Company
as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the applicable Successor Company or such
Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default has occurred and is continuing;


-----

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Company or the applicable Successor
Company would be able to Incur at least an additional $1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first
paragraph of the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries would not be lower than
it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction;

(4) any Guarantor (other than the Company), unless it is the other party to the transactions described above,
will have by supplemental indenture confirmed that its Senior Secured Note Guarantee will apply to such
Person’s obligations under the Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes;

(5) the Company or the Successor Company, as the case may be, shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or
transfer and such supplemental indenture (in the case of a Successor Company) comply with the
Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (in the case of a
Successor Company) is a legal and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Company,
_provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any_
matters of fact, including as to satisfaction of clauses (1), (2) and (3) above; and

(6) the Holders (or the Security Agent on their behalf) will continue to have the same or substantially
equivalent (ignoring for the purposes of assessing such equivalency any limitations required in
accordance with the Agreed Security Principles or hardening periods) guarantees and security (if any)
over the same or substantially equivalent assets and over the shares (or other interests) in the Company
or the Successor Company, save to the extent such assets or shares (or other interests) cease to exist
(provided that if the shares (or other interests) in the Company cease to exist, security will be granted
(subject to the Agreed Security Principles) over the shares (or other interests) in the Successor Company).

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Company under the Senior Secured Notes and the Indenture.

The foregoing provisions shall not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or
substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Senior Secured Note when due and payable, continued for
30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior Secured Note when
due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or
otherwise;

(3) failure by either Issuer or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days after written notice by the Trustee on
behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Senior Secured Notes with any agreement or obligation contained in the Indenture, other than those set
out in clauses (1) or (2) above;

(4) the occurrence of any default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be
issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed which is
Incurred or Guaranteed by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary, other than Indebtedness owed to
the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, which:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after
giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (a “payment
_default”); or_

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the “cross
_acceleration provision”),_


-----

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal
amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default of principal at its
stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or the maturity of which has
been accelerated, is in excess of the greater of (x) $165.0 million and (y) 30.0% of LTM EBITDA;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Company, the Issuer or a Significant
Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Company, an Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in
excess of the greater of (x) $165.0 million and (y) 30.0% of LTM EBITDA, other than any judgments
covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies issued by, reputable and creditworthy
companies, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than
60 days (after receipt of notice as described in the next succeeding paragraph) after such judgment
becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has
been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed (the
“judgment default provision”);

(7) any Security Interest under the Security Documents having a fair market value in excess of the greater
of (x) $165.0 million and (y) 30.0% of LTM EBITDA shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and
effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) for any reason other than the
satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such Security Interest in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or the Security Documents or any such Security Interest created thereunder shall be declared
invalid or unenforceable or the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any
such Security Interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 30 days; and

(8) except as permitted under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (including with respect to any limitations), any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of one or
more Guarantors that together constitute a Significant Subsidiary (a “Significant Guarantor”) is held in
any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or ceases for any reason to be in full force and
effect, or is denied or disaffirmed by such Significant Guarantor or any Person acting on behalf of it.

However, a Default under clauses (4) or (6) of the above paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until
the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes notify
the Issuer of the Default and, with respect to clauses (4) and (6), the Company does not cure such Default within 60 days
after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the
Trustee by written notice to the Company or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Senior Secured Notes by written notice to the Issuers and the Trustee may, and the Trustee (subject to certain conditions)
at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Senior
Secured Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will
be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes because an Event
of Default described in clause (4) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration
of the Senior Secured Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event
of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the
Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after
the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes
would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to an Issuer occurs and is continuing, the principal
of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Senior Secured Notes will become and be immediately due and payable
without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may
not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Indenture may
waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest
or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Senior Secured Note held by a non-consenting Holder, which may only be waived
with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured


-----

Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Senior Secured Notes and its consequences (including the
payment default that resulted from such acceleration) if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a
court of competent jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default
for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely
because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the
failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to
deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the
delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery
is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request
or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to
the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of
principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes
unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have requested in
writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or indemnity
satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and
the security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have not given
the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within
such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured
Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to
the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which a
responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to
use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse
to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the
rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the
Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion
against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a responsible officer of the Trustee is
informed in writing of such occurrence by the Issuers, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within
60 days after being notified by the Issuers. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if
any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith
determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.

The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s
Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Company
is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is
aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in
respect thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Secured Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes)


-----

and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent
of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes). However, without
the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (9) below, 75%) of the then outstanding principal
amount of the Senior Secured Notes, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Senior Secured Notes held by
a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Senior Secured
Note (other than provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(2) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Senior Secured Note (other than
provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(3) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Senior Secured Note or change the time
at which any such Senior Secured Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under
“Optional Redemption” or “Redemption for Taxation Reasons”;

(4) make any such Senior Secured Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Senior Secured
Note;

(5) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of, or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes on or after the due dates
therefor;

(6) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “Withholding Taxes” that adversely
affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Secured Notes in any material respect or amends the terms
of such Senior Secured Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes
described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described
thereunder unless the applicable Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(7) release all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral
(taken as a whole) other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture (as applicable);
_provided that, for the avoidance of doubt and without prejudice to the covenant described under the_
heading “Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,” the release of less than all or
substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral (taken as a
whole) shall only require the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender
offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or
compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained
in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes);

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes
by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes and a waiver of
the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(9) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or the
Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(10) reduce the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes whose holders must consent to any amendment,
waiver or modification or make any other change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require
the Holders’ consent described in this sentence.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with, the covenants
described under “Certain Covenants” shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of Holders to receive payment of
principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Company, the Issuers, the Trustee and the
other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Senior Secured Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency;


-----

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuers or a Guarantor under
any Senior Secured Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right or
power conferred upon the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or make
any change (including changing the ISIN, CUSIP or other identifying number on any Senior Secured
Notes) that does not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee or any Holder in any material respect;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member
of senior management of the Company) for the issuance of Additional Senior Secured Notes that may be
issued in compliance with the Indenture;

(6) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenant described
under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “Certain Covenants—Additional
_Guarantees,” to add Senior Secured Notes Guarantees with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, to add_
security to or for the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release,
termination, discharge or retaking of any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Lien with respect to or
securing the Senior Secured Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is provided for
under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes to any provision of this “Description of
_the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Notes” was intended to be a_
verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Senior Secured Notes;

(8) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee pursuant to the
requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee to any Senior Secured Notes
Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a Security Interest in
favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or lenders under the ABL Facility, in any
property which is required by the Security Documents or the ABL Facility (as in effect on the Issue Date)
to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a Security Interest is required to be granted to the
Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a Security Interest in the Collateral for the benefit of
any Person; provided that the granting of such Security Interest is not prohibited by the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under
“Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with;

(10) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of Senior
Secured Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including to facilitate the issuance and administration of
Senior Secured Notes; provided, however, that (i) compliance with the Indenture as so amended would
not result in Senior Secured Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any other
applicable securities law and (ii) such amendment does not adversely affect the rights of Holders to
transfer Senior Secured Notes in any material respect;

(11) facilitate any transaction that complies with (a) the definition of “Permitted Reorganization” or (b) the
covenants described under the headings “Merger and Consolidation” and “Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” relating to mergers, consolidations and sales of_
assets; or

(12) as provided in “Certain Covenants—Intercreditor Agreements”.

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee (and the Security Agent, as applicable) shall be entitled
to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of
Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment of any Senior Secured Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed
amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder given in connection with a tender
of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender. The Indenture will not contain a


-----

covenant regulating the offer and/or payment of a consent fee to Holders.

**Defeasance**

The Issuers at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors under the Senior Secured
Notes Documents (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain
obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities
of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuers in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary
Senior Secured Notes, registrations of Senior Secured Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Secured Notes and
the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing,
if the Issuers exercise their legal defeasance option, the Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders
under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other
than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuers at any time may terminate their obligations and the obligations of the Restricted Subsidiaries under
the covenants described under “Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1), (2) and (5) of the first paragraph of “Merger
_and Consolidation”) and “Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under_
“Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the
bankruptcy provisions (other than with respect to the Issuers), the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and
the security default provisions described under “Events of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuers at their option at any time may exercise their legal defeasance option notwithstanding their prior
exercise of their covenant defeasance option. If the Issuers exercise their legal defeasance option, payment of the Senior
Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. If the
Issuers exercise their covenant defeasance option with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, payment of the Senior Secured
Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than clauses (1), (2) and (5) of
the first paragraph of “Merger and Consolidation”), (4), (5) (with respect only to the Issuers and Significant Subsidiaries
(or a group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) of the Issuer), (6), (7) or (8) under
“Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuers must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”)
with the Trustee cash in U.S. Dollars, U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof, for the payment of principal,
premium if any, and interest on the Senior Secured Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply
with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that beneficial
owners of Senior Secured Notes, will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the
same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit
and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must
be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income
tax law since the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Company; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating
to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to
surviving rights of transfer or exchange of the Senior Secured Notes and rights of the Trustee, as expressly provided for in
the Indenture) as to all Senior Secured Notes of a series issued thereunder when (1) either (a) all the Senior Secured Notes
of that series previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Senior Secured Notes and
certain Senior Secured Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been
released to the Issuers) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Senior Secured Notes of that series
not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable
at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements
satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the


-----

Issuers; (2) the Issuers have deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such other party as directed by the
Trustee), money in U.S. Dollars, U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount
sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Senior Secured Notes of that series not previously delivered
to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Senior
Secured Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the
Issuers have paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuers have delivered irrevocable
instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Senior Secured
Notes of that series at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuers have delivered to the
Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent under the “Satisfaction
_and Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied_
with; provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance
with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)). If requested in writing by the Issuers, the Trustee (or such other party as directed
by the Trustee) will distribute any amounts deposited to the Holders prior to Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the
case may be; provided, however, that the Holders shall have received at least three Business Days’ notice from the Issuers
of such earlier repayment date (which may be included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the
distribution and payment to Holders prior to the maturity or redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative
interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Company or any of its respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of either Issuer or any Guarantor under the Senior Secured
Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder
by accepting a Senior Secured Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Senior Secured Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the
U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee**

Citibank, N.A., London Branch is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that,
except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written
notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in such Indenture. During the existence of an
Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will exercise such
of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use
in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in
the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the
Issuers, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim
as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and
Subsidiaries.

The Indenture sets out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed and replaced. Such terms will
include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in principal amount
of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the
Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated or (b) becomes incapable of acting as
Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide
Holder for not less than 6 months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes and
expenses incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the
extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, notices of the Issuers with respect to the Senior Secured Notes will be sent
to the Exchange.

All notices to Holders will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their respective


-----

addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. For so long as any Senior Secured Notes are
represented by global Senior Secured Notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to DTC, which will give such notices
to the Holders of book-entry interests in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, delivery of which shall be
deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than
once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such notice
shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice
or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall
be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to
a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is
mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or communication
is given in via DTC, it is duly given on the day the notice is given to DTC.

**Prescription**

Claims against either Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or Additional
Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof.
Claims against either Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed
six years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Restrictions**

Any payment on account of an amount that is payable in U.S. Dollars with respect to the Senior Secured Notes
(the “Required Currency”) which is made to or for the account of any Holder or the Trustee in lawful currency of any other
jurisdiction (the “Other Currency”) whether as a result of any judgment or order or the enforcement thereof or the
realization of any security or the liquidation of any of the Issuers, Company or any other Guarantor shall constitute a
discharge of the Issuers’, Company’s or such Guarantor’s obligation under the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or, the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, as the case may be, only to the extent of the amount of the Required Currency which
such Holder or the Trustee could purchase in the New York foreign exchange markets with the amount of the Other
Currency in accordance with normal banking procedures at the rate of exchange prevailing on the first day (other than a
Saturday or Sunday) on which banks in New York, are generally open for business following receipt of the payment first
referred to above. If the amount of the Required Currency that could be so purchased is less than the amount of the Required
Currency originally due to such Holder or the Trustee, the Issuers, Company or such other Guarantor, as the case may be,
shall indemnify and save harmless such Holder or the Trustee, as applicable from and against all loss or damage arising
out of or as a result of such deficiency. This indemnity shall constitute an obligation separate and independent from the
other obligations contained in the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Secured Note Guarantees, shall give
rise to a separate and independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by the Trustee or any
Holder of a Senior Secured Note from time to time and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any judgment
or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an amount due hereunder or under any judgment or order.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any U.S.
Dollar-denominated restriction herein, the U.S. Dollar equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a
non-U.S. Dollar currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
non-U.S. Dollar amount is incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Senior Secured Notes on Euronext Dublin and for permission to be granted to
deal in the Senior Secured Notes on the Global Exchange Market thereof. There can be no assurance that the application
to list the Senior Secured Notes on the Exchange will be approved or that permission to deal in the Senior Secured Notes
thereon will be granted, and settlement of the Senior Secured Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing or
permission.

designate.

a specific payment of principal of or interest on any such U.S. Government Obligations held by such custodian for the
account of the holder of such depository receipt; provided that (except as required by law) such custodian is not authorized

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Notes sold to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A will be represented by a global note in registered form without
coupons attached (the “Rule 144A Global Note”). The Notes sold to persons outside the United States to non-U.S. persons
in reliance on Regulation S will be represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Regulation S Global Note”, and together with Rule 144A Global Note, the “Global Notes.”)

The Rule 144A Global Note and the Regulation S Global Note will be deposited with a custodian for, and
registered in the name of, Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Rule 144A Book-entry Interests”) and in the
Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-entry Interests” and, together with the Rule 144A Book-entry
Interests, the “Book-entry Interests”) will be limited to persons who have accounts with DTC, or persons who hold interests
through such participants. DTC will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’
securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositaries. Except under the limited
circumstances described below, Book-entry Interests will not be held in definitive certificated form.

Book-entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records maintained in the
book-entry form by DTC and its participants. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States,
may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive certificated form.
The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-entry Interests. In addition, while the
Notes are in global form, holders of Book-entry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes for any
purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, DTC (or its respective nominees), will be considered the sole holders
of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of DTC and
indirect participants must rely on the procedures of DTC and the participants through which they own Book-entry Interests,
to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture.

Neither we nor the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar nor any of their
respective agents will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-entry Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, DTC will redeem an equal amount of the
Book-entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note.
The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-entry Interests will be equal to the amount
received by DTC in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that,
under the existing practices of DTC, if fewer than all of Notes are to be redeemed at any time, DTC will credit their
respective participants’ accounts on a pro rata pass-through distribution of principal basis (with adjustments to prevent
fractions), or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate in accordance with the rules and procedures of DTC;
_provided, however, that no Book-entry Interest of less than $200,000 may be redeemed in part._

**Payments on Global Notes**

We will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if
any, and interest) to DTC or its nominee (in the case of the Rule 144A Global Note and the Regulation S Global Note),
which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their customary procedures. We will make payments
of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments
or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described under “Description of the
Notes—Withholding Taxes.” If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described
under “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes,” we will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order that
the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-entry Interests after such deduction or
withholding will equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global
Note or Book-entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. We expect that standing customer
instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-entry Interests held through
such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuers and the Trustee will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes
(e.g., DTC (or its nominee)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes.
Consequently, none of the Issuers, the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any of their


-----

respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records of DTC or any participant or
indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or
reviewing the records of DTC or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a
Book-entry Interest, or DTC or any participant or indirect participant.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Rule 144A
Global Note and the Regulation S Global Note, will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through DTC in U.S.
dollars.

**Action by Owners of Book-entry Interests**

DTC has advised the Issuers that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes (including the
presentation of Notes for exchange as described below) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account
the Book-entry Interests are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to
which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. DTC will not exercise any discretion in the granting
of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an Event of
Default under the Indenture, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for definitive registered notes in
certificated form (“Definitive Registered Notes”) and to distribute Definitive Registered Notes to its participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in
immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including
to sell Notes to persons in jurisdictions that require physical delivery of securities or to pledge such Notes, such holder
must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC and in accordance with
the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

The Global Notes for Rule 144A Book-entry Interests will have a legend to the effect set forth under “Notice to
Investors.” Book-entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification
requirements discussed under “Notice to Investors.”

Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the offering of the Notes and the
closing of the offering (the “Distribution Compliance Period”), Regulation S Book-entry Interests may be transferred to a
person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Rule 144A Global Note only if such transfer is made pursuant
to Rule 144A and the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect
that such transfer is being made to a person whom the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer”
within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with
the transfer restrictions described under “Notice to Investors” and in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the
states of the United States and other jurisdictions.

After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, Regulation S Book-entry Interests may be transferred
to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A Book-entry Interest without compliance with these certification
requirements.

Rule 144A Book-entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S
Book-entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture)
to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act or
any other exemption (if available under the U.S. Securities Act).

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-entry Interest for a Rule 144A
Book-entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S
Global Notes and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Notes.

Any Book-entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of a Book-entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-entry Interest in the first mentioned
Global Note and become a Book-entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all
transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long
as it remains such a Book-entry Interest.


-----

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered Notes:

      - if DTC notifies either Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary and a successor
depositary is not appointed by us within 120 days; or

      - if the owner of a Book-entry Interest requests such an exchange in writing delivered through DTC following
an Event of Default under the Indenture.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer
such Note by surrendering it to the registrar or transfer agent. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of a
holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will
be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance
of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable; provided that no
Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than $200,000 will be issued. We will bear the cost of preparing, printing,
packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes.

We will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a period of 15
calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the Notes, (ii) any date fixed for redemption of
the Notes or (iii) the date fixed for selection of the Notes to be redeemed in part. Also, we are not required to register the
transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for redemption. In the event of the transfer of any Definitive Registered Note,
the Trustee may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents as
described in the applicable Indenture. We may require a holder to pay any taxes and fees required by law and permitted by
the applicable Indenture and the Notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Note has
been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Note is mutilated and is surrendered to the
registrar or at the office of the transfer agent, we will issue and the Trustee, upon receipt of an authentication order, will
authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and our requirements are met. Either the Issuers or
the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond
sufficient in the judgment of both to protect us, the Trustee or the Principal Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the
Indenture governing the Notes from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The
Issuers may charge for any expenses incurred by us in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become
due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by either Issuer pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, such
Issuer, in its discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive
Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged only after the transferor first delivers to the Trustee
a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer
restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

So long as the Notes are listed on Euronext Dublin and the rules of such exchange so require, we will publish a
notice of any issuance of Definitive Registered Notes in a newspaper having general circulation in Ireland (which we expect
to be The Irish Times) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, posted on the official website of Euronext
Dublin (http://www.ise.ie).

**Information Concerning DTC**

DTC is:

      - a limited purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law;

      - a “banking organization” under the New York Banking Law;

      - a member of the Federal Reserve System;

      - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and

      - a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act.


-----

DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions
among its participants. It does this through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of securities participants,
eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC participants include securities brokers and
dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations such as the Initial Purchasers. Others,
such as banks, brokers, dealers, trust companies and clearing corporations, that clear through or maintain a custodial
relationship with a direct participant also have access to the DTC system and are known as indirect participants.

Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain
banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in
the DTC system or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate
for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive
form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of
beneficial interests through the DTC system will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Note only
through DTC participants.

The address of DTC in New York is 55 Water Street, New York, New York 10041.


-----

**TAXATION**

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisers as to the tax consequences, under
the tax laws of the country of which they are resident, of a purchase of Notes including, without limitation, the consequences
of receipt of interest and premium, if any, on sale or redemption of, the Notes or any interest therein.

References in this discussion to Notes acquired, owned, held or disposed of by Noteholders include, except where
otherwise expressly stated, the Book-entry Interests held by purchasers in the Notes in global form deposited with a
custodian for, and registered in the name of, Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC.

**Ireland Taxation**

Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance is a qualifying company pursuant to Section 110 of the Irish Taxes
Consolidation Act 1997 (as amended) (the “TCA 1997”).

The following general summary describes the material Irish tax consequences of ownership of the Notes where Ardagh
Metal Packaging Finance continues to qualify to be taxed in accordance with Section 110 TCA (which the Directors expect
to be the case). The summary is based on the Irish tax law and published practice of the Revenue Commissioners as in
effect on the date of this Offering Memorandum, both of which are subject to change possibly with retroactive effect.

The following summary does not purport to be a complete analysis of all Irish tax considerations relating to the
Notes. It relates to the position of persons who are absolute beneficial owners of the Notes and may not apply to certain
classes of persons such as financial institutions, dealers and certain tax-exempt bodies. Holders of the Notes are advised to
consult their own tax advisers regarding the taxation implications of acquiring, owning and disposing of the Notes.

**_Taxation of Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance_**

Profits arising to Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance are taxable at a rate of 25%. The rules applicable in order to
calculate this tax are generally the same as those applicable to a regular trading company except in relation to certain
payments of interest. Interest on the Notes will be deductible for Irish tax purposes, where certain conditions are met.

All expenses that are not capital in nature and which are incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of
Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance’s activities and which are not specifically prohibited by statute will be deductible from
income in order to determine taxable profits. Any losses incurred by Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance will be available for
set-off against its profits for any subsequent accounting period for so long as Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance is subject
to the Section 110 taxation regime.

**_Withholding Tax on Interest_**

In general, withholding tax at the standard rate of tax (currently 20%) must be deducted from Irish source interest
payments made by an Irish company. However, for so long as the Notes are listed on a recognized stock exchange such as
the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin and the Notes carry a right to interest, the Notes will constitute “quoted
Eurobonds”. Under Section 64 of the TCA 1997 no withholding for or on account of Irish income tax will be required to
be made on interest arising on quoted Eurobonds provided they meet the following criteria:

(a) they are held in a recognized clearing system;

(b) the interest is paid by or through a person who is not in Ireland; or

(c) the beneficial owner of the Notes is not resident in Ireland and has made all necessary declarations in the
prescribed form.

As the Notes will constitute “quoted Eurobonds” and meet the above criteria, there will be no requirement to
withhold tax.

There is also an exemption for interest paid by a qualifying company (within the meaning of Section 110 of the
TCA 1997) to a person who is resident in another EU Member State or a country with which Ireland has a tax treaty, except
in a case where the interest is paid to a company in relation to a business which that company carries on in Ireland through
a branch or agency. Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance has elected to be treated as such a qualifying company.

No Irish withholding tax is payable in respect of a repayment of any principal amount of the Notes. No Irish
withholding tax is payable in respect of interest that does not have an Irish source and does not arise to an Irish resident.


-----

**_Charge to Irish Tax_**

Persons (individuals and companies) tax resident in Ireland are generally liable to Irish tax on their worldwide
income, including any income from the Notes.

In the case of persons that are individuals, interest will be liable to income tax at the marginal rate (up to 40%).
Such income will also be liable to the Universal Social Charge at rates of up to 11% depending on the individual’s
circumstances. Irish Pay Related Social Insurance contributions may also be payable.

In the case of corporate entities, the rate of corporation tax applying to the interest income is 25% (unless the
income constitutes trading income).

Interest paid by an Irish resident company to persons resident outside Ireland and who are resident in a “relevant
territory” is exempt from Irish income tax where the Notes constitute “quoted Eurobonds”. A “relevant territory” for this
purpose is a Member State of the European Union (other than Ireland), or a territory with which Ireland has entered into a
double tax treaty.

Where interest is paid to or income, gains or discounts are realized by a person tax resident outside a relevant
territory, such Irish source income may be chargeable to Irish income tax. However, a company (wherever resident) under
the control of persons who are resident in a relevant territory and not under the control of Irish residents should not be
liable to Irish tax on interest arising on quoted Eurobonds. A company (wherever resident) whose principal class of shares
are quoted on a recognized stock exchange is also not taxable on such interest on quoted Eurobonds. Ireland operates a
self-assessment system in respect of income taxes, corporation taxes, social insurance and the universal social charge. Any
person with Irish source income which is chargeable to Irish income tax comes within the scope of that system and may
have to file a return. A person not tax resident in Ireland should not be liable to Irish tax on non-Irish source interest income.

**_Payments Under the Guarantee Arrangement_**

Any payments made by the Parent Guarantor under the Guarantee can be made without deduction of Irish
withholding tax where the Notes are quoted Eurobonds and meet the criteria set out above.

Such payments should not be subject to Irish tax in the hands of a recipient who is not tax resident in Ireland and
is resident in a relevant territory and where the amount received is not connected with a trade carried on in Ireland by the
recipient through a branch or agency. Persons who are resident outside a relevant territory and in receipt of such payments
may be chargeable to Irish tax. Any such person may come within the scope of the self-assessment system and may have
to file a return.

**_Encashment Tax_**

If the Principal Paying Agent is not in Ireland, which is the case, then there is no obligation to deduct encashment
tax. If a person in Ireland were to pay the interest or receive the interest on behalf of a third-party, then Irish encashment
tax (currently 25%) would apply to amounts belonging to Irish resident holders of the Notes, or non-Irish residents who
hold Notes and who had not completed the requisite non-resident declaration forms.

In general, an automatic exemption from encashment tax exists on foreign dividends belonging to the following
Irish resident persons:

(a) Revenue approved charities,

(b) Revenue approved pension schemes,

(c) ARF’s, AMRF’s & PRSA’s as defined in Sections 784A, Section 784C and Section 787A of the TCA 1997,

(d) Investment Undertakings within the meaning of Section 739B of the TCA 1997,

(e) Banks, Building Societies and Life-Assurance Companies,

(f) Credit Unions as defined in Sec 219A of the TCA 1997,

(g) A “qualifying company” within the meaning of Section 110 of the TCA 1997, and

(h) Companies.


-----

**_Deposit Interest Retention Tax_**

The interest on the Notes will not be liable to Deposit Interest Retention Tax.

**_Capital Gains Tax_**

In the case of a person who is either tax resident or ordinarily tax resident in Ireland, the disposal or redemption
of the Notes may be liable to Irish capital gains tax at a rate of 33%. If the person is neither resident nor ordinarily resident
in Ireland, such person will not be liable to Irish capital gains tax on the disposal or redemption of the Notes for so long as
the Notes are quoted on a stock exchange unless the Notes are situated in Ireland and have been used in or for the purposes
of a trade carried on by such person in Ireland through a branch or agency, or which were used or held or acquired for use
by or for the purposes of the branch or agency.

**_Capital Acquisitions Tax_**

A gift or inheritance of the Notes will be within the charge to capital acquisitions tax where the donor or the
beneficiary in relation to the gift/inheritance is tax resident or ordinarily tax resident in Ireland on the date of the gift or
inheritance, or if the Notes are regarded as property situated in Ireland. Registered instruments will be deemed to be situated
in Ireland if the register is located in Ireland at the time of the disposal or redemption. Special rules with regard to tax
residence apply where an individual is not domiciled in Ireland. Capital acquisitions tax is charged at a rate of 33% on the
taxable value of the gift or inheritance above a tax-free threshold.

**_Value Added Tax_**

There is no Irish Value Added Tax ( “VAT”) payable in respect of payments in consideration for the issue of the
Notes or for the transfer of the Notes.

**_Stamp Duty_**

_Issuance of Instruments_

No stamp duty arises on the issuance of the Notes.

_Transfer of Notes_

No stamp duty is chargeable on a transfer of the Notes as they meet the following conditions for exemption under
Irish tax legislation:

(a) they do not carry a right of conversion into stocks or marketable securities (other than loan capital) of a company
having a register in Ireland or into loan capital having such a right;

(b) they do not carry rights of the same kind as shares in the capital of the company, including rights such as voting
rights, a share in the profits or a share in the surplus upon liquidation;

(c) they are issued for a price which is not less than 90% of the nominal value; and

(d) they do not carry a right to a sum in respect of repayment or interest which is related to certain movements in an
index or indices specified in any instrument or other document relating to such loan capital.

**_FATCA and the CRS_**

_FATCA_

The U.S. developed an intergovernmental approach to the implementation of FATCA (as discussed in “United
States Federal Income Taxation – Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act” below), which is intended to reduce the burden
for Financial Institutions (“FIs”) of complying with FATCA. The Irish and U.S. governments signed an intergovernmental
agreement (“Irish IGA”) on December 12, 2012. Under the Irish IGA, information about relevant U.S. investors will be
provided on an annual basis by each Irish FI (unless the FI is exempted from the FATCA requirements) directly to the Irish
Revenue Commissioners, who will then provide such information to the U.S. tax authorities.

_CRS_


-----

The Common Reporting Standard (“CRS”) requires participating jurisdictions to exchange certain information
held by financial institutions regarding their non-resident customers. Over 100 jurisdictions, including Ireland, have
committed to exchanging information under the CRS and the first data exchanges took place in September 2017. CRS does
not impose any additional requirements to withhold tax on payments to investors.

_Reporting Obligations under FATCA and the CRS_

A common feature of both FATCA and the CRS is that entities that are classified as “Financial Institutions” are
required to identify their investors and in certain circumstances report information to their local tax authorities (for onward
reporting to overseas tax authorities, in the case of CRS, and for onward reporting to the U.S. tax authorities, in the case of
FATCA).

The Irish Revenue Commissioners have issued regulations and guidance notes making compliance with the Irish
provisions implementing CRS and FATCA mandatory. As a result, Irish entities that are classified as “Financial
Institutions” in accordance with FATCA and CRS have obligations in respect of the Irish law implementing CRS and
FATCA.

On the basis that Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance does not fall within the definition of “Financial Institution”
for FATCA and CRS purposes, it should not have any reporting obligations under FATCA or CRS. However, there may
be still FATCA or CRS reporting applicable to the Notes by persons other than Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance but this
will be dependent upon various factors such as the entities from which the Noteholders will directly receive interest on the
Notes, the rules applicable in the jurisdictions of these entities, where the ultimate beneficial owners of the Notes are
resident and their FATCA and CRS status.

**_Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive_**

The Council of the European Union adopted two Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives (the “EU ATADs”) which
require all EU member states to introduce a number of anti-tax avoidance measures.

The EU ATADs contain various measures that could potentially result in certain payments made by Ardagh Metal
Packaging Finance not being fully tax deductible. This could increase Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance’s liability to tax
and reduce the amounts available for payments on the Notes. There are two measures of particular relevance.

The “Interest Limitation Rule” which restricts the tax-deductible interest of an entity. Ireland implemented the
Interest Limitation Rule in its Finance Act 2021 to apply to companies with respect to accounting periods commencing on
or after 1 January 2022. The Interest Limitation Rule provides that where an entity has exceeding borrowing costs (defined
below) of more than EUR 3,000,000 in respect of an accounting period of 12 months, its exceeding borrowing costs in
excess of 30% of its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation will not be deductible in the year in which
they are incurred but would remain available for carry forward, subject to certain conditions. For these purposes, exceeding
borrowing costs mean the amount by which an entity’s borrowing costs exceed interest revenues and other economically
equivalent taxable revenues. Where Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance uses its share of the proceeds of the Notes to lend to
group companies, which is expected to be the case, it is expected that it should not have exceeding borrowing costs and,
thus it is expected that the Interest Limitation Rule should have limited impact, if any.

The “Anti- Hybrid Rules” which are designed to neutralise arrangements where amounts are deductible from the
income of one entity but are not taxable for another, or the same amounts are deductible for two entities. These rules could
potentially apply to Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance where (a) the interest that Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance pays
under the Notes, and claims deductions from the relevant taxable income for, is not brought into account as taxable income
by the relevant Noteholder either because of the characterisation of the Notes, or because of the nature of the Noteholder
itself and (b) the mismatch arises between Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance and an associated enterprise or under a
structured arrangement.

For the purposes of the Anti-Hybrid Rules, a structured arrangement is one involving a mismatch outcome where
the mismatch outcome is priced into the terms of the arrangement or the arrangement was designed to give rise to a
mismatch outcome. The Directors do not expect that the Company should enter into a structured arrangement.

Entities are associated for these purposes where there is a direct or indirect participation in terms of voting rights
or capital ownership of 25 per cent. or more or an entitlement to receive 25 per cent. or more (50 per cent. in certain
circumstances) of the profits of that entity as well as entities that are part of the same consolidated group for financial
accounting purposes or enterprises that have a significant influence in the management of the taxpayer. In this context,
“significant influence” means an ability to participate, on the board of directors of Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance, in the
financial and operating policy decisions of Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance, including where that power does not extend
to control or joint control of Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance.

Even if Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance has or had at any time, an associated enterprise that is or was since 1


-----

January 2020 beneficially entitled to payments on the Notes, the measures should not impact those payments on the Notes
unless there is also a hybrid mismatch with respect to those payments.

**Luxembourg Taxation**

The following summary is of a general nature and is included herein solely for information purposes.

It is based on the laws presently in force in Luxembourg, though it is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be,
legal or tax advice. Prospective investors in the Notes should therefore consult their own professional advisers as to the
effects of state, local or foreign laws, including Luxembourg tax law, to which they may be subject. In particular, the
summary does not take account of the application of any double taxation treaty that may apply in any given situation.

Please be aware that the residence concept used under the respective headings below applies for Luxembourg
income tax assessment purposes only. Any reference in this section to a tax, duty, levy, impost or other charge or
withholding of a similar nature refers to Luxembourg tax law and/or concepts only. Also, please note that a reference to
Luxembourg income tax encompasses corporate income tax (impôt sur le revenu des collectivités), municipal business tax
(impôt commercial communal), a solidarity surcharge (contribution au fonds pour l’emploi) as well as personal income tax
(impôt sur le revenu) generally. Investors may further be subject to net wealth tax (impôt sur la fortune) as well as other
duties, levies or taxes. Corporate income tax, municipal business tax, net wealth tax as well as the solidarity surcharge
invariably apply to most corporate taxpayers resident in Luxembourg for tax purposes. Individual taxpayers are generally
subject to personal income tax and the solidarity surcharge. Under certain circumstances, where an individual taxpayer acts
in the course of the management of a professional or business undertaking, municipal business tax may apply as well.

**_Taxation of the Holders of Notes_**

_Withholding Tax_

Except as provided for by the Luxembourg law of 23 December 2005 (the ‘‘Law of 23 December 2005’’)
introducing a domestic withholding tax on certain interest payments to Luxembourg resident individuals, under the existing
laws of Luxembourg there is no withholding tax on payments of principal, premium or interest, or on accrued but unpaid
interest, in respect of the Notes, nor is any Luxembourg withholding tax payable upon redemption or repurchase of the
Notes. If a Noteholder is an associated enterprise of the payer of an amount under the Notes, additional rules may apply.

According to the Law of 23 December 2005, interest payments on the Notes paid by a paying agent established
in Luxembourg would be subject to a compulsory withholding tax of 20% (the ‘‘20% withholding tax’’) if such payments
are made for the immediate benefit of individuals resident in Luxembourg. The 20% withholding tax is levied by the
aforementioned paying agent.

In the event that interest is paid to a Luxembourg resident individual by a paying agent established in an EU
Member State other than Luxembourg, or in an EEA State, the beneficiary may opt for the application of the 20%
withholding tax in accordance with the Law of 23 December 2005 (the ‘‘20% tax’’). The 20% tax is paid and declared by
the beneficiary.

The 20% withholding tax and the 20% tax will operate a full discharge of income tax for Luxembourg resident
individuals acting in the context of the management of their private wealth. As of 1 January 2015, all interest payments
made or ascribed by a Luxembourg paying agent to or for the immediate benefit of individuals resident in a Member State
are subject to the automatic exchange of information between Luxembourg and the relevant Member States.

**_Income Taxation_**

_Non-Luxembourg Tax Resident Holders of Notes_

A non-Luxembourg tax resident holder of Notes, not having a permanent establishment or a permanent
representative in Luxembourg to which such Notes are attributable, is not subject to Luxembourg income tax on interest
accrued or received, redemption premiums or issue discounts, under the Notes. A gain realized by such non-resident holder
of Notes on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes is further not subject to Luxembourg income tax to
the extent the Notes are not attributable to a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in Luxembourg.

A non-Luxembourg tax resident corporate holder of Notes or an individual holder of Notes acting in the course
of the management of a professional or business undertaking, who has a permanent establishment or a permanent
representative in Luxembourg to which such Notes are attributable, is subject to Luxembourg income tax on interest
accrued or received, redemption premiums or issue discounts, under the Notes and on any gains realized upon the sale or
disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes.

_Luxembourg Tax Resident Holders of Notes_


-----

A corporate holder of Notes tax resident in Luxembourg must include any interest accrued or received, any
redemption premium or issue discount, as well as any gain realized on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the
Notes, in its taxable income for Luxembourg income tax assessment purposes. The same inclusion applies to an individual
holder of Notes, acting in the course of the management of a professional or business undertaking.

A holder of Notes that is governed by the law of May 11, 2007 organizing private family asset holding companies
(Société de Gestion de Patrimoine Familial), or by the law of December 17, 2010 on undertakings for collective investment
(Organismes de Placement Collectif), or by the law of February 13, 2007 on specialised investment funds (Fonds
_d’Investissement Spécialisé or SIF), or by the law of July 23, 2016 on reserved alternative investment funds (Fonds_
_d’Investissement Alternatif Réservé or RAIF), is neither subject to Luxembourg income tax in respect of interest accrued_
or received, any redemption premium or issue discount, nor on gains realized on the sale or disposal, in any form
whatsoever, of the Notes. A Société de Gestion de Patrimoine Familial is however subject to subscription tax at the annual
rate of 0.25% (the minimum subscription tax amounts to EUR 100 and the maximum to EUR 125,000). A SIF and a RAIF
are subject to subscription tax at an annual rate of 0.01%. A Holder of Notes that is governed by the law of July 13, 2005
(SEPCAV & ASSEP), as amended, is subject to Luxembourg income tax, but there are exemptions available for certain
kinds of income.

An individual Luxembourg tax resident holder of Notes, acting in the course of the management of his/her private
wealth, is subject to Luxembourg income tax in respect of interest received, redemption premiums or issue discounts, under
the Notes, except if withholding tax has been levied on such payments in accordance with the Law of December 23, 2005
(as this withholding tax would represent the final tax liability in his/her hands). A gain realized by a Luxembourg tax
resident individual holder of Notes, acting in the course of the management of his/her private wealth, upon the sale or
disposal, in any form whatsoever, of Notes is not subject to Luxembourg income tax, provided this sale or disposal took
place more than six months after the Notes were acquired. However, any portion of such gain corresponding to accrued
but unpaid interest income is subject to Luxembourg income tax (in case it would not have suffered the 20% withholding
tax under the Law of December 23, 2005).

In addition, pursuant to the Luxembourg law of July 17, 2008 (as amended), amending the law of December 23,
2005, Luxembourg tax resident individuals, acting in the course of management of their private wealth, can opt to selfdeclare and pay a 20% tax on interest payments made after December 31, 2007 by certain paying agents located in an EU
Member State other than Luxembourg or in a member state of the European Economic Area. If this option is exercised,
such interest does not need to be reported in the annual personal income tax return.

**_Net Wealth Taxation_**

A corporate holder of Notes, if it is resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes or, if not, where it maintains a
permanent establishment or a permanent representative in Luxembourg to which such Notes are attributable, is subject to
Luxembourg net wealth tax on the fair value of such Notes, except if the holder of such Notes is governed by the law of
May 11, 2007 organizing private family asset holding companies (Société de Gestion de Patrimoine Familial), or by the
law of December 17, 2010 on undertakings for collective investment (Organismes de Placement Collectif), or by the law
of or February 13, 2007 on specialised investment funds (Fonds d’Investissement Spécialisé or SIF), or by the law of July
23, 2016 on reserved alternative investment funds (Fonds d’Investissement Alternatif Réservé or RAIF), as amended, or
the law of July 13, 2005 on SEPCAV & ASSEP, or is a securitization company governed by the law of March 22, 2004 on
securitization, or is a company governed by the law of June 15 2004 relating to the investment company in risk capital
(Société d’Investissement en Capital à Risque or SICAR). There is, however, a minimum net wealth tax applicable to (i)
the securitization companies governed by the law of March 22, 2004 on securitization, (ii) companies governed by the law
of June 15, 2004 relating to the investment company in risk capital, (iii) a SEPCAV, (iv) an ASSEP, and (v) a RAIF that
opts for the SICAR regime.

**_Other Taxes_**

Neither the issuance nor the transfer of Notes will give rise to any Luxembourg stamp duty, capital duty, value
added tax, issuance tax, registration tax, transfer tax or similar taxes or duties, provided that the relevant issue or transfer
agreement is not submitted to registration (directly or as an annex) in Luxembourg. Registration upon issuance or transfer
of the Notes is not mandatory.

However, a registration duty may be due in the case where (i) any document in relation to the Notes amongst other
issue or transfer agreement, is either enclosed (annexé) to a deed subject to a mandatory registration in Luxembourg (e.g.,
public deed) or lodged with a notary’s records (déposé au rang des minutes d’un notaire), or (ii) a registration of the Notes
or any document in relation therewith (e.g., issue or transfer agreement) is made on a voluntary basis. Depending on the
nature of the documents, an ad valorem or a fixed registration duty may be due. Generally, under the current Luxembourg
administrative practice, no ad valorem registration duties are levied on the transfer of a bond or any other negotiable
security (excluding a transfer of interest in a partnership holding Luxembourg real estate property).


-----

In the event the Notes are presented voluntarily or mandatorily to a Luxembourg Court or to an ‘autoritée
constituée’, registration may be required, which is subject to registration duty on the document. Depending on the nature
of the documents, the registration of the Notes would be subject to an _ad valorem_ registration duty of 0.24 per cent,
calculated on the amounts mentioned therein. If the Notes are annexed or referred to in a deed signed before a Luxembourg
notary public that will be registered, the Luxembourg authorities may decide to levy the 0.24 per cent duty if the conditions
to levy the duty are fulfilled.

Where a holder of Notes is a resident of Luxembourg for tax purposes at the time of his/her death, the Notes are
included in his/her taxable estate for inheritance tax assessment purposes.

Gift tax may be due on a gift or donation of Notes if embodied in a Luxembourg deed or recorded in Luxembourg.

Subscription tax implications may arise (depending on the facts and circumstances) for the following Luxembourg
based entities:

- private family asset holding companies (Société de Gestion de Patrimoine Familial) governed by the law of
May 11, 2007; or

- investment funds governed by the laws of December 17, 2010, of February 13, 2007 and of July 23, 2016
(unless the RAIF opts for the SICAR regime). For investment funds, the subscription tax is levied on the total
net assets of the fund evaluated on the last day of each quarter. The tax is payable quarterly on a pro-rata basis.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Pursuant to certain provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, commonly known as FATCA, a
‘‘foreign financial institution’’ may be required to withhold on certain payments they make (‘‘foreign passthru payments’’)
to persons that fail to meet certain certification, reporting, or related requirements.

A number of jurisdictions (including Luxembourg) have entered into intergovernmental agreements with the
United States to implement FATCA (‘‘IGAs’’), which modify the way in which FATCA applies in their jurisdiction. Under
the provisions of IGAs as currently in effect, a foreign financial institution in an IGA jurisdiction would generally not be
required under FATCA or an IGA to make a FATCA withholding from payments that it makes. Certain aspects of the
application of the FATCA provisions and IGAs to instruments such as the Notes, including whether withholding would
ever be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as the Notes, are uncertain
and may be subject to change. Even if withholding were required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments
on instruments such as the Notes, such withholding would apply no earlier than two years after issuance of final regulations
by the IRS defining the term “foreign passthru payment”.

A foreign financial institution resident in an IGA jurisdiction must comply with specific due diligence procedures
to identify its account holders and provide the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (directly or indirectly through its local tax
authority) with information on financial accounts held by U.S. persons and recalcitrant account holders.

Consequently, holders of the Notes may be requested to provide certain information and certifications to any
financial institutions through which payments on the Notes are made.

Holders of the Notes should consult their professional advisors on the individual impact of FATCA.

**_Automatic Exchange of Information_**

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (‘‘OECD’’) has developed a common reporting
standard (‘‘CRS’’) to achieve a comprehensive and multilateral automatic exchange of information on a global basis. A
number of jurisdictions (including Luxembourg) signed the OECD’s multilateral competent authority agreement
(‘‘Agreement’’) to automatically exchange information under the CRS. The CRS was implemented in the European Union
via Council Directive 2014/107/EU of 9 December 2014 amending Directive 2011/16/EU as regards mandatory automatic
exchange of information in the field of taxation, which itself was implemented in the national laws of each EU member
state (including Luxembourg).

The CRS requires certain financial institutions to report information regarding certain accounts (which may
include the Notes credited to such accounts) to their local tax authority and follow related due diligence procedures. A
jurisdiction that has signed the Agreement may provide this information to other jurisdictions that have signed the
Agreement.

Consequently, holders of the Notes may be requested to provide certain information and certifications to any
financial institutions through which payments on the Notes are made.


-----

Holders of Notes should consult their professional advisors on the individual impact of CRS.

**Investors should consult their professional advisors on the possible tax and other consequences with respect to the**
**implementation of the CRS.**

**United States Federal Income Taxation**

The following summary describes certain U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant with respect
to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Notes. This summary applies only to holders who purchase Notes for cash
in this offering at their “issue price” (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money to
investors (not including bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters,
placement agents or wholesalers)) indicated on the cover of this Offering Memorandum and who will hold the Notes as
capital assets. It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations that may be relevant to a
decision to purchase the Notes. In particular, this summary does not address tax considerations applicable to holders that
may be subject to special tax rules including, without limitation, the following: (i) banks or other financial institutions;
(ii) insurance companies; (iii) dealers or traders in securities or currencies; (iv) tax exempt entities; (v) persons who will
hold Notes as part of a “hedging” or “conversion” transaction or as a position in a “straddle” or as part of a “synthetic
security” or other integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes; (vi) U.S. Holders (as defined below) who
have a “functional currency” other than the U.S. dollar; (vii) regulated investment companies; (viii) partnerships and other
pass-through entities (and investors therein); (ix) persons who have ceased to be U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents
of the United States; (x) U.S. Holders who hold Notes through a non-U.S. broker or other non-U.S. intermediary; and
(xi) persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being
taken into account in an “applicable financial statement” (as defined in Section 451 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)). Further, this summary does not address alternative minimum tax consequences or any
U.S. federal tax consequences other than U.S. federal income tax consequences (such as, U.S. federal estate and gift tax
consequences, or the Medicare tax on certain investment income) or any U.S. state and local or foreign tax consequences
of acquiring, owning or disposing of Notes.

This summary is based on the Code and U.S. Treasury regulations and judicial and administrative interpretations
thereof, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. All of the foregoing are subject to change, which change could apply
retroactively and could affect the tax consequences described below.

For purposes of this summary, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes: (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation, or other entity treated as a
corporation, created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia; (iii) an
estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust if (1) a court
within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S.
persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) the trust was in existence on August 20,
1996 and has properly elected to continue to be treated as a U.S. person.

For purposes of this summary, a “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is neither a U.S. Holder
nor a partnership (or other entity or arrangement that is treated as a partnership) for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or other pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax
purposes holds Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in or owner of the partnership or other pass-through entity generally
will depend upon the status of the partner or owner and the activities of the entity. A person that is a partner in a partnership
or other pass-through entity that is considering investing in Notes should consult its own tax adviser.

Each prospective investor should consult its own tax adviser with respect to the U.S. federal (including income,
Medicare, estate and gift), state, local and foreign tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of Notes. Holders
should also review the discussions under “Ireland Taxation” and “Luxembourg Taxation” for the Irish tax consequences
and Luxembourg tax consequences, respectively, to a holder of the ownership of Notes.

In certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of stated principal on the Notes or retire
the Notes before their stated maturity dates. See, e.g., “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.” Notwithstanding
these possibilities, we do not believe that any of the Notes are contingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, and, consequently, we do not intend to treat the Notes as contingent payment debt instruments. If,
notwithstanding our view, any of the Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, a U.S. Holder generally
would be required to accrue ordinary income at a rate in excess of the stated interest rate on such Notes and to treat as
ordinary income (rather than capital gain) any gain recognized on a sale or other taxable disposition of such Notes. The
remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.


-----

**_Source of Interest Payments_**

For certain U.S. federal income tax purposes (including for purposes of the foreign tax credit rules and the
withholding tax rules (including FATCA), as discussed below), the source of the interest income received by a holder with
respect to the Notes should depend on which Issuer makes the interest payment. However, the clearing systems require us
to designate only one Issuer for U.S. federal withholding tax purposes, and we intend to designate Ardagh Metal Packaging
Finance USA as the issuer of the Notes for this purpose. Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance USA is a Delaware limited
liability company that is treated as an entity disregarded as separate from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Accordingly, the regarded owner of Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance USA, Ardagh Metal Beverage USA Inc., would be
treated as the issuer of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As such, an applicable withholding agent likely will
treat all interest payments on the Notes as U.S. source income for U.S. federal withholding tax purposes.

**_U.S. Holders_**

_Payments of Stated Interest_

Stated interest paid on a Note generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary interest income at the time it
is received or accrued, depending on the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

For most U.S. Holders, interest income with respect to the Notes will constitute “passive category” income, which
may be relevant in calculating the U.S. Holder’s foreign tax credit limitation. The rules governing foreign tax credits are
complex and, therefore, U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the availability of foreign tax credits
in their particular circumstances.

_Original issue discount_

The Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the
stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their “issue price” by an amount equal to or more than a statutorily defined
_de minimis amount, the Notes will be issued by OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and a U.S. Holder will be_
required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) as it accrues (on a constant yield to maturity basis) for
U.S. federal income tax purposes in advance of the receipt of the cash payments to which such OID is attributable,
regardless of such U.S. Holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under these rules, a
U.S. Holder generally will have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual periods.
The rules governing OID instruments are complex, and, therefore, U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors
regarding the application of such rules to the Notes. The remainder of this discussion of “United States Federal Income
Taxation” assumes that the Notes will not be issued with OID.

_Disposition of a Note_

Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder generally
will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized on such disposition (except
to the extent any amount realized is attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which is taxable as described under
“—Payments of Stated Interest”) and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note.

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will be the cost at which the U.S. Holder acquires such Note. The
amount realized on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note will include the amount
of any cash and the fair market value of any property received for such Note.

Any gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder on the disposition of a Note will be U.S. source capital gain or loss and
will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the Note has been held for more than one year at the time of the disposition
of the Note. For certain non-corporate holders (including individuals), any such long-term capital gain is subject to U.S.
federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

_Foreign Financial Asset Reporting_

Certain U.S. Holders may be required to report information relating to an interest in the Notes, subject to certain
exceptions (including an exception for Notes held in accounts maintained by certain U.S. financial institutions). U.S.
Holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the effect, if any, of this legislation on their ownership and
disposition of the Notes including the significant penalties for non-compliance with this requirement.


-----

_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_

In general, information reporting requirements may apply to certain payments to a U.S. Holder of interest on the
Notes and to the proceeds of a sale, exchange or other taxable disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a Note.
Backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) may be required on such amounts if the U.S. Holder fails to (i) furnish the
U.S. Holder’s taxpayer identification number, (ii) certify that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding as a
result of a prior failure to report interest or dividends or (iii) otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of the
backup withholding rules. Certain exempt U.S. Holders (including, among others, corporations) are not subject to the
backup withholding and information reporting requirements.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a
payment to a U.S. Holder generally may be claimed as a credit against such U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability
(if any) and any excess may result in a refund, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely
manner.

**_Non-U.S. Holders_**

_Payments of Stated Interest_

As discussed above under “—Source of Interest Payments,” an applicable withholding agent likely will treat all
payments on the Notes as U.S. source.

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding and FATCA below, to the extent that payments of interest on the
Notes are treated as paid from U.S. sources for U.S. federal income tax purposes, neither U.S. federal income tax nor the 30%
U.S. federal withholding tax on U.S. source interest will apply to any payment of interest on a Note to a Non-U.S. Holder
provided that:

- interest paid on the Note is not effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in
the United States;

- the Non-U.S. Holder does not actually or constructively own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all
classes of Ardagh Metal Beverage USA Inc. stock that are entitled to vote within the meaning of section 871(h)(3)
of the Code;

- the Non-U.S. Holder is not a bank whose receipt of interest on a Note is described in section 881(c)(3)(A) of the
Code;

- the Non-U.S. Holder is not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to Ardagh Metal Beverage USA Inc.
(actually or constructively) through stock ownership; and

- (1) the Non-U.S. Holder provides its name and address, and certifies, under penalties of perjury, that it is not a U.S.
person (which certification may be made on an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, or other applicable
form) or (2) the Non-U.S. Holder holds the Note through certain foreign intermediaries or certain foreign
partnerships, and the Non-U.S. Holder and the foreign intermediary or foreign partnership satisfies the
certification requirements of applicable U.S. Treasury regulations.

If a Non-U.S. Holder cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest (to the extent treated as paid
from U.S. sources for U.S. federal income tax purposes) will be subject to the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless the
Non-U.S. Holder provides us with a properly executed (1) IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or other applicable
form) claiming an exemption from or reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty or (2)
IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form) stating that interest paid on the Notes is not subject to withholding tax because it
is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States.

If a Non-U.S. Holder is engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on the Notes is effectively
connected with the conduct of that trade or business, then, although the Non-U.S. Holder will be exempt from the 30% U.S.
federal withholding tax (provided the requirement to deliver an IRS Form W-8ECI, or other appropriate IRS Form W-8, is
satisfied), the Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on that interest on a net income basis generally in
the same manner as if the Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. In
addition, if a Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, it may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or lesser rate under an
applicable income tax treaty) on the portion of its earnings and profits for the taxable year, subject to adjustments, that are
effectively connected with its conduct of a trade or business in the United States.


-----

_Disposition of a Note_

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding below, upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other
taxable disposition of a Note, a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or U.S. federal withholding
tax on any gain recognized unless:

(1) that gain is effectively connected with a Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States; or

(2) the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of
that disposition and certain other conditions are met.

If a Non-U.S. Holder is described in clause (1) above, it will be subject to tax on the net gain derived from the sale,
exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition (and possible branch profits tax) in generally the same
manner as discussed above with respect to effectively connected interest. If a Non-U.S. Holder is an individual described in
clause (2) above, such holder will be subject to a flat 30% tax on the gain derived from the sale, exchange, redemption,
retirement or other taxable disposition, which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses (unless an applicable income tax
treaty provides otherwise).

_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_

Generally, the amount of U.S. source interest paid to Non-U.S. Holders and the amount of tax, if any, withheld with
respect to those payments must be reported annually to the IRS and to Non-U.S. Holders. Copies of the information returns
reporting such interest and withholding also may be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which a Non-U.S.
Holder resides under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty.

In general, a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) with respect to
payments of interest on the Notes, provided the statement described above in the last bullet point under “—Payments of
Stated Interest” has been received and we do not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the holder is a U.S. person, as
defined under the Code, that is not an exempt recipient. In addition, a Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to information reporting
and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding with respect to payments of the proceeds of the sale or other
taxable disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a Note within the United States or conducted through certain
U.S.-related financial intermediaries, unless the statement described above has been received, and we do not have actual
knowledge or reason to know that a holder is a U.S. person, as defined under the Code, that is not an exempt recipient, or
the Non-U.S. Holder otherwise establishes an exemption.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a
payment to a Non-U.S. Holder generally may be claimed as a credit against such U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax
liability (if any) and any excess may result in a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder (such sections and
regulations commonly referred to as “FATCA”), when applicable, will impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on
certain types of payments, including payments of U.S. source interest made to (i) a “foreign financial institution” (as the
beneficial owner or as an intermediary for the beneficial owner) unless such institution agrees to collect and disclose to the
IRS information regarding its direct and indirect U.S. account holders or (ii) a “non-financial foreign entity” (as the
beneficial owner or as an intermediary for the beneficial owner) unless such entity certifies that it does not have any
“substantial United States owners” (as defined in the Code) or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial
United States owner (generally by providing an IRS Form W-8BEN-E). In certain circumstances, the relevant foreign
financial institution or non-financial foreign entity may qualify for an exemption from these rules, which exemption is
typically evidenced by providing appropriate documentation (such as an IRS Form W-8BEN-E). In addition, an
intergovernmental agreement between the United States and the jurisdiction of a foreign financial institution may modify
these rules.

You are urged to consult your own tax advisers regarding FATCA and the application of these requirements to
your investment in the Notes.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions stated in the purchase agreement dated the date of this Offering Memorandum,
the Initial Purchasers have severally agreed to purchase and we have agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, the entire
principal amount of the Notes.

The purchase agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to purchase the Notes are subject
to approval of legal matters by counsel and to other conditions. The Initial Purchasers must purchase all of the Notes if
they purchase any of the Notes.

The Initial Purchasers propose to resell the Notes at the offering prices set forth on the cover page of this Offering
Memorandum within the United States to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States
in reliance on Regulation S or another exemption therefrom. The price at which the Notes are offered may be changed at
any time without notice.

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any other state
securities laws (within or outside the U.S.) and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account
or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S) except in transactions exempt from, or not subject to, the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. See “Notice to Investors.”

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any EEA member state, and
the UK, will be made pursuant to an exemption to the EU Prospectus Regulation or the UK Prospectus Regulation
respectively.

The Initial Purchasers may use affiliates or other appropriately licensed entities for sales of the Notes in
jurisdictions in which they are otherwise not permitted.

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of the Notes within the United
States by a dealer that is not participating in this offering may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities
Act if that offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A.

Delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about June 8, 2022, which will be the fifth
business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement being referred to as “T+5”). Under Rule 15c6-1
under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the
parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of
this Offering Memorandum or the next seven business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at
the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should
consult their own advisors.

Application will be made for listing particulars to be approved by Euronext Dublin and for the Notes to be admitted
to the Official List of Euronext Dublin and admitted to trading on its Global Exchange Market. We cannot assure you that
the prices at which the Notes will sell in the market after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or
that an active trading market for the Notes will continue after this offering. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they
currently intend to make a market in the Notes. However, they are not obligated to do so, and they may discontinue any
market-making activities with respect to the Notes at any time without notice. In addition, market-making activity will be
subject to the limits imposed by the Exchange Act, and may be limited. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that you will
be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favorable. If an active
trading market for the Notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. If the
Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the
market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other
factors. The Initial Purchasers may conduct these transactions in the over the counter market or otherwise. Neither we nor
any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation that they will engage in these transactions. If the Initial Purchasers
commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.

In connection with this offering, the Initial Purchasers are not acting for anyone other than us and will not be
responsible to anyone other than us for providing the protections afforded to their clients or for providing advice in relation
to this offering.

Buyers of the Notes sold by the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp taxes and other charges in
accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the initial offering price set forth on the
cover of this Offering Memorandum.


-----

In connection with the offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell notes in the open market. Purchases
and sales in the open market may include short sales, purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases.

      - Short sales involve secondary market sales by the Initial Purchasers of a greater number of Notes than it is
required to purchase in the offering.

      - Covering transactions involve purchases of Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed
in order to cover short positions.

      - Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase notes so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified
maximum.

Purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases, as well as other purchases by the Initial Purchasers
for their own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes. They may
also cause the price of the Notes to be higher than the price that would otherwise exist in the open market in the absence
of these transactions. The Initial Purchasers may conduct these transactions in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.
Neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation that they will engage in these transactions. If the
Initial Purchasers commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.

The Initial Purchasers are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include
securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment,
hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates have in the past, from time
to time, performed commercial banking, investment banking and advisory services for us or our affiliates for which they
have received customary fees and reimbursement of expenses and may in the future, from time to time, engage in
transactions with and perform services for us or our affiliates in the ordinary course of their business for which they may
receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial
Purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity
securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (which may include bank loans and/or credit default
swaps) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers and may at any time hold long and short positions in
such securities and instruments. Such investment and securities activities may involve our or our affiliates’ securities and
instruments. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us routinely hedge their
credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their
affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default
swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short
positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates
may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such
securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in
such securities and instruments.

An affiliate of Citigroup Global Markets Limited will serve as trustee under the Notes, acts as security agent under
the Indenture and serves as an administration agent under ABL Facility and will receive customary fees and commissions.
One or more of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates, as applicable, are or will be hedging counterparties with
Ardagh. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders or agents under the Ardagh Group’s current
asset-backed facility, a portion of which will be repaid indirectly from the proceeds of this offering. We have agreed to
indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, or to contribute
to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make because of any of those liabilities.

registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the Notes offered
hereby are being offered and sold only to “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities
Act) in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in offshore

United States within the meaning of the Securities Act, that the Notes have not been and will not be registered

the Notes, such Notes may be offered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred only (a) in the United States to a
person whom you reasonably believe is a QIB in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A, (b) outside
the United States in a transaction complying with Regulation S and in each case in compliance with the conditions

have made any representation to it with respect to the offering or sale of any Notes, other than the information
contained in this Offering Memorandum, which Offering Memorandum has been delivered to it and upon which
it is relying in making its investment decision with respect to the Notes. It has had access to such financial and
other information concerning us and the Notes as it has deemed necessary in connection with its decision to
purchase any of the Notes.

(4) It is purchasing the Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which it is acting as a

of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within

EUWA, and it further understands that no key information document required by the UK PRIIPs Regulation for

(vi) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act,
subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property
of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and in compliance with any applicable
state securities laws, and any applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to the Issuers’ and the
Trustee’s rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer pursuant to clause (iv), (v) or (vi) to require the delivery

Irish counsel to the Issuers and Elvinger Hoss Prussen, _société anonyme, Luxembourg counsel to the Issuers and the_

Cahill Gordon & Reindel (UK) LLP, U.S. federal and New York counsel to the Initial Purchasers, McCann FitzGerald
LLP, Irish counsel to the Initial Purchasers and Loyens & Loeff Luxembourg SARL, _société à responsabilité limitée,_
Luxembourg counsel to the Initial Purchasers.

**INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM**

The consolidated financial statements of Ardagh Metal Packaging S.A. as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, incorporated in this Offering Memorandum by reference
to the Ardagh Metal Packaging S.A. Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2021, have been audited
by PricewaterhouseCoopers, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report incorporated herein.


-----

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS**

Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance, a co-issuer of the Notes is incorporated under the laws of Ireland, the Parent
Guarantor of the Notes is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg.

On the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor which is incorporated under the laws of
Luxembourg, and secured by a pledge of the shares of Lux Holdco. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, within
90 days following the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors.

The Parent Guarantor and most of the Subsidiary Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of one of many
non-U.S. jurisdictions. Furthermore, most of the directors and executive officers of the Issuers and such Guarantors live
outside the United States. Substantially all of the assets of Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance and the Guarantors (other than
the Subsidiary Guarantors in Delaware (United States)), and substantially all of the assets of their directors and executive
officers, are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for you to serve process on such persons
in the United States or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against them based on the civil liability provisions of
the securities laws of the United States. In addition, local counsel have informed us that it is questionable whether a foreign
court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced predicated solely upon U.S.
federal securities laws.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against any Issuer, the Parent Guarantor, any Subsidiary Guarantor, or
any of their respective directors or executive officers, investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where
the relevant company or individual has assets. We have been advised by counsel that there is doubt that a lawsuit based
upon United States federal or state securities laws could be brought in an original action in such foreign jurisdictions and
that a foreign judgment based upon United States federal or state securities laws would be enforced in such jurisdictions.
Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on
civil liability, whether or not based on United States federal or state securities laws, would not be automatically enforceable
in such countries. You should consult with your own advisers in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment
in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

The statute of limitations applicable to payment of interest and repayment of principal under New York law is six
years.
