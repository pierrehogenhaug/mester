These results are for illustrative purposes only and have not been subject to audit or review.

It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying accounting policies.

The Audited Financial Statements have been prepared based on a calendar year and are presented in U.S. dollars rounded to the nearest million.

308_2,Final Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Recent Developments,9.2.1,,"_Russia-Ukraine Conflict_ The recent Russia-Ukraine conflict which commenced in February 2022 has not to date resulted in any disruptions to our operations. We have no operations or employees in Russia or Ukraine, while historic sales into the region have been de minimis. In addition, we do not currently source any raw materials from Russia or Ukraine, nor do we have any current plans or intentions to do so in the future. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the conflict has exacerbated inflationary cost pressures for certain commodity inputs, notably energy, and has increased global supply chain pressures. Cost recovery initiatives are under way to mitigate elevated input costs arising from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. _Other_ On April 26, 2022, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per common share, to be paid on June 28, 2022 to shareholders of record on June 14, 2022. A second quarter dividend of $0.10 per common share has been declared and will be paid on June 28, 2022 to shareholders of record on June 14, 2022. We intend to pay a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per common share. This $0.40 dividend per common share represents a full year cash dividend of approximately $240 million. On June 1, 2022, we announced a stock buyback authorization of up to $200 million of our shares through December 31, 2023. The Ardagh Group does not intend to participate in this stock buyback program. On June 1, 2022, we announced that we intend to increase our Global Asset-Based Loan Facility from $325 million to approximately $400 million. We anticipate that our cash requirements for business growth initiative capital expenditure in 2022 will decrease from $1 billion to approximately $0.7 billion through increased use of leasing and re-phasing of certain project spending while maintaining the planned production footprint.",N/A,as_expected,2022,191

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered an alternative to profit/(loss) as indicators of operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with IFRS.

As of March 31, 2022, on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the Offering and use of proceeds therefrom, we would have had (i) total debt of $3,604 million, of which $600 million would have been debt incurred in the Offering and (ii) $267 million debt which will mature prior to the maturity of the Notes. See “Capitalization.” Our substantial debt could have important negative consequences for us, for our shareholders and for you as a holder of the Notes. For example, our substantial debt could: - require us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow from operations to service debt and fund repayments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; - increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions; - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in which we operate; - limit our ability to raise additional debt or equity capital in the future; - restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities; - make it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debt; and - place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt. In addition, debt under the ABL Facility bears, and in the future a portion of our other debt may bear, interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates. Although we may hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps, we cannot assure you that it will do so in the future. As a result, an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and debt service obligations, which would exacerbate the risks associated with its leveraged capital structure. Further, notwithstanding our current indebtedness levels and restrictive covenants, we may still be able to incur substantial additional debt or make certain restricted payments, which could exacerbate the risks described above. Negative developments in our business, results of operations and financial condition due to changes in global economic conditions or other factors could cause ratings agencies to lower the credit ratings, or ratings outlook, of its shortand long-term debt and, consequently, impair its ability to raise new financing or refinance its current borrowings and increase its costs of issuing any new debt instruments. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,191

See “Description of Other Indebtedness.” The ability of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries to comply with these ratios and to meet these tests may be affected by events beyond their control and there can be no assurances that they will continue to meet these tests. The failure of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries to comply with these obligations could lead to a default under these credit facilities unless we can obtain waivers or consents in respect of any breaches of these obligations under these credit facilities. We cannot assure you that these waivers or consents will be granted. A breach of any of these covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under these credit facilities. In the event of any default under these credit facilities, the lenders under these facilities will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us or our operating subsidiaries and could elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest, fees and other amounts due thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. In the event of a default, the relevant lenders (and, potentially, the Trustee) could also require us to apply all available cash to repay the borrowings or prevent us from making debt service payments on the Notes, any of which would be an event of default under these Notes.

These limitations arise under various provisions or principles of corporate law which include rules governing capital maintenance, under which, among others, the risks associated with a guarantee or grant of security on account of a parent company’s debt need to be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the guarantor’s or grantor’s perspective, as well as thin capitalization, unfair consideration, financial assistance, corporate purpose or similar law affecting the rights of creditors generally and fraudulent transfer principles. If these limitations were not observed, the Guarantees and the grant of Security Interests by these Subsidiary Guarantors could be subject to legal challenge. In some jurisdictions, the Guarantees will contain language limiting the amount of debt guaranteed or secured so that applicable local law restrictions ----- will not be violated. Certain of the Security Documents will contain similar limitations. Accordingly, if you were to enforce the Guarantees by a Subsidiary Guarantor in one of these jurisdictions or seek to enforce a Security Interest in Collateral granted by a Subsidiary Guarantor in one of these jurisdictions, your claims are likely to be limited. In some cases, where the amount that can be guaranteed or secured is limited by reference to the net assets and legal capital of the Subsidiary Guarantors or by reference to the outstanding debt owed by the relevant Subsidiary Guarantor to the Issuers under intercompany loans, that amount might have reached zero or close to zero at the time of any insolvency or enforcement. Furthermore, although we believe that the Guarantees by these Subsidiary Guarantors and the Security Interests granted by these Subsidiary Guarantors will be validly given in accordance with local law restrictions, there can be no assurance that a third-party creditor would not challenge these Guarantees and the Security Interests and prevail in court. The Indenture will provide that, except under very limited circumstances, only the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, will have standing to bring an enforcement action in respect of the Notes and the Guarantees and the Security Interests. Moreover, the Intercreditor Agreement restricts the rights of holders of the Notes to initiate insolvency proceedings or take other legal actions against the Subsidiary Guarantors, and by accepting any Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, within 90 days following the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors and secured, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and certain perfection requirements, by the Collateral. The Subsidiary Guarantors of the Notes are incorporated under the laws of one of England & Wales, Germany, Ireland, The Netherlands, Switzerland, the United States and Luxembourg. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and, in the case of the Guarantees and the Security Interests, limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the Security Interests. The court or an insolvency administrator may also in certain circumstances avoid the Security Interest or the Guarantee where the company is close to or in the vicinity of insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: ----- - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee or the Security Interests; - direct that holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee or any security to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to you. If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Guarantee or Security Interest is found to be a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee or the Security Interests will be limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee or Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors under the Security Documents will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. Also, there is a possibility that the Guarantees or the Security Interests may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would need to find that, at the time the Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests created, the relevant Guarantor: - issued such Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its insolvency; - issued such Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent businessman as a shareholder of such Guarantor would have contributed equity to such Guarantor; or - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Guarantee or Security Interest on the basis that the Guarantee or Security Interest were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s benefit, or some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Guarantee or the creation of the Security Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s assets were unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due. Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantee or created any Security Interest if: - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; and/or - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute. Although we believe that we are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Offering, there can be no assurance which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” as of the date the Guarantees were issued the Security Interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued or Security Interests were created, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.",N/A,as_expected,2022,191

The Second Party Opinion may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes.

Your rights to the Collateral would be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by the Collateral or a reduction of the Collateral securing the Notes.

Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, ----- including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. These interest rates could also rise significantly in the future. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense associated with the loans under any ABL Facility or other credit facilities we may enter into would correspondingly increase, thus reducing our cash flow. LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” may be subject to the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013), the European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, the UK onshored version of that European regulation and/or other regulatory guidance and/or reform. As a result of such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. The one-week and 2-month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR ceased to be determined and published on December 31, 2021. The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, has announced that, after 30 June 2023, the overnight and 12-month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR will permanently cease to be determined or published and, if the remaining 1, 3 and 6 month U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors continue to be published after that date, it will be on the basis of a changed methodology resulting in unrepresentative settings. The FCA has prohibited use after December 31, 2021 of the continuing U.S. dollar LIBOR settings by UK-supervised entities in new regulated financial contracts, instruments and/or investment fund performance measurement, although there are some exceptions. Other regulatory authorities have imposed restrictions on new use of the continuing U.S. dollar LIBOR settings. Although pounds LIBOR continues to be published in the 1, 3 and 6 month tenors, it is no longer a representative rate and there are considerable restrictions on its use. The Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates has promoted the use of SONIA compounded in arrears as the floating rate throughout the sterling wholesale markets. Future changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR or any other benchmark is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including, but not limited to, the ABL Facility, whose interest rates are linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR). Any such change, as well as the cessation of such a benchmark or its continuation on an unrepresentative basis, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in the relevant benchmark settings or a requirement to use an alternative rate setting which is not equivalent, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. If a published U.S. dollar LIBOR rate is unavailable, we may be required to substitute an alternative reference rate, such as a different benchmark interest rate or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), in lieu of U.S. dollar LIBOR. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has proposed SOFR as its recommended alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR rates in April 2018. SOFR is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight that is collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. However, because SOFR is a broad U.S. Treasury repo financing rate that represents overnight secured funding transactions, it differs fundamentally from U.S. dollar LIBOR. For example, SOFR is a secured overnight rate, while U.S. dollar LIBOR is an unsecured rate that represents interbank funding over different maturities. In addition, SOFR is a backward-looking rate, in that by the time it is published each day, all the transactions on which it is based will have matured, whereas U.S. dollar LIBOR is forward-looking. Because of these and other differences, there is no assurance that SOFR will perform in the same way as U.S. dollar LIBOR would have performed at any time, and there is no guarantee that it is a comparable substitute for U.S. dollar LIBOR. A change from U.S. dollar LIBOR to any of the proposed alternative reference rates could result in interest obligations that are more than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made on our debt if U.S. dollar LIBOR were available in its current form. Any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our financing costs. Moreover, the phase-out of U.S. dollar LIBOR may adversely affect our assessment of effectiveness or measurement of ineffectiveness for accounting purposes of any interest rate hedging agreements indexed to U.S. dollar LIBOR.",N/A,as_expected,2022,191

To the extent the liens securing the_ ABL Obligations are subordinated to or pari passu with the liens securing such DIP Financing which meets the requirement in the immediately preceding sentence, the Fixed Asset Security Agent will subordinate its liens on the ABL Collateral to the liens thereon securing such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) and will not request adequate protection or any other relief in connection therewith (except, as expressly agreed by the ABL Security Agent or to the extent permitted in the manner set forth below). If, in connection with any cash collateral use or DIP Financing, any liens on the ABL Collateral held by the ABL Creditors are subject to a surcharge or are subordinated to an administrative priority claim, a professional fee “carve-out,” or fees owed to the United States Trustee, then the liens on the ABL Collateral of the Fixed Asset Creditors shall also be subordinated to such interest or claim and shall remain subordinated to the liens on the ABL Collateral of the ABL Creditors consistent with the other terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent and the holders of ABL Obligations will agree to similar limitations with respect to their right to object to any use of cash collateral constituting Fixed Asset Collateral or to any DIP Financing to be secured at least in part by the Fixed Asset Collateral that has been consented to by the Fixed Asset Security Agent (acting on behalf of the Majority First Lien Creditors prior to the First Lien Discharge Date, and, thereafter, the Majority Second Lien Creditors) that meets comparable requirements as set forth above in this paragraph. In an insolvency or liquidation proceeding in the U.S., the provision of any DIP Financing that is secured by liens on Fixed Asset Collateral senior to or pari passu with the liens securing the First Lien Obligations or any consent to the use of cash collateral constituting Fixed Asset Collateral under section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code shall require only the consent of, prior to the First Lien Discharge Date, the Majority First Lien Creditors. _Automatic Stay_ Until the ABL Facilities Discharge Date, the Fixed Asset Security Agent, on behalf of itself and the Fixed Asset Creditors, agrees that none of them shall seek (or support any other person seeking) relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding in respect of the ABL Collateral (including the Common ABL Collateral), without the prior written consent of the ABL Security Agent. The ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent and the ABL Creditors will agree to similar limitations with respect to their right to seek relief from the automatic stay in respect of any Fixed Asset Collateral. _Sales_ Subject to certain other provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Fixed Asset Security Agent will consent and will not object or oppose, or support any party in objecting to or opposing, a motion to dispose of any ABL Collateral free and clear of any liens or other claims under Section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law), or any related motion to establish bidding procedures for such a sale or disposition, if (i) the ABL Security Agent (without requiring any further consent of the Common ABL Security Agent as it relates to the Common ABL Collateral) and the requisite ABL Creditors shall have consented to such sale or disposition of such ABL Collateral, (ii) such motion does not impair, subject to the priorities set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, the rights of the Fixed Asset Security Agent and the other Fixed Asset Creditors under Section 363(k) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision of any applicable bankruptcy law) (provided that the right of any Fixed Asset Creditor to offset its claim against the purchase price for any ABL Collateral exists only after the ABL Facilities Discharge Date), and (iii) the ----- terms of any proposed order approving such transaction provide for the liens of the Fixed Asset Security Agent and the other Fixed Asset Creditors on the ABL Collateral to attach to the proceeds of the ABL Collateral that is the subject of such disposition, subject to the lien priorities and the other terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement. The ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent and the other ABL Creditors will agree to similar limitations with respect to their right to object to a sale or other disposition of any Fixed Asset Collateral (or any portion thereof). _Adequate Protection_ None of the Fixed Asset Security Agent nor the other Fixed Asset Creditors shall contest (or support any other person contesting) in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding (1) any request by the ABL Security Agent (or by the Common ABL Security Agent at the direction of the ABL Security Agent prior to the ABL Facilities Discharge Date) or the other ABL Creditors for adequate protection with respect to the ABL Collateral, provided (A) until last Discharge Date to occur in respect of any of the Fixed Asset Obligations (the “Fixed Asset Discharge Date”) such request for adequate protection shall not seek the creation of any lien over additional assets or property of any Debtor or Security Provider other than with respect to assets or property that constitute ABL Collateral and (B) if such additional assets or property shall also constitute Fixed Asset Collateral, (i) a lien shall have been created in favor of the Fixed Asset Security Agent in respect of such Collateral and (ii) the lien thereon in favor of the ABL Creditors shall be subordinated to the extent set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, or (2) any objection by the ABL Security Agent (or by the Common ABL Security Agent at the direction of the ABL Security Agent prior to the ABL Facilities Discharge Date) or other ABL Creditor to any motion, relief, action or proceeding based on the ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent or other ABL Creditors claiming a lack of adequate protection; provided that if the ABL Security Agent or Common ABL Security Agent is granted adequate protection in the form of a lien on additional or replacement collateral, the Fixed Asset Security Agent and the other Fixed Asset Creditors may seek or request adequate protection in the form of lien on such additional or replacement collateral; it being understood and agreed that (1) if such additional or replacement collateral shall also constitute Fixed Asset Collateral, the lien on such additional or replacement collateral in favor of the ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent and the other ABL Creditors shall be subordinate to all liens on such additional or replacement collateral in favor of the Fixed Asset Security Agent and (2) if such additional or replacement collateral shall also constitute ABL Collateral, the lien on such additional or replacement collateral in favor of the ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent and the other ABL Creditors shall be senior to all liens on such additional or replacement collateral in favor of the Fixed Asset Security Agent. The ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent and the other ABL Creditors will agree to similar limitations with respect to their right to contest any request of the Fixed Asset Security Agent or the other Fixed Asset Creditors for adequate protection or any objection of the Fixed Asset Security Agent or the other Fixed Asset Creditors to any motion, relief, action or proceeding for lack of adequate protection. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement or in connection with the exercise of remedies with respect to (i) the ABL Collateral, nothing in the Intercreditor Agreement shall limit the rights of the Fixed Asset Security Agent or the other Fixed Asset Creditors from seeking adequate protection with respect to their rights in the Fixed Asset Collateral in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding (including adequate protection in the form of a cash payment, periodic cash payments or otherwise, other than from proceeds of the ABL Collateral) or (ii) the Fixed Asset Collateral, nothing in the Intercreditor Agreement shall limit the rights of the ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent or the other ABL Creditors from seeking adequate protection with respect to their rights in the ABL Collateral in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding (including adequate protection in the form of a cash payment, periodic cash payments or otherwise, other than from proceeds of the Fixed Asset Collateral). _Post-petition Interest_ No Fixed Asset Security Agent nor any other Fixed Asset Creditor shall oppose or seek to challenge any claim by the ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent or any other ABL Creditor for allowance in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding of ABL Obligations consisting of interest, fees, expenses and other charges that, pursuant to the ABL Documents, continue to accrue after the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, whether or not such interest, fees, expenses and other charges are allowed or allowable under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or any other applicable bankruptcy law) or in any such insolvency or liquidation proceeding, to the extent of the value of the lien securing any ABL Creditor’s claim, without regard to the existence of the lien of the Fixed Asset Security Agent on behalf of the Fixed Asset Creditors on the Collateral. The ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent and the other ABL Creditors will agree to similar limitations with respect to their right to oppose or seek to challenge any comparable claim by the Fixed Asset Security Agent or any other Fixed Asset Creditor for post-petition interest, fees, expenses and other charges to the extent of the value of the lien securing any such Fixed Asset Creditor’s claim. _Certain Waivers_ The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Fixed Asset Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the other Fixed Asset Creditors, (i) waives any claim and objection it may have against any ABL Creditor arising out of the election of any ABL Creditor of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision of any ----- other applicable bankruptcy law) or out of any grant of a security interest in connection with the ABL Collateral in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding (provided that any such grant of a security interest comports with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, including the provisions governing grant of security interests described under the headings “—Financing Matters” and “—Adequate Protection” above); (ii) agrees that it will not assert or enforce any claim under Section 506(c) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law) senior to or on parity with the liens on the ABL Collateral securing the ABL Obligations; and (iii) agrees that it will not assert or enforce any claim against any ABL Creditor under the “equities of the case” exception of Section 552(b) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law). The ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent and the ABL Creditors will agree to waive similar claims and objections with respect to the actions of any of the Fixed Asset Security Agent and any other Fixed Asset Creditors with respect to the Fixed Asset Collateral. _Separate Grants of Security and Separate Classification_ The Fixed Asset Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the other Fixed Asset Creditors, and the ABL Security Agent and the Common ABL Security Agent, each for itself and on behalf of the other ABL Creditors, acknowledge and agree that the grants of liens pursuant to the ABL Security Documents, the Fixed Asset Security Documents in respect of the First Lien Obligations and any future Fixed Asset Security Documents in respect of the Super Senior Obligations or the Second Lien Obligations constitute separate and distinct grants of liens, and because of, among other things, their differing rights in the Collateral, the Super Senior Obligations, the First Lien Obligations, the Second Lien Obligations and the ABL Obligations are fundamentally different and must be separately classified in any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan proposed, confirmed, or adopted in an insolvency or liquidation proceeding. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Fixed Asset Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the other Fixed Asset Creditors, and the ABL Security Agent and the Common ABL Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the other ABL Creditors, each agrees that the Super Senior Creditors, the First Lien Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the ABL Creditors will vote as separate classes in connection with any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding and that no Security Agent nor any Creditor will seek to vote with a Creditor of another class as a single class in connection with any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. To further effectuate the intent of the parties as provided in this paragraph, if it is held that the claims of the Super Senior Creditors, the First Lien Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the ABL Creditors in respect of the Collateral constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate classes of secured claims subject to the relative lien priorities set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement), then the Fixed Asset Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the Fixed Asset Creditors and the ABL Security Agent and the Common ABL Security Agent, each for itself and on behalf of the ABL Creditors, will acknowledge and agree that, subject to certain other provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, all distributions from the ABL Collateral shall be made as if there were separate classes of senior and junior secured claims against the Debtors and/or Security Provider in respect of the ABL Collateral (with the effect being that, to the extent that the aggregate value of the ABL Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all claims held by the Fixed Asset Creditors), the ABL Creditors shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest and other claims, all amounts owing in respect of post-petition interest, fees, expenses and other charges, including any additional interest payable pursuant to the ABL Documents, arising from or related to a default, whether or not a claim therefor is allowed as a claim in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding) before any distribution from the ABL Collateral is made in respect of the claims held by the Fixed Asset Creditors, with each Fixed Asset Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the applicable Fixed Asset Creditors, acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to the ABL Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the ABL Creditors, amounts otherwise received or receivable by them from the ABL Collateral to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the claim or recovery of the Fixed Asset Creditors). The ABL Security Agent and the Common ABL Security Agent, each for itself and on behalf of the ABL Creditors and the Fixed Asset Security Agent (for itself and on behalf of each class of Fixed Asset Creditors), acknowledge and agree to similar turnover provisions with respect to the Fixed Asset Collateral. The Fixed Asset Security Agent and the other Fixed Asset Creditors, on the one hand, and the ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent and the ABL Creditors, on the other hand, shall retain the right to vote and otherwise act in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding (including the right to vote to accept or reject any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan) to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2022,191

On or promptly following the ABL Facilities Discharge Date, to the extent permitted by applicable law (unless any other person has made a demand therefor and is lawfully entitled thereto or unless a court of competent jurisdiction otherwise directs), if the Fixed Asset Discharge Date has not occurred, the ABL Security Agent shall, without recourse or warranty, take commercially reasonable steps to deliver to the Fixed Asset Security Agent any Collateral and proceeds of Collateral held by it as a result of the exercise of remedies in the same form as received, with any necessary endorsements or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct to be applied by the Fixed Asset Security Agent to the Fixed Asset Obligations; it being understood that any security interest in deposit accounts, securities accounts or commodities accounts in favor of the Fixed Asset Obligations may no longer exist upon the ABL Facilities Discharge Date, and the ABL Security Agent shall not be required to take any action in connection with such accounts or any assets deposited therein or credited thereto. Similar terms shall apply, following the Fixed Asset Discharge Date, to the Fixed Asset Security Agent. _Permitted Actions_ Notwithstanding the provisions described in this section “—Enforcement of security” or any restrictions on Creditors undertaking any Enforcement Action, each Security Agent and any Creditor of any class may (i) file a claim or statement of interest with respect to the Obligations of such class, provided that an insolvency or liquidation proceeding has been commenced by or against any Debtor or Security Provider, (ii) take any action in order to create, perfect, preserve or protect its lien on any of the Collateral; _provided that such action shall not be inconsistent with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and shall not be adverse to the priority status of the liens of the Security Agents on the Collateral, or the rights of the Security Agents or the other Creditors to exercise remedies in respect thereof as permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement, (iii) file any necessary or appropriate responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding or other pleading made by any person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of its claims or liens, in each case in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, (iv) file any pleadings, objections, motions or agreements that assert rights or interests available to unsecured creditors of any Debtor or Security Provider arising under either any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or applicable non-bankruptcy law, in each case not inconsistent with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, (v) vote on any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan, file any proof of claim, make other filings and make any arguments and motions that are, in each case, in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (subject to the proviso in clause (ii) above), or (vi) exercise any of its other rights or remedies with respect to any of the Collateral to the extent permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement. _Entry Upon Premises by ABL Security Agent and ABL Creditors_ If the Fixed Asset Security Agent, or any agent, representative or affiliate of the Fixed Asset Security Agent, any Fixed Asset Creditor or any receiver, shall obtain possession or physical control of any real properties subject to a Fixed Asset Security Document that constitute Fixed Asset Collateral or any material portion of the tangible Fixed Asset Collateral located on any premises other than real properties subject to a Fixed Asset Security Document, the Fixed Asset Security Agent shall promptly notify the ABL Security Agent in writing of that fact (such notice, a “Notice of Occupancy”) and the ABL Security Agent shall, within thirty (30) days thereafter, notify the Fixed Asset Security Agent in writing if and when the ABL Security Agent and the Common ABL Security Agent desire to exercise its access rights as outlined in this section (such rights, the “ABL Access Rights”). Upon delivery of such notice by the ABL Security Agent to the Fixed Asset Security Agent, the parties shall confer in good faith to coordinate with respect to the ABL Security Agent’s and the Common ABL Security Agent’s exercise of such access rights; provided, that it is understood and agreed that the Fixed ----- Asset Security Agent shall obtain possession or physical control of such real properties in the manner provided in the applicable Fixed Asset Security Documents and in the manner provided in the Intercreditor Agreement.

During any such Access Period, the ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent (with respect to the Common ABL Collateral and at the direction of the ABL Security Agent), and their respective employees, agents, advisors, representatives and designees (and persons employed on their respective behalves), may continue to operate, service, maintain, process and sell the ABL Collateral, including by public auction, private sale or a “store closing”, going out of business sale or similar sale, whether in bulk, in lots or to customers in the ordinary course of business or otherwise and which sale may include augmented inventory of the same type sold in any Debtor’s (or Security Provider’s) business. The ABL Security Agent (and the Common ABL Security Agent, with respect to the Common ABL Collateral) shall take proper care of any Fixed Asset Collateral that is used by the ABL Security Agent or the Common ABL Security Agent, as applicable, during the Access Period and, subject to the protections and immunities of the ABL Security Agent and the Common ABL Security Agent contained in the Intercreditor Agreement, shall procure the repair and replacement of any damage (ordinary wear-and-tear excepted) to the Fixed Asset Collateral directly caused by the ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent or their respective employees, agents, advisors, representatives or designees and the ABL Security Agent (and the Common ABL Security Agent, with respect to the Common ABL Collateral) shall comply in all material respects with all applicable laws (and the ABL Security Agent and the Common ABL Security Agent may rely on advice received by legal counsel in connection therewith) in connection with its use or occupancy of the Fixed Asset Collateral. The ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent and the other ABL Creditors shall (only and solely to the extent that there are sufficient available proceeds of ABL Collateral, that ABL Creditors (other than the ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent and the ABL Agent) have or are entitled to receive, for the purposes of paying such indemnity) indemnify and hold harmless the Fixed Asset Security Agent and the other Fixed Asset Creditors for any injury or damage to persons or property (ordinary wear-and-tear excepted) caused by the acts or omissions of the ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent or their respective employees, agents, advisors, representatives or designees; provided that the ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent and the other ABL Creditors shall not be liable for any diminution in the value of the Fixed Asset Collateral caused by the absence or removal of the ABL Collateral therefrom. In no event shall the ABL Creditors, the ABL Security Agent or the Common ABL Security Agent have any liability to the Fixed Asset Creditors and/or to the Fixed Asset Security Agent as a result of (i) any environmental condition, claim, damage, loss or liability existing prior to or after the date of exercise by the ABL Security Agent or the Common ABL Security Agent of its ABL Access Rights with respect to that Fixed Asset Collateral, except as may be directly caused by the ABL Security Agent or the Common ABL Security Agent, or (ii) any condition, claim, damage, loss or liability on or with respect to the Fixed Asset Collateral (x) existing prior to the date of the exercise by the ABL Security Agent or the Common ABL Security Agent of its ABL Access Rights with respect to such Fixed Asset Collateral or (y) not directly caused by or resulting from the actions taken or not taken by the ABL Security Agent or the Common ABL Security Agent. The ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent and the Fixed Asset Security Agent shall cooperate and use reasonable efforts to ensure that their activities during the Access Period as described above do not interfere materially with the activities of the other as described above, including the right of the Fixed Asset Security Agent to show the Fixed Asset Collateral to prospective purchasers and to ready the Fixed Asset Collateral for sale. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no circumstance whatsoever in connection with the ABL Security Agent’s or the Common ABL Security Agent’s activities as described above shall the ABL Security Agent or the Common ABL Security Agent (i) be required to expend its own funds in indemnifying any party or repairing or replacing (or the procurement thereof) of any damage to any Fixed Asset Collateral, or (ii) be liable to any party for any repair, condition, claim, damage, loss or injury in respect of the Fixed Asset Collateral; provided the ABL Security Agent or the Common ABL Security Agent, as applicable, is acting without gross negligence or willful misconduct. In the event that the ABL Security Agent or the Common ABL Security Agent elects to exercise its access rights as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement, the Fixed Asset Security Agent agrees, for itself and on behalf of the other Fixed Asset Creditors, that in the event that the Fixed Asset Security Agent exercises its rights to sell or otherwise dispose of any real property, whether before or after the delivery of a Notice of Occupancy to the ABL Security Agent and the Common ABL Security Agent, the Fixed Asset Security Agent shall (i) provide access rights to the ABL Security Agent and the Common ABL Security Agent for the duration of the Access Period in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement ----- and (ii) if such a sale or other disposition occurs prior to the ABL Security Agent delivering its notice of its desire to exercise its and the Common ABL Security Agent’s ABL Access Rights during the time period provided therefor, or if applicable, the expiration of the applicable Access Period, shall ensure that the purchaser or other transferee of such real property provides the ABL Security Agent and the Common ABL Security Agent the opportunity to exercise its access rights, and upon delivery of such a notice to such purchaser or transferee, continued access rights to the ABL Collateral for the duration of the applicable Access Period, in the manner and to the extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement. _No Interference; Reinstatement; Tracing of Proceeds_ Each Fixed Asset Creditor agrees that, prior to the ABL Discharge Date, whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding has been commenced by or against any Debtor or Security Provider: (i) it will not (and it hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right to), directly or indirectly (including by joining or directing any other Person to), contest, or support any other person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the extent, attachment, perfection, priority, validity or enforceability of a lien held, or allowability of any claims asserted, by or on behalf of any of the ABL Creditors in the Collateral (or the extent, attachment, perfection, priority, validity, enforceability or allowability of any ABL Security Document or any ABL Obligations secured thereby or purported to be secured thereby), or the provisions or enforceability of the Intercreditor Agreement; provided that nothing in the Intercreditor Agreement will be construed to prevent or impair the rights of the Fixed Asset Security Agent to enforce the Intercreditor Agreement; (ii) it will not (and it hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right to), directly or indirectly (including by joining or directing any other Person to), contest, protest or object to, or otherwise interfere with, any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent or any other ABL Creditor or any other exercise by the ABL Security Agent or any other ABL Creditor of any rights and remedies relating to the ABL Collateral, whether under the ABL Documents or otherwise; (iii) it will not (and it hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right to), directly or indirectly (including by joining or directing any other Person to), object to the forbearance by the ABL Security Agent, the Common ABL Security Agent or any other ABL Creditor from bringing or pursuing any collateral enforcement action or any other proceeding, action, or the exercise of any right or remedy relating to the ABL Collateral; and (iv) it will not assert, and it waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right to demand, request, plead or otherwise assert or otherwise claim the benefit of, any marshalling, appraisal, valuation or other similar right that may otherwise be available under applicable law with respect to the ABL Collateral or any other similar rights a junior secured creditor or unsecured creditor may have under applicable law. Each ABL Creditor will agree to similar limitations to those described in clauses (i) through (iv) above with respect to their rights in the Fixed Asset Collateral and their ability to bring a suit against the Fixed Asset Security Agent or the other Fixed Asset Creditors. To the extent any payment with respect to any ABL Obligation is rescinded for any reason whatsoever or declared to be or avoided as a fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, or a preference in any respect, set aside or required to be turned over or otherwise paid to a debtor in possession or trustee in bankruptcy (a “Recovery”), any Fixed Asset Creditor, receiver or similar person, whether in connection with any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or otherwise, then the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall, for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement and the rights and obligations of the ABL Creditors and the Fixed Asset Creditors, be deemed to be reinstated and outstanding as if such payment had not occurred. If the Intercreditor Agreement is terminated prior to such Recovery, the Intercreditor Agreement shall be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior termination shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the parties thereto from such date of reinstatement. To the extent that any interest, fees, expenses or other charges (including, without limitation, post-petition interest and all amounts accruing on or after the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding relating to any Debtor or Security Provider, or that would have accrued or become due under the terms of the ABL Documents but for the effect of the insolvency or liquidation proceeding) to be paid pursuant to the ABL Documents are disallowed by order of any court, such interest, fees, expenses and charges shall, as between the ABL Creditors and the Fixed Asset Creditors, be deemed to continue to accrue and be added to the amount to be calculated as the “ABL Obligations.” The ABL Creditors will be subject to similar limitations with respect to the Fixed Asset Collateral and any proceeds or payments in respect of any Fixed Asset Collateral. The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that prior to an issuance of a notice of enforcement of remedies by a Security Agent or any other Secured Creditor, (i) all funds deposited in an account subject to a control agreement or ----- dominion account that constitutes ABL Collateral and then applied to the ABL Obligations shall be treated as ABL Collateral and, unless the ABL Security Agent has actual knowledge to the contrary, any claim that payments made to the ABL Security Agent through the deposit accounts and securities accounts that are subject to such control agreements or dominion accounts, respectively are proceeds of or otherwise constitute Fixed Asset Collateral are waived by the Fixed Asset Creditors, (ii) all funds deposited in any account not forming a part of the ABL Collateral and then applied to the Fixed Asset Obligations shall be treated as Fixed Asset Collateral and, unless the Fixed Asset Security Agent has actual knowledge to the contrary, any claim that payments made to the Fixed Asset Security Agent through such account are proceeds of or otherwise constitute ABL Collateral are waived by the ABL Creditors, and (iii) any proceeds of Collateral, whether or not deposited in an account subject to a control agreement or a securities account control agreement, shall not (as between the Security Agents, the ABL Creditors and the Fixed Asset Creditors) be treated as proceeds of Collateral for purposes of determining the relative priorities in the Collateral. The ABL Creditors agree that the Fixed Asset Creditors and the Fixed Asset Security Agent have no duty to the ABL Creditors in respect of the maintenance or preservation of the Fixed Asset Collateral, the ABL Collateral, the Fixed Asset Obligations, or otherwise. The Fixed Asset Creditors agree that the ABL Creditors and the ABL Security Agent have no duty to the Fixed Asset Creditors in respect of the maintenance or preservation of the ABL Collateral, Fixed Asset Collateral, the ABL Obligations, or otherwise. _Consent to License to Use Property_ Without limiting any rights any of the ABL Creditors may otherwise have under applicable law or by agreement and whether or not the Fixed Asset Security Agent has commenced and is continuing to undertake any Enforcement Action or is otherwise exercising any rights, powers or remedies with respect to the Collateral, the Fixed Asset Security Agent, the Debtors and the Security Providers will grant under the Intercreditor Agreement (to the full extent of their respective rights and interests) to the ABL Security Agent and the Common ABL Security Agent an irrevocable, non-exclusive worldwide right to have access to, and a worldwide, royalty-free (and also free of any other obligation of payment), non-exclusive license (or, as applicable, sublicense, to the extent permitted without requiring payment to any third party or obtaining any consent or waiver of any third party) and right to use the Fixed Asset Collateral, including, without limitation, intellectual property, intellectual property rights, general intangibles and real property and equipment, processors, computers and other machinery related to the storage or processing of records, documents or files, (i) to access the ABL Collateral and (ii) to assemble, inspect, copy or download information stored on, take actions to perfect its lien on, process raw materials or work-in-process into finished inventory, take possession of, move, package, prepare and advertise for sale or disposition, sell (by public auction, private sale or a “going out of business” or similar sale, whether in bulk, in lots or to customers in the ordinary course of business or otherwise and which sale may include augmented inventory of the same type sold in Debtors’ (or Security Provider’s) business), store, collect, take reasonable actions to protect, secure and otherwise enforce the rights of ABL Security Agent in and to the ABL Collateral (and of the Common ABL Security Agent in and to the Common ABL Collateral), or otherwise deal with the ABL Collateral, in each case without the involvement of or interference by any of the Fixed Asset Creditors, including in connection with any Enforcement Action commenced by, or the exercising of any rights, powers or remedies with respect to the ABL Collateral by, the ABL Security Agent or the Common ABL Security Agent, or in connection with the sale or other disposition of, or collection on, such ABL Collateral during the continuance of an event of default under the ABL Credit Agreement that is consented to in writing by the ABL Security Agent or the Common ABL Security Agent (at the direction of the ABL Security Agent), as applicable. _Release of Liens_ If in connection with a Disposition (as defined below), any other sale, transfer or other disposition of ABL Collateral (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Common ABL Collateral) pursuant to the terms of the ABL Documents, the designation of “Excluded Accounts Receivable” (or equivalent term) pursuant to the terms of the ABL Documents, the exercise of the ABL Security Agent’s or the Common ABL Security Agent’s remedies in respect of any ABL Collateral (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Common ABL Collateral), or in connection with the sale or other disposition of, or collection on, such ABL Collateral (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Common ABL Collateral) during the continuance of an event of default under the ABL Credit Agreement that is consented to in writing by the ABL Security Agent (or by the Common ABL Security Agent at the direction of the ABL Security Agent), the ABL Security Agent or the Common ABL Security Agent (at the direction of the ABL Security Agent), each for itself or on behalf of any ABL Creditor releases any of its liens on any part of the ABL Collateral (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Common ABL Collateral), then the liens, if any, of the Fixed Asset Security Agent, for itself or for the benefit of the other Fixed Asset Creditors, on such ABL Collateral (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Common ABL Collateral) subject to such transaction, will be automatically, unconditionally and simultaneously released. The Fixed Asset Security Agent shall execute and deliver to the ABL Security Agent such termination statements, releases and other documents as the ABL Security Agent may reasonably request to effectively confirm such release.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Guarantors will be Ardagh Metal Packaging S.A. and certain subsidiaries that guarantee the Existing AMP Notes and the ABL Facility in each of England & Wales, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, the United States, The Netherlands and, with respect to Lux Holdco and Ardagh Metal Packaging Holdings Sarl only, Luxembourg (the “Subsidiary Guarantors”). The Subsidiary Guarantors accounted for 76% of the aggregate total assets and 68% of the Adjusted EBITDA of the Group as of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2022. Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the issuance of Disqualified Stock of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Certain Definitions—Indebtedness.” In addition, as described under _“Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain Subsidiaries of the Company that guarantee the ABL Facility, the Existing AMP Notes or the Senior Secured Notes in the future or any other Credit Facility or Public Debt, in each case, of the Issuers or a Guarantor, shall also enter into a supplemental senior secured notes indenture as a Guarantor and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders. See “Security—The Collateral.” Each Senior Secured Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed Security Principles, to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee. See “Risk _Factors—Risks Relating to Our Debt, the Notes and the Guarantees—Corporate benefit, capital maintenance laws and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Security Interests may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes and the Security Interests” and “—The insolvency laws of Luxembourg and other local insolvency laws may not be as favorable to you as U.S. bankruptcy laws or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar.”_ A portion of the operations of the Company will be conducted through Subsidiaries that are not expected to become Guarantors.

The Senior Secured Notes and each Senior Secured Notes Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of the Company’s Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any). As of March 31, 2022, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions (including the Offering and the use of the proceeds therefrom as described in “Use of Proceeds”), the Company would have had, on a consolidated basis, total outstanding debt of $3,604 million (equivalent) in aggregate principal amount.",N/A,as_expected,2022,191

No book-entry interest of less than $200,000 in principal amount may be redeemed in part, and book-entry interests may be redeemed only in multiples of $1,000. If the Senior Secured Notes are not held through DTC or DTC prescribes no method of selection, the Senior Secured Notes will be selected, on a pro rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Senior Secured Note in an unauthorized denomination remains outstanding after such redemption. The Trustee, any Paying Agent and the Registrar shall not be liable for selections made under this paragraph. Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least 10 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Senior Secured Notes to be redeemed at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Senior Secured Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. Notice of any redemption of the Senior Secured Notes may, at the Issuers’ discretion, be given prior to the completion of a transaction (including, but not limited to, an Equity Offering, an Incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of Control or other transaction) and any redemption may, at the Issuers’ discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a related transaction.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any payment to a holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or any person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Senior Secured Notes directly. In addition, the Payor will pay, and reimburse each applicable Holder for, any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest, penalties or other similar liabilities with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest, penalties or similar liabilities with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from (i) the execution, issuance, delivery or registration of the Senior Secured Notes, any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, the ----- Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto, or (ii) the receipt of any payments under or with respect to, or enforcement of, the Senior Secured Notes or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee (limited, solely in the case of any such taxes attributable to the receipt of payments, to any such taxes that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3), (5), or (6) above). The Payor, if it is the applicable withholding agent, will (i) make any required withholding or deduction, (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law, and (iii) upon written request, provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee (with a copy to the Principal Paying Agent). Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the Principal Paying Agent. If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Senior Secured Note or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Principal Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Principal Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee and the Principal Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction (other than the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia) in which any successor to a Payor is organized, resident, or doing business for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Senior Secured Notes (or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.",N/A,as_expected,2022,191
308_2,Final Offerings 2022.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.23,Change of Control,21.23.1,,"The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless (i) a third party makes a change of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Issuers have previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Senior Secured Notes as described under “Optional Redemption,” the Issuers will make an offer to purchase all of the Senior Secured Notes (equal to $200,000 in principal amount or in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof; _provided that Senior Secured Notes of $200,000 or less in principal amount may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase. Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Issuers will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below. ----- To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuers may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuers repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may (i) constitute a default under the ABL Facility that permits the ABL Facility lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder and (ii) trigger a requirement for the Issuers to make an offer to repurchase the Existing AMP Notes at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof. Future Indebtedness of the Issuers or the Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuers to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuers. The Issuers’ ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by their then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Senior Secured Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes and us. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuers could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “Certain _Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture_ can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Senior Secured Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under “Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding. If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Exchange so require, the Issuers will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer.",N/A,as_expected,2022,191

If at any time the Senior Secured Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status, then the Suspended Covenants will thereafter be reinstated as if such covenants had never been suspended (the “Reversion Date”) and will be applicable pursuant to the terms of the Indenture (including in connection with performing any calculation or assessment to determine compliance with the terms of the Indenture), unless and until the Senior Secured Notes subsequently attain Investment Grade Status (in which event the Suspended Covenants shall no longer be in effect for such time that the Senior Secured Notes maintain an Investment Grade Status); provided, however, that no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist under the Senior Secured Notes Documents with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on, and none of the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries shall bear any liability with respect to such Suspended Covenants for, any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising prior to the Reversion Date, regardless of whether such actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in effect during such period. The period of time between the date of suspension of the covenants and the Reversion Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period.” On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period (other than any Indebtedness incurred under the ABL Facility) will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(a) of the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” On and after the Reversion Date, all Liens created during the Suspension Period will be considered Permitted Liens pursuant to clause (11) of such definition. Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under “—Limitation _on Restricted Payments” will be made as though the covenants described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”_ had been in effect since the Issue Date and prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (6) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.” Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Restrictions on _Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have_ existed on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation _on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.” On and after each Reversion Date, the Company and the_ Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such contract and such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period. In addition, any future obligation to grant further Senior Secured Notes Guarantees shall be released. All such further obligation to grant Senior Secured Notes Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date. There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status. ----- The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Senior Secured Notes, shall not be deemed to have any knowledge of the ratings of the Senior Secured Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders of the Senior Secured Notes achieve Investment Grade Status or upon the occurrence of the Reversion Date. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions under this covenant have been satisfied, although such notification shall not be a condition for suspension of the applicable covenants to be effective.",N/A,as_expected,2022,191

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2022,191

Upon such a declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to an Issuer occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Senior Secured Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a responsible officer of the Trustee is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Issuers, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuers. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year.

The Notes sold to persons outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S will be represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Note”, and together with Rule 144A Global Note, the “Global Notes.”) The Rule 144A Global Note and the Regulation S Global Note will be deposited with a custodian for, and registered in the name of, Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC. Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Rule 144A Book-entry Interests”) and in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-entry Interests” and, together with the Rule 144A Book-entry Interests, the “Book-entry Interests”) will be limited to persons who have accounts with DTC, or persons who hold interests through such participants. DTC will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-entry Interests will not be held in definitive certificated form. Book-entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records maintained in the book-entry form by DTC and its participants. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-entry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes for any purpose. So long as the Notes are held in global form, DTC (or its respective nominees), will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of DTC and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of DTC and the participants through which they own Book-entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture.

The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by DTC in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that, under the existing practices of DTC, if fewer than all of Notes are to be redeemed at any time, DTC will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a pro rata pass-through distribution of principal basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate in accordance with the rules and procedures of DTC; _provided, however, that no Book-entry Interest of less than $200,000 may be redeemed in part._",N/A,as_expected,2022,191

We will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described under “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.” If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent described under “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes,” we will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-entry Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction.

The Global Notes for Rule 144A Book-entry Interests will have a legend to the effect set forth under “Notice to Investors.” Book-entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed under “Notice to Investors.” Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the offering of the Notes and the closing of the offering (the “Distribution Compliance Period”), Regulation S Book-entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Rule 144A Global Note only if such transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A and the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person whom the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Notice to Investors” and in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other jurisdictions. After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, Regulation S Book-entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A Book-entry Interest without compliance with these certification requirements.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-entry Interest for a Rule 144A Book-entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Notes and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Notes. Any Book-entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-entry Interest. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,191

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer such Note by surrendering it to the registrar or transfer agent. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable; provided that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than $200,000 will be issued.

Also, we are not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for redemption. In the event of the transfer of any Definitive Registered Note, the Trustee may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents as described in the applicable Indenture. We may require a holder to pay any taxes and fees required by law and permitted by the applicable Indenture and the Notes. If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Note has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Note is mutilated and is surrendered to the registrar or at the office of the transfer agent, we will issue and the Trustee, upon receipt of an authentication order, will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and our requirements are met.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged only after the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes.

It does this through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of securities participants, eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations such as the Initial Purchasers. Others, such as banks, brokers, dealers, trust companies and clearing corporations, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant also have access to the DTC system and are known as indirect participants. Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC system or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the DTC system will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Note only through DTC participants.

You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Notes” under the heading “Certain Definitions” below. For purposes of this “Description of the Notes,” references to the “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us” refer only to Ardagh Metal Packaging S.A. and not to any of its Subsidiaries, except for the purpose of financial data determined on a consolidated or combined basis, as the case may be. The term “Issuers” refers only to AMP USA and AMP Ireland collectively, and not to any of their respective Subsidiaries. The Issuers will issue the Senior Secured Notes under an indenture to be dated on or about the Issue Date (the “Indenture”), between, inter alios, the Issuers, the Company as guarantor, Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”) and as security agent (in such capacity, the “Security Agent”) and Citibank, N.A., London Branch as paying agent, in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Indenture will not be qualified under, incorporate by reference or include, or be subject to, any of the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act, including Section 316(b) thereof. Consequently, the Holders will not be entitled to the protections provided under the Trust Indenture Act to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including among other things, those requiring the Trustee to resign in the event of certain conflicts of interest and to inform the Holders of certain relationships between it and us. Following the Issue Date, the Company intends to amend its articles of association to permit the issuance of the Preferred Shares as described in “Summary— The Offering of Preferred Shares.” The proceeds from the offering of the Senior Secured Notes sold on the Issue Date will be released to the Issuers and used with the proceeds from the subscription for the Preferred Shares as described in “Use of Proceeds.” Upon the initial issuance of the Senior Secured Notes on the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be (i) direct obligations of the Issuers and (ii) guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Company. On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be secured by a pledge over 100% of the shares of Ardagh Metal Packaging Group Sarl, a Luxembourg holding company (“Lux Holdco”), granted by the Company (the “Lux Holdco Share Pledge”). Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries which guarantee the Existing AMP Notes (as defined below) and the ABL Facility located in England & Wales, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, the United States and The Netherlands (together with Lux Holdco and Ardagh Metal Packaging Holdings Sarl, the “Subsidiary Guarantors”) will enter into one or more supplemental indentures to become a party to the Indenture and guarantee the Senior Secured Notes on a senior secured basis within 90 days from the Issue Date. The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount. We may, subject to applicable law and the terms of the Indenture, issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Senior Secured Notes (the “Additional Senior Secured _Notes”); provided that if any of the Additional Senior Secured Notes are not fungible for U.S. federal income tax purposes_ with the Senior Secured Notes, such Additional Senior Secured Notes will be issued with a separate ISIN code and CUSIP from the Senior Secured Notes originally issued. We will only be permitted to issue Additional Senior Secured Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture, including the covenants restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the Incurrence of Liens.

Unless the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Notes,” references to the “Senior Secured Notes” include the Senior Secured Notes and any Additional Senior Secured Notes that are actually issued under the Indenture. The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below) and in the case of certain conflicts between the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Senior Secured ----- Notes and the Indenture and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. Since this description of the terms of the Senior Secured Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Senior Secured Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Company and your rights. Copies of such documents will be made available from us upon request on and after the Issue Date. The registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.

However, for so long as the Notes are listed on a recognized stock exchange such as the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin and the Notes carry a right to interest, the Notes will constitute “quoted Eurobonds”. Under Section 64 of the TCA 1997 no withholding for or on account of Irish income tax will be required to be made on interest arising on quoted Eurobonds provided they meet the following criteria: (a) they are held in a recognized clearing system; (b) the interest is paid by or through a person who is not in Ireland; or (c) the beneficial owner of the Notes is not resident in Ireland and has made all necessary declarations in the prescribed form. As the Notes will constitute “quoted Eurobonds” and meet the above criteria, there will be no requirement to withhold tax. There is also an exemption for interest paid by a qualifying company (within the meaning of Section 110 of the TCA 1997) to a person who is resident in another EU Member State or a country with which Ireland has a tax treaty, except in a case where the interest is paid to a company in relation to a business which that company carries on in Ireland through a branch or agency. Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance has elected to be treated as such a qualifying company. No Irish withholding tax is payable in respect of a repayment of any principal amount of the Notes. No Irish withholding tax is payable in respect of interest that does not have an Irish source and does not arise to an Irish resident. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,191

In the case of persons that are individuals, interest will be liable to income tax at the marginal rate (up to 40%). Such income will also be liable to the Universal Social Charge at rates of up to 11% depending on the individual’s circumstances. Irish Pay Related Social Insurance contributions may also be payable. In the case of corporate entities, the rate of corporation tax applying to the interest income is 25% (unless the income constitutes trading income). Interest paid by an Irish resident company to persons resident outside Ireland and who are resident in a “relevant territory” is exempt from Irish income tax where the Notes constitute “quoted Eurobonds”. A “relevant territory” for this purpose is a Member State of the European Union (other than Ireland), or a territory with which Ireland has entered into a double tax treaty. Where interest is paid to or income, gains or discounts are realized by a person tax resident outside a relevant territory, such Irish source income may be chargeable to Irish income tax. However, a company (wherever resident) under the control of persons who are resident in a relevant territory and not under the control of Irish residents should not be liable to Irish tax on interest arising on quoted Eurobonds. A company (wherever resident) whose principal class of shares are quoted on a recognized stock exchange is also not taxable on such interest on quoted Eurobonds. Ireland operates a self-assessment system in respect of income taxes, corporation taxes, social insurance and the universal social charge. Any person with Irish source income which is chargeable to Irish income tax comes within the scope of that system and may have to file a return.

The Irish and U.S. governments signed an intergovernmental agreement (“Irish IGA”) on December 12, 2012. Under the Irish IGA, information about relevant U.S. investors will be provided on an annual basis by each Irish FI (unless the FI is exempted from the FATCA requirements) directly to the Irish Revenue Commissioners, who will then provide such information to the U.S. tax authorities. _CRS_ ----- The Common Reporting Standard (“CRS”) requires participating jurisdictions to exchange certain information held by financial institutions regarding their non-resident customers. Over 100 jurisdictions, including Ireland, have committed to exchanging information under the CRS and the first data exchanges took place in September 2017. CRS does not impose any additional requirements to withhold tax on payments to investors. _Reporting Obligations under FATCA and the CRS_ A common feature of both FATCA and the CRS is that entities that are classified as “Financial Institutions” are required to identify their investors and in certain circumstances report information to their local tax authorities (for onward reporting to overseas tax authorities, in the case of CRS, and for onward reporting to the U.S. tax authorities, in the case of FATCA). The Irish Revenue Commissioners have issued regulations and guidance notes making compliance with the Irish provisions implementing CRS and FATCA mandatory. As a result, Irish entities that are classified as “Financial Institutions” in accordance with FATCA and CRS have obligations in respect of the Irish law implementing CRS and FATCA. On the basis that Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance does not fall within the definition of “Financial Institution” for FATCA and CRS purposes, it should not have any reporting obligations under FATCA or CRS. However, there may be still FATCA or CRS reporting applicable to the Notes by persons other than Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance but this will be dependent upon various factors such as the entities from which the Noteholders will directly receive interest on the Notes, the rules applicable in the jurisdictions of these entities, where the ultimate beneficial owners of the Notes are resident and their FATCA and CRS status.",N/A,as_expected,2022,191
308_2,Final Offerings 2022.md,557,TAXATION,557.1,Ireland Taxation,557.1.12,Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive,"The Council of the European Union adopted two Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives (the “EU ATADs”) which require all EU member states to introduce a number of anti-tax avoidance measures. The EU ATADs contain various measures that could potentially result in certain payments made by Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance not being fully tax deductible. This could increase Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance’s liability to tax and reduce the amounts available for payments on the Notes. There are two measures of particular relevance. The “Interest Limitation Rule” which restricts the tax-deductible interest of an entity. Ireland implemented the Interest Limitation Rule in its Finance Act 2021 to apply to companies with respect to accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2022. The Interest Limitation Rule provides that where an entity has exceeding borrowing costs (defined below) of more than EUR 3,000,000 in respect of an accounting period of 12 months, its exceeding borrowing costs in excess of 30% of its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation will not be deductible in the year in which they are incurred but would remain available for carry forward, subject to certain conditions. For these purposes, exceeding borrowing costs mean the amount by which an entity’s borrowing costs exceed interest revenues and other economically equivalent taxable revenues. Where Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance uses its share of the proceeds of the Notes to lend to group companies, which is expected to be the case, it is expected that it should not have exceeding borrowing costs and, thus it is expected that the Interest Limitation Rule should have limited impact, if any. The “Anti- Hybrid Rules” which are designed to neutralise arrangements where amounts are deductible from the income of one entity but are not taxable for another, or the same amounts are deductible for two entities. These rules could potentially apply to Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance where (a) the interest that Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance pays under the Notes, and claims deductions from the relevant taxable income for, is not brought into account as taxable income by the relevant Noteholder either because of the characterisation of the Notes, or because of the nature of the Noteholder itself and (b) the mismatch arises between Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance and an associated enterprise or under a structured arrangement. For the purposes of the Anti-Hybrid Rules, a structured arrangement is one involving a mismatch outcome where the mismatch outcome is priced into the terms of the arrangement or the arrangement was designed to give rise to a mismatch outcome. The Directors do not expect that the Company should enter into a structured arrangement. Entities are associated for these purposes where there is a direct or indirect participation in terms of voting rights or capital ownership of 25 per cent. or more or an entitlement to receive 25 per cent. or more (50 per cent. in certain circumstances) of the profits of that entity as well as entities that are part of the same consolidated group for financial accounting purposes or enterprises that have a significant influence in the management of the taxpayer. In this context, “significant influence” means an ability to participate, on the board of directors of Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance, in the financial and operating policy decisions of Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance, including where that power does not extend to control or joint control of Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance. Even if Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance has or had at any time, an associated enterprise that is or was since 1 ----- January 2020 beneficially entitled to payments on the Notes, the measures should not impact those payments on the Notes unless there is also a hybrid mismatch with respect to those payments.",N/A,as_expected,2022,191

A number of jurisdictions (including Luxembourg) have entered into intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement FATCA (‘‘IGAs’’), which modify the way in which FATCA applies in their jurisdiction.

United States Federal Income Taxation,557.3.2,U.S. Holders,"_Payments of Stated Interest_ Stated interest paid on a Note generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary interest income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For most U.S. Holders, interest income with respect to the Notes will constitute “passive category” income, which may be relevant in calculating the U.S. Holder’s foreign tax credit limitation. The rules governing foreign tax credits are complex and, therefore, U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the availability of foreign tax credits in their particular circumstances. _Original issue discount_ The Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their “issue price” by an amount equal to or more than a statutorily defined _de minimis amount, the Notes will be issued by OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and a U.S. Holder will be_ required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) as it accrues (on a constant yield to maturity basis) for U.S. federal income tax purposes in advance of the receipt of the cash payments to which such OID is attributable, regardless of such U.S. Holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under these rules, a U.S. Holder generally will have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual periods. The rules governing OID instruments are complex, and, therefore, U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of such rules to the Notes. The remainder of this discussion of “United States Federal Income Taxation” assumes that the Notes will not be issued with OID. _Disposition of a Note_ Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized on such disposition (except to the extent any amount realized is attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which is taxable as described under “—Payments of Stated Interest”) and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will be the cost at which the U.S. Holder acquires such Note. The amount realized on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note will include the amount of any cash and the fair market value of any property received for such Note. Any gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder on the disposition of a Note will be U.S. source capital gain or loss and will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the Note has been held for more than one year at the time of the disposition of the Note. For certain non-corporate holders (including individuals), any such long-term capital gain is subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. _Foreign Financial Asset Reporting_ Certain U.S. Holders may be required to report information relating to an interest in the Notes, subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for Notes held in accounts maintained by certain U.S. financial institutions). U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the effect, if any, of this legislation on their ownership and disposition of the Notes including the significant penalties for non-compliance with this requirement. ----- _Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_ In general, information reporting requirements may apply to certain payments to a U.S. Holder of interest on the Notes and to the proceeds of a sale, exchange or other taxable disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a Note. Backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) may be required on such amounts if the U.S. Holder fails to (i) furnish the U.S. Holder’s taxpayer identification number, (ii) certify that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding as a result of a prior failure to report interest or dividends or (iii) otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Certain exempt U.S. Holders (including, among others, corporations) are not subject to the backup withholding and information reporting requirements. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a U.S. Holder generally may be claimed as a credit against such U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability (if any) and any excess may result in a refund, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner.",N/A,as_expected,2022,191

United States Federal Income Taxation,557.3.3,Non-U.S. Holders,"_Payments of Stated Interest_ As discussed above under “—Source of Interest Payments,” an applicable withholding agent likely will treat all payments on the Notes as U.S. source. Subject to the discussion of backup withholding and FATCA below, to the extent that payments of interest on the Notes are treated as paid from U.S. sources for U.S. federal income tax purposes, neither U.S. federal income tax nor the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax on U.S. source interest will apply to any payment of interest on a Note to a Non-U.S. Holder provided that: - interest paid on the Note is not effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States; - the Non-U.S. Holder does not actually or constructively own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of Ardagh Metal Beverage USA Inc. stock that are entitled to vote within the meaning of section 871(h)(3) of the Code; - the Non-U.S. Holder is not a bank whose receipt of interest on a Note is described in section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code; - the Non-U.S. Holder is not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to Ardagh Metal Beverage USA Inc. (actually or constructively) through stock ownership; and - (1) the Non-U.S. Holder provides its name and address, and certifies, under penalties of perjury, that it is not a U.S. person (which certification may be made on an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, or other applicable form) or (2) the Non-U.S. Holder holds the Note through certain foreign intermediaries or certain foreign partnerships, and the Non-U.S. Holder and the foreign intermediary or foreign partnership satisfies the certification requirements of applicable U.S. Treasury regulations. If a Non-U.S. Holder cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest (to the extent treated as paid from U.S. sources for U.S. federal income tax purposes) will be subject to the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless the Non-U.S. Holder provides us with a properly executed (1) IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or other applicable form) claiming an exemption from or reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty or (2) IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form) stating that interest paid on the Notes is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States. If a Non-U.S. Holder is engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on the Notes is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business, then, although the Non-U.S. Holder will be exempt from the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax (provided the requirement to deliver an IRS Form W-8ECI, or other appropriate IRS Form W-8, is satisfied), the Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on that interest on a net income basis generally in the same manner as if the Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. In addition, if a Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, it may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or lesser rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on the portion of its earnings and profits for the taxable year, subject to adjustments, that are effectively connected with its conduct of a trade or business in the United States. ----- _Disposition of a Note_ Subject to the discussion of backup withholding below, upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or U.S. federal withholding tax on any gain recognized unless: (1) that gain is effectively connected with a Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States; or (2) the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of that disposition and certain other conditions are met. If a Non-U.S. Holder is described in clause (1) above, it will be subject to tax on the net gain derived from the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition (and possible branch profits tax) in generally the same manner as discussed above with respect to effectively connected interest. If a Non-U.S. Holder is an individual described in clause (2) above, such holder will be subject to a flat 30% tax on the gain derived from the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition, which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses (unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise). _Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_ Generally, the amount of U.S. source interest paid to Non-U.S. Holders and the amount of tax, if any, withheld with respect to those payments must be reported annually to the IRS and to Non-U.S. Holders. Copies of the information returns reporting such interest and withholding also may be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which a Non-U.S. Holder resides under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty. In general, a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) with respect to payments of interest on the Notes, provided the statement described above in the last bullet point under “—Payments of Stated Interest” has been received and we do not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the holder is a U.S. person, as defined under the Code, that is not an exempt recipient. In addition, a Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to information reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding with respect to payments of the proceeds of the sale or other taxable disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a Note within the United States or conducted through certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries, unless the statement described above has been received, and we do not have actual knowledge or reason to know that a holder is a U.S. person, as defined under the Code, that is not an exempt recipient, or the Non-U.S. Holder otherwise establishes an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a Non-U.S. Holder generally may be claimed as a credit against such U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability (if any) and any excess may result in a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.",N/A,as_expected,2022,191

In certain circumstances, the relevant foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity may qualify for an exemption from these rules, which exemption is typically evidenced by providing appropriate documentation (such as an IRS Form W-8BEN-E). In addition, an intergovernmental agreement between the United States and the jurisdiction of a foreign financial institution may modify these rules.

United States Federal Income Taxation,557.3.5,,"The following summary describes certain U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant with respect to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Notes. This summary applies only to holders who purchase Notes for cash in this offering at their “issue price” (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money to investors (not including bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers)) indicated on the cover of this Offering Memorandum and who will hold the Notes as capital assets. It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase the Notes. In particular, this summary does not address tax considerations applicable to holders that may be subject to special tax rules including, without limitation, the following: (i) banks or other financial institutions; (ii) insurance companies; (iii) dealers or traders in securities or currencies; (iv) tax exempt entities; (v) persons who will hold Notes as part of a “hedging” or “conversion” transaction or as a position in a “straddle” or as part of a “synthetic security” or other integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes; (vi) U.S. Holders (as defined below) who have a “functional currency” other than the U.S. dollar; (vii) regulated investment companies; (viii) partnerships and other pass-through entities (and investors therein); (ix) persons who have ceased to be U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents of the United States; (x) U.S. Holders who hold Notes through a non-U.S. broker or other non-U.S. intermediary; and (xi) persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an “applicable financial statement” (as defined in Section 451 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)). Further, this summary does not address alternative minimum tax consequences or any U.S. federal tax consequences other than U.S. federal income tax consequences (such as, U.S. federal estate and gift tax consequences, or the Medicare tax on certain investment income) or any U.S. state and local or foreign tax consequences of acquiring, owning or disposing of Notes. This summary is based on the Code and U.S. Treasury regulations and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. All of the foregoing are subject to change, which change could apply retroactively and could affect the tax consequences described below. For purposes of this summary, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes: (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation, created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) the trust was in existence on August 20, 1996 and has properly elected to continue to be treated as a U.S. person. For purposes of this summary, a “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership (or other entity or arrangement that is treated as a partnership) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or other pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in or owner of the partnership or other pass-through entity generally will depend upon the status of the partner or owner and the activities of the entity. A person that is a partner in a partnership or other pass-through entity that is considering investing in Notes should consult its own tax adviser. Each prospective investor should consult its own tax adviser with respect to the U.S. federal (including income, Medicare, estate and gift), state, local and foreign tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of Notes. Holders should also review the discussions under “Ireland Taxation” and “Luxembourg Taxation” for the Irish tax consequences and Luxembourg tax consequences, respectively, to a holder of the ownership of Notes. In certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of stated principal on the Notes or retire the Notes before their stated maturity dates. See, e.g., “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.” Notwithstanding these possibilities, we do not believe that any of the Notes are contingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and, consequently, we do not intend to treat the Notes as contingent payment debt instruments. If, notwithstanding our view, any of the Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, a U.S. Holder generally would be required to accrue ordinary income at a rate in excess of the stated interest rate on such Notes and to treat as ordinary income (rather than capital gain) any gain recognized on a sale or other taxable disposition of such Notes. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,191

On the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor which is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg, and secured by a pledge of the shares of Lux Holdco. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, within 90 days following the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors. The Parent Guarantor and most of the Subsidiary Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of one of many non-U.S. jurisdictions. Furthermore, most of the directors and executive officers of the Issuers and such Guarantors live outside the United States. Substantially all of the assets of Ardagh Metal Packaging Finance and the Guarantors (other than the Subsidiary Guarantors in Delaware (United States)), and substantially all of the assets of their directors and executive officers, are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for you to serve process on such persons in the United States or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against them based on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States. In addition, local counsel have informed us that it is questionable whether a foreign court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against any Issuer, the Parent Guarantor, any Subsidiary Guarantor, or any of their respective directors or executive officers, investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company or individual has assets. We have been advised by counsel that there is doubt that a lawsuit based upon United States federal or state securities laws could be brought in an original action in such foreign jurisdictions and that a foreign judgment based upon United States federal or state securities laws would be enforced in such jurisdictions. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not based on United States federal or state securities laws, would not be automatically enforceable in such countries. You should consult with your own advisers in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States. The statute of limitations applicable to payment of interest and repayment of principal under New York law is six years. -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,191
