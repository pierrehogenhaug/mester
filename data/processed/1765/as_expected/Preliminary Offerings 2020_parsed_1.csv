1765_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,271,NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES,271.1,,271.1.1,,"We have included certain financial measures in this Offering Circular that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) in order to provide investors with an alternative method for assessing our operating results in a manner that enables investors to more thoroughly evaluate our current performance as compared to past performance. We also believe these non-GAAP measures provide investors with a better baseline for modeling our future earnings expectations. Our management uses these non-GAAP measures for the same purpose. We believe that our investors should have access to the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We have provided a definition below for these non-GAAP financial measures, together with an explanation of why management uses these measures and why management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors. For a reconciliation between these non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, please see “Summary—Summary Historical Financial and Other Data.” We define Adjusted EBITDA as GAAP net income before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income taxes, gain (loss) on sale of assets, (income) loss from closed locations, and other non-cash or special items including asset impairments, facility closure costs, acquisition costs, severance, conversion, transaction and integration costs, and stock compensation expense. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure in the evaluation of our business and believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of our performance because it eliminates the effects of period to period changes in taxes, costs associated with capital investments, interest expense, stock compensation expense and other non-cash and non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. When evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, investors should consider, among other factors, (i) increasing or decreasing trends in Adjusted EBITDA, (ii) whether Adjusted EBITDA has remained at positive levels historically, and (iii) how Adjusted EBITDA compares to our debt outstanding. We provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income. Because Adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income and may vary among companies, Adjusted EBITDA presented by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA does not give effect to the cash we must use to service our debt or pay income taxes and thus does not reflect the funds generated from or used in operations or actually available for capital investments. We define free cash flow as GAAP net cash from operating activities net of purchases of property, plant and equipment. Our management uses free cash flow as a supplemental measure in the evaluation of our business as we believe it provides a meaningful evaluation of our liquidity. Free cash flow is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net cash flow from operations or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.",N/A,as_expected,2020,134

Many of our competitors are small, privately owned businesses with limited product offerings, access to capital and information technology infrastructure.

Net sales for the three-month period ended December 31, 2019 are expected to be between $1,725 million and $1,780 million, down 2 to 5 percent compared to the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2019 is expected to be between $100 million and $110 million, down between 12 and 20 percent compared to the prior year period. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA, an explanation of the reasons our management uses this measure and a discussion of certain of its limitations, see “—Summary Historical Financial and Other Data.” Additionally, the Company estimates that, as of December 31, 2019, long-term debt and lease obligations totaled approximately $1,286 million, net of approximately $14 million of cash and cash equivalents, as compared to long-term debt and lease obligations of approximately $1,334 million, net of approximately $43 million of cash and cash equivalents, as of September 30, 2019.

Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure in the evaluation of our business and believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of our performance because it eliminates the effects of period to period changes in taxes, costs associated with capital investments, interest expense, stock compensation expense and other non-cash and non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income below. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information on limitations of non-GAAP financial measures. When evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, investors should consider, among other factors, (i) increasing or decreasing trends in Adjusted EBITDA, (ii) whether Adjusted EBITDA has remained at positive levels historically, and (iii) how Adjusted EBITDA compares to our debt outstanding. We provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income. Because Adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income and may vary among companies, Adjusted EBITDA presented by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA does not give effect to the cash we must use to service our debt or pay income taxes and thus does not reflect the funds generated from or used in operations or actually available for capital investments.

1765_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to our Indebtedness and the Notes,13.1.1,Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the Notes.,"We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of September 30, 2019, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had approximately $1,420.6 million of total debt outstanding, including $500.0 million of the Notes offered hereby and $920.6 million of total secured debt outstanding (consisting of $157.1 million of borrowings under the First-Lien Facility, $47.0 million of borrowings under the ABL Facility, with $766.5 million of additional availability (subject to availability under a borrowing base and after giving effect to $82.2 million of letters of credit outstanding as of September 30, 2019) thereunder, $475.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2027 Secured Notes and $241.5 million of other finance obligations and finance lease obligations). In addition, we had $292.8 million in operating lease obligations as of September 30, 2019. Our substantial debt could have important consequences to us, including: - increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions; - requiring a substantial portion of our operating cash flow to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our liquidity and our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities; - exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates, and corresponding increased interest expense, because borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are at variable rates of interest; - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; - limiting our ability to adjust to changing marketplace conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have less debt; or - limiting our attractiveness as an investment opportunity for potential investors. In addition, some of our debt instruments, including those governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the 2027 Secured Notes, contain cross-default provisions that could result in our debt being declared immediately due and payable under a number of debt instruments, even if we default on only one debt instrument. In such event, it is unlikely that we would be able to satisfy our obligations under all of such accelerated indebtedness simultaneously. Our financial condition and operating performance, including that of our subsidiaries, are also subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. There are no assurances that we will maintain a level of liquidity sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium and interest on our indebtedness, including the Notes. 12 ----- If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations in an effort to meet our debt service and other obligations. The 2027 Secured Notes Indenture (as defined below) and the agreements governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities restrict, and the Indenture will restrict, our ability to dispose of assets and to use the proceeds from such dispositions. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or be able to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due, including payments on the Notes. In addition, any borrowings under the ABL Facility will be secured indebtedness and therefore would be effectively senior to the Notes offered hereby and the Guarantees to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness.

Borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the 2027 Secured Notes are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and any existing and future guarantors. 14 ----- If an event of default occurs under the 2027 Secured Notes Indenture or the agreements governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the holders of such senior secured indebtedness will have a prior right to our secured assets, to the exclusion of the holders of the Notes, even if we are in default with respect to the Notes. In that event, our secured assets would first be used to repay in full all indebtedness and other obligations secured by them (including all amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the 2027 Secured Notes), resulting in all or a portion of our assets being unavailable to satisfy the claims of the holders of the Notes and other unsecured indebtedness. Therefore, in the event of any distribution or payment of our assets in any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, or other bankruptcy proceeding, holders of the Notes will participate in our remaining assets ratably with each other and with all holders of our unsecured indebtedness that is deemed to be of the same class as such notes, and potentially with all of our other general creditors, based upon the respective amounts owed to each holder or creditor. In any of the foregoing events, we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the Notes. As a result, holders of such notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of secured indebtedness. As of September 30, 2019, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, (i) we would have had approximately $1,420.6 million of total debt outstanding, all of which ranks pari passu in right of payment with the Notes, and (ii) the Notes would be effectively subordinated to $920.6 million of total secured debt outstanding (consisting of $157.1 million of borrowings under the First-Lien Facility, $47.0 million of borrowings under the ABL Facility, with $766.5 million of additional availability (subject to availability under a borrowing base and after giving effect to $82.2 million of letters of credit outstanding as of September 30, 2019) thereunder, $475.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2027 Secured Notes and $241.5 million of other finance obligations and finance lease obligations) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

A court might do so if it found that when we issued the Notes, or in some states when payments became due under the Notes, we received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and: - were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence; - were left with inadequate capital to conduct our business; - believed or reasonably should have believed that we would incur debts beyond our ability to pay; or - were a defendant in an action for money damages or had a judgment for money damages docketed against us if, in either case, the judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment. The court might also void the issuance of the Notes, without regard to the above factors, if the court found that we issued the Notes with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its creditors. A court would likely find that we did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the Notes if we did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes. If a court were to void the issuance of the Notes you would no longer have any claim against us. Sufficient funds to repay the Notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining obligors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from us. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the Notes. Further, the avoidance of the Notes could result in an event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other debt, which could result in acceleration of that debt. The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, we would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of our debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of our assets; 15 ----- - if the present fair saleable value of our assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay our probable liability on our existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - we could not pay our debts as they become due. On the basis of historical financial information, recent operating history and other factors, we believe that we, after giving effect to these Notes, will not be insolvent, will not have unreasonably small capital for the business in which we are engaged and will not have incurred debts beyond our ability to pay such debts as they mature. In addition, we are not a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for money damages docketed against us, for which the judgment was unsatisfied after final judgment. We cannot assure you, however, as to what standard a court would apply in making these determinations or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard. Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the Notes to other claims against us under the principle of equitable subordination if the court determines that (a) the holder of Notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (b) the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of Notes and (c) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.",N/A,as_expected,2020,134

A guarantee could also be deemed a fraudulent transfer if it was given with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud any entity to which the guarantor was or became, on or after the date the guarantee was given, indebted. 16 ----- The measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, a guarantor would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than all its assets, at a fair valuation; - the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. We cannot predict: - what standard a court would apply in order to determine whether a guarantor was insolvent as of the date it issued a guarantee, or whether, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would determine that the guarantor was insolvent on that date; or - whether a court would determine that the payments under a guarantee would constitute fraudulent transfers or fraudulent conveyances on other grounds. The Indenture will contain a “savings clause” intended to limit each Guarantor’s liability under its Guarantee to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the Guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer under applicable law. There can be no assurance that this provision will be upheld as intended. In 2009, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of Florida in Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of TOUSA, Inc. v. Citicorp N. Am., Inc. found this kind of provision in that case to be ineffective, and held the guarantees to be fraudulent transfers and voided them in their entirety. If a Guarantee is deemed to be a fraudulent transfer, it could be voided altogether, or it could be subordinated to all other debts of the Guarantor. In such case, any payment by the Guarantor pursuant to its Guarantee could be required to be returned to the Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the creditors of the Guarantor. If a Guarantee is voided or held unenforceable for any other reason, holders of the Notes would cease to have a claim against the Guarantor based on the Guarantee and would be creditors only of the Issuer and any Guarantor whose Guarantee was not similarly voided or otherwise held unenforceable.",N/A,as_expected,2020,134

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, including a Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Company, or any third party making a such tender offer in lieu of the Company, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Company or such third party will have the right upon not less than 15 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 15 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price equal to the price offered to each other Holder (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption. Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below. Notice of any redemption of the Notes may, at the Company’s discretion, be given prior to the completion of a corporate transaction (including an Equity Offering, an incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of Control or other corporate transaction) and any redemption notice may, at the Company’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a related transaction. If such redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Company’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption was mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed. In addition, the Company may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Company’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person. If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to the redemption date will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Company. Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.",N/A,as_expected,2020,134

1765_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.9,Selection and Notice,21.9.1,,"If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select the Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed, as certified to the Trustee by the Company, and in compliance with the requirements of DTC, or if the Notes are not so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Notes are not held through DTC or DTC prescribes no method of selection, the Trustee will select on a pro rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Note 31 ----- in an unauthorized denomination remains outstanding after such redemption; provided, however, that no Note of $2,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least 15 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a global note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.",N/A,as_expected,2020,134
1765_1,Preliminary Offerings 2020.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.10,Change of Control,21.10.1,,"The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless the Company has previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Company will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase, subject to the right of Holders of the Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company will deliver or cause to be delivered notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the procedures of DTC or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Company may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders of the Notes to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the Credit Agreement and the ABL that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder and would also likely require the Company to offer to repurchase the Existing Notes. Future Indebtedness of the Company or its subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to require the Company to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. 32 ----- Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Notes and us. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control after the Issue Date, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. A sale, lease or other disposition by the Company of any part of its assets shall not be deemed to constitute the sale, lease or other disposition of substantially all of its assets for purposes of the Indenture if the fair market value of the assets retained by the Company exceeds 100% of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Notes and any other outstanding Indebtedness of the Company that ranks equally with, or senior to, the Notes with respect to such assets. This paragraph is not intended to limit the Company’s sales, leases or other dispositions of less than substantially all of its assets. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.",N/A,as_expected,2020,134

The period of time between the date of suspension of the covenants and the Reversion Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period.” On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of “— Limitation on Indebtedness.” On and after the Reversion Date, all Liens created during the Suspension Period will be considered Permitted Liens. Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be made as though the covenants described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect since the Issue Date and prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (6) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.” Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of “— Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have existed on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.” In addition, any future obligation to grant further Guarantees shall be released. All such further obligation to grant Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date. No Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have 34 ----- occurred on the Reversion Date as a result of any actions taken by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period. On and after each Reversion Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such contract and such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status. The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes, shall not be deemed to have any knowledge of the ratings of the Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Notes achieve Investment Grade Status or of the occurrence of a Reversion Date.",N/A,as_expected,2020,134

(2) additionally, all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness may later be reclassified as having been Incurred pursuant to any type of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant so long as such Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred pursuant to such provision and any related Liens are permitted to be Incurred at the time of reclassification (it being understood that any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to one of the clauses of the second paragraph of this covenant shall 38 ----- cease to be deemed incurred or outstanding for purposes of such clause but shall be deemed incurred for the purposes of the first paragraph of this covenant from and after the first date on which the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries could have incurred such Indebtedness under the first paragraph of this covenant without reliance on such clause); (3) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the Credit Agreement and the ABL shall be deemed to have been Incurred on the Issue Date under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the description of this covenant; (4) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, such Indebtedness shall not include the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including, without limitation, tender premiums), defeasance costs, fees and other costs and expenses (including, without limitation, original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing; (5) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included; (6) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as incurred pursuant to any clause of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included; (7) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof; (8) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; (9) in the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a revolving credit facility, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as applicable, for borrowings and reborrowings thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the Company’s option as elected on the date the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, enters into or increases such commitments, either (a) be determined on the date of such revolving credit facility or such increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof has been borrowed as of such date), and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as applicable, at the time of any borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as applicable) or (b) be determined on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any such facility or increased commitment; 39 ----- (10) in the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (x) incurs Indebtedness to finance an acquisition or (y) assumes Indebtedness of Persons that are acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or merged into the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the date of determination of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall, at the option of the Company, be the date that a definitive agreement for such acquisition is entered into and the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such acquisition and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) consistent with the definition of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and, for the avoidance of doubt, (A) if any such ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such ratio (including due to fluctuations in the EBITDA of the Company or the target company) at or prior to the consummation of the relevant acquisition, such ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether such acquisition and any related transactions are permitted hereunder and (B) such ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such acquisition or related transactions; provided, further, that if the Company elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, (i) any such transaction shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreement is entered into and to be outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any ratios under the Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the earlier of the date of consummation of such acquisition or the date such agreement is terminated or expires without consummation of such acquisition and (ii) to the extent any covenant baskets were utilized in satisfying any covenants, such baskets shall be deemed utilized until the earlier of the date of consummation of such acquisition or the date such agreement is terminated or expires without consummation of such acquisition, but any calculation of Consolidated EBITDA for purposes of other incurrences of Indebtedness or Liens or making of Restricted Payments (not related to such acquisition) shall not reflect such acquisition until it has been consummated; (11) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing; and (12) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of GAAP. Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Company shall be in default of this covenant). 40 ----- For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided, that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (a) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (b) the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. The Indenture will provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that is subordinated or junior in right of payment to any Indebtedness of the Company or such Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such Indebtedness is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee to the extent and in the same manner as such Indebtedness is subordinated to other Indebtedness of the Company or such Guarantor, as the case may be. The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or is secured by different collateral or because it is guaranteed by different obligors.",N/A,as_expected,2020,134

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset Disposition, together with all other Asset Dispositions since the Issue Date (on a cumulative basis) (including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise), received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; and (3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied: (a) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is required by the terms of any Indebtedness), (i) to prepay, repay or purchase any Indebtedness of a Non 49 ----- Guarantor (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary) or any Secured Indebtedness, including Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, the Existing Notes or ABL (or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) within 450 days from the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; _provided, however, that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of_ Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (i), the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and, other than any such Indebtedness under the ABL (or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof), will cause the related commitment (if any) to be reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased; or (ii) to prepay, repay or purchase Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided further that, to the extent the Company redeems, repays or repurchases such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (ii), the Company shall equally and ratably reduce Obligations under the Notes as provided under “— Optional Redemption,” through open-market purchases (to the extent such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof) or by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on the amount of Notes that would otherwise be prepaid; and (b) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary equal to the amount of Net Available Cash received by the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary) within 450 days from the later of (after giving effect to any Acceptable Commitment or Second Commitment (each as defined below), the “Application Period”) (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that a binding agreement shall be treated as a permitted application of Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment with the good faith expectation that an amount equal to Net Available Cash will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an “Acceptable Commitment”) and, in the event of any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such amount is applied in connection therewith, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within 180 days of such cancellation or termination; provided further that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such amount is applied, then such Net Available Cash shall constitute Excess Proceeds; _provided that, pending the final application of the amount of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clause_ (a) or clause (b) above, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture; provided further that if at any time during the Application Period the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to 4.00 to 1.00, the Net Available Cash shall be deemed to have been applied in accordance with this covenant and the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. The amount of any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the Indenture. On the 451st day after the later of an Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the Indenture exceeds the greater of $125.0 million and 25% of LTM EBITDA, the Company will within 10 Business Days be required to make an offer (“Asset Disposition _Offer”) to all Holders of Notes issued under the Indenture and, to the extent the Company elects, to all holders of_ other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and, with respect to the Notes, in minimum denominations of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Company will deliver notice of such Asset Disposition Offer 50 ----- electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Asset Disposition and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 15 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice. The Company may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to all Net Available Cash prior to the expiration of the relevant 450 days (or such longer period provided above) or with respect to any unapplied Excess Proceeds. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Company shall allocate the Excess Proceeds among the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness provided that no Notes or other such Pari Passu Indebtedness will be selected and purchased in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Additionally, the Company may, at its option, make an Asset Disposition Offer using proceeds from any Asset Disposition at any time after the consummation of such Asset Disposition. Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Disposition Offer, any remaining Net Available Cash shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Company may use such Net Available Cash for any purpose not prohibited by the Indenture. To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in U.S. dollars that is actually received by the Company upon converting such portion into U.S. dollars. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Foreign Subsidiary (a “Foreign Disposition”) is (x) prohibited or delayed by applicable local law, (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents or any agreement or (z) subject to other onerous organizational or administrative impediments from being repatriated to the United States, the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary so long, but only so long, as the applicable local law documents or agreements will not permit repatriation to the United States (the Company hereby agreeing to use reasonable efforts (as determined in the Company’s reasonable business judgment) to otherwise cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary to within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required, promptly take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law, applicable organizational impediments or other impediment to permit such repatriation), and if within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required such repatriation of any of such affected Net Available Cash is permitted under the applicable local law, applicable organizational impediment or other impediment, such repatriation will be promptly effected and such repatriated Net Available Cash will be promptly (and in any event not later than five (5) Business Days after such repatriation could be made) applied (net of additional Taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) (whether or not such repatriation actually occurs) in compliance with this covenant and (ii) to the extent that the Company has determined in good faith that repatriation of any of or all the Net Available Cash of any Foreign Disposition would have an adverse Tax consequence (which for the avoidance of doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any prepayment whereby doing so the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary, or any of their respective affiliates and/or equity owners would incur a tax liability, including a tax dividend, deemed dividend pursuant to Code Section 956 or a withholding tax, the Net Available Cash so affected may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary. The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default. For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash: 51 ----- (1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or a Guarantor) and the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition; (2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents, or by their terms are required to be satisfied for cash and Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received), in each case, within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition; (3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; (4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; and (5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of $135.0 million and 4.0% of Total Assets (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value). To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws, rules and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The provisions of the Indenture relative to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes. The Credit Agreement, the Existing Notes and ABL may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Company becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Company from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Company is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Company could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Company’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2020,134

The Indenture will permit the Company to satisfy its obligations in this covenant with respect to financial information relating to the Company by furnishing financial information relating to a Parent Entity; provided that the same is accompanied by consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such Parent Entity (and other direct or indirect Parent Entities included in such information, if any), on the one hand, and the information relating to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, the consolidating information referred to in the proviso in the preceding sentence need not be audited. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, if the Company or any Parent Entity of the Company has furnished the Holders of Notes or filed with the SEC the reports described in the preceding paragraphs with respect to the Company or any Parent Entity, the Company shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions of this covenant. The Trustee shall have no duty to review or analyze any reports furnished or made available to it and the Trustee’s receipt of such reports shall not constitute actual or constructive knowledge of the information contained therein or determinable therefrom, including the Company’s compliance with any of its covenants (as to which the Trustee is entitled to conclusively rely on an Officer’s Certificate).",N/A,as_expected,2020,134

If since the beginning of such period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged or amalgamated with or into the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, operational change, business expansion, or disposed or discontinued operation that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or disposed operation had occurred at the beginning of the reference period. For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction (including the Transactions), the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of the Company (and may include, for the avoidance of doubt, cost savings, operating expenses reductions and synergies resulting from such transactions which is being given pro forma effect).

However, a Default under clause (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Company of the Default and, with respect to clause (6), the Company does not cure such Default within the time specified in clause (6) of this paragraph after receipt of such notice; provided that a notice of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more than two years prior to such notice of Default. Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder delivered to the Company and the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of Default (a “Default _Direction”) shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise_ ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Company with such other information as the Company may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Noteholder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Company has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default or acceleration (or notice thereof) that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Default or Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. The Trustee shall have no liability to the Company, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction. 63 ----- If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Company and the Trustee may, and the Trustee (subject to certain conditions) at the request of such holders shall, declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “—Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled, waived and rescinded if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Company occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal or interest which may only be waived with the consent of each affected Holder) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. Any time period in the Indenture to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction to the extent such actual or alleged Default or Event of Default is the subject of litigation. The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60day period. 64 ----- Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and is known to the Trustee, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability (it being understood that the Trustee has no duty to determine if any directed action is prejudicial to any Holder). Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses that may be caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Trustee will not be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to the Trustee at its office specified in the Indenture and such notice references the Notes and the Indenture and states that it is a “Notice of Default”. The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of Default unless the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in fact such a Default is received by the Trustee at its office specified in the Indenture, and such notice references the Notes and this Indenture and states that it is a “Notice of Default.”",N/A,as_expected,2020,134

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture. Because this is a summary, it may not contain all the information that is important to you. You should read the Indenture in its entirety. A copy of the proposed form of the Indenture may be requested as described under “Where You Can Find Additional Information And Incorporation By Reference.” You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under “— Certain Definitions.” The capitalized terms defined in “—Certain Definitions” below are used in this “Description of the Notes” as so defined.

This summary is based on the provisions of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial authority, published administrative positions of the IRS and other applicable authorities, all as in effect as of the date of this document, and all of which are subject to change. Changes in such authorities or new interpretations thereof may have retroactive effect and could significantly affect the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below. We have not sought, nor do we intend to seek, a ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with our statements and conclusions or that a court would sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation. This summary applies only to holders (1) that purchase Notes in this offering for cash at their “issue price” (generally, the initial price at which a substantial amount of the Notes are sold for cash to persons other than bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and (2) that will hold their Notes as “capital assets” within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This summary is general in nature and does not purport to deal with all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation or other tax considerations that might be relevant to particular holders in light of their personal investment circumstances or status, nor does it address U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to holders that may be subject to special tax rules, such as banks and other financial institutions, individual retirement and other tax-deferred accounts, tax-exempt entities, S corporations, partnerships or other pass-through entities or arrangements for U.S. federal income tax purposes or investors in such entities or arrangements, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, broker-dealers, dealers or traders in currencies or securities that use a mark-to-market method of tax accounting, former citizens or residents of the United States, governments and their controlled entities, persons subject to the personal holding company or accumulated earnings rules, taxpayers subject to the anti-inversion rules, persons required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income as a result of Section 451(b) of the Code, U.S. Holders that hold Notes through non-U.S. brokers or other non-U.S. intermediaries, and taxpayers subject to the alternative minimum tax. This summary also does not discuss Notes held as part of a hedge, straddle, synthetic security, conversion or other integrated transaction, or situations in which the “functional currency” of a U.S. Holder is not the United States dollar. Moreover, this summary also does not discuss any consequences resulting from the Medicare tax on net investment income or the effect of any U.S. federal taxes other than income taxes (such as estate or gift taxes), or any state, local or non-United States taxes. In the case of Notes held by an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax treatment of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes to a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the tax status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership.

HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO THE ACQUISITION, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE NOTES IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS, AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER OTHER U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-UNITED STATES TAXING JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATY.",3298.1,Effect of Certain Contingencies on the Notes,3298.1.1,,"In certain circumstances (e.g., in the case of a change in control) we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of stated interest or principal on the Notes or in advance of their scheduled due dates. Our obligation to pay such excess or accelerated amounts may implicate the provisions of the Treasury regulations relating to “contingent payment debt obligations,” in which case the timing and amount of income inclusions and the character of income recognized may be different from the consequences described herein. Under these Treasury regulations, however, one or more contingencies will not cause a debt instrument to be treated as a contingent payment debt instrument if, as of the issue date, such contingencies in the aggregate are considered “remote” or “incidental.” Although the issue is not free from doubt, we believe and intend to take the position that the foregoing contingencies should, in the aggregate, be treated as remote and/or incidental. Our position is binding on a holder, unless the holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS, and we can give holders no assurance that our position would be sustained if challenged by the IRS. A successful challenge of this position by the IRS could adversely affect the timing and amount of a holder’s income with respect to the Notes, and holders subject to U.S. federal income tax might be required to accrue income on the Notes based upon a “comparable yield” (as defined in the Treasury regulations) in excess of stated interest and to treat any gain from the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note as ordinary income, rather than capital gain. This summary assumes that the Notes will not be considered contingent payment debt instruments.

Upon the disposition of a Note by sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition, a U.S. Holder will generally recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount realized on the taxable disposition (other than any amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxed as ordinary interest income to the extent not previously included in income) and (ii) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note at the time of the taxable disposition. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note generally will be the price paid therefor. Any such gain or loss will generally constitute capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss to the extent the U.S. Holder’s holding period for such Note is more than one year. Any such capital gain or loss will be shortterm capital gain or loss to the extent the U.S. Holder’s holding period for such Note is one year or less. Non 108 ----- corporate U.S. Holders, including individuals, are generally subject to a reduced U.S. federal income tax rate on net long-term capital gains.

Additionally, the applicable withholding agent may be required to impose backup withholding on any payments of such amounts at a rate of 24% unless such U.S. Holder (i) establishes that it is a corporation or comes within certain other exempt categories, or (ii) provides a correct taxpayer identification number, certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Each U.S. Holder may provide its correct taxpayer identification number and certify that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding by completing IRS Form W-9. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from such payments may be allowed as a credit against such U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability or may entitle such U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

Subject to the discussions of backup withholding and FATCA below, payments of interest to a Non-U.S. Holder that is not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business carried on by the Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax, provided that: - the Non-U.S. Holder does not own, actually or constructively, 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote; - the Non-U.S. Holder is not a “controlled foreign corporation” related to us through stock ownership; - the Non-U.S. Holder is not a bank that is receiving the interest on an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business; and - either (1) the Non-U.S. Holder provides an appropriate IRS Form W-8 (or a suitable substitute or successor form or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) that has been properly completed and duly executed establishing its status as a Non-U.S. Holder or (2) the Non-U.S. Holder holds its Notes through certain foreign intermediaries or certain foreign partnerships and the Non-U.S. Holder and such intermediary or partnership satisfy the certification requirements of applicable Treasury regulations.

If a Non-U.S. Holder cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest on a Note paid to a Non-U.S. Holder that are not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business carried on by the Non-U.S. Holder, will generally be subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a 30% rate (unless the rate is reduced under an applicable income tax treaty and the Non-U.S. Holder claims the benefit of that treaty by providing an applicable IRS Form W-8 (or a suitable substitute or successor form or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) that has been properly completed and duly executed). 109 ----- If interest paid to a Non-U.S. Holder on a Note is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States, then the Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such amounts generally in the same manner as if such Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder, unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. In addition, if the Non-U.S. Holder is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Non-U.S. Holder may be subject to a branch profits tax on its effectively connected earnings and profits, subject to adjustments, at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty). Sale, Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes. Subject to the discussions of backup withholding and FATCA below, a Non-U.S. Holder will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note (other than any amount representing accrued but unpaid interest on the Note, which is subject to the rules discussed above under “Ownership of the Notes by Non-U.S. Holders—Payments of Interest on the Notes”) unless: - the gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. by the Non-U.S. Holder; or - in the case of a Non-U.S. Holder who is a nonresident alien individual, such holder is present in the United States for 183 or more days in the taxable year of the taxable disposition and certain other requirements are met. If a Non-U.S. Holder falls under the first of these exceptions, then unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise, the holder will be taxed on the net gain derived from the disposition of the Note generally in the same manner as if such Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it may also be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or lower applicable treaty rate) of the holder’s effectively connected earnings and profits, subject to certain adjustments. If an individual Non-U.S. Holder falls under the second of these exceptions, the holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (unless a lower applicable treaty rate applies) on the amount by which the capital gain derived from the disposition exceeds certain of such holder’s capital losses allocable to sources within the United States. _Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_ The amount of interest on a Note paid to a Non-U.S. Holder and the amount of tax, if any, withheld from such payment generally must be reported annually to the Non-U.S. Holder and to the IRS. The IRS may make this information available under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty or agreement to the tax authorities in the country in which the Non-U.S. Holder is resident or established. Provided that a Non-U.S. Holder has complied with certain reporting procedures (usually satisfied by providing an applicable properly completed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E) or otherwise establishes an exemption, the Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to backup withholding tax with respect to interest payments on a Note. Rules relating to information reporting requirements and backup withholding with respect to the payment of proceeds from the taxable disposition (including a redemption or retirement) of a Note are as follows: - If the proceeds are paid to or through the United States office of a broker, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to backup withholding and information reporting unless the Non-U.S. Holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is not a U.S. person (usually on an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E) or otherwise establishes an exemption. - If the proceeds are paid to or through a non-U.S. office of a broker that is not a U.S. person and is not a person that has certain specified U.S. connections (a “U.S. Related Person”), a Non-U.S. 110 ----- Holder will not be subject to backup withholding or information reporting. - If the proceeds are paid to or through a non-U.S. office of a broker that is a U.S. person or a U.S. Related Person, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to information reporting (but generally not backup withholding) unless the Non-U.S. Holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is not a U.S. person (usually on an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E) or otherwise establishes an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a credit against the Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, or may entitle the Non-U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the backup withholding rules in their particular circumstances and the availability of, and procedure for, obtaining an exemption from backup withholding under current Treasury regulations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,134

An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and the applicable foreign country, or future U.S. Treasury regulations or other guidance, may modify these requirements. Under proposed U.S. Treasury regulations that may be relied upon pending finalization, the withholding tax on gross proceeds would be eliminated and, consequently, FATCA withholding on gross proceeds is not expected to apply.

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation (direct or indirect) to an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of such ERISA Plan. In considering an investment of a portion of the assets of any Plan in the Notes, a fiduciary (taking into account the facts and circumstances of the Plan) should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws. A fiduciary can be personally liable for losses incurred by a Plan resulting from a breach of fiduciary duties and can be subject to other adverse consequences. Each Plan should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, any of the Guarantors, the initial purchasers or any of their respective affiliates will act as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the decision to acquire the Notes and is not undertaking to provide any advice or recommendation, including, without limitation, in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to such decision.",N/A,as_expected,2020,134

A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. Plans that are “governmental plans” (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain “church plans” (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) are not subject to the requirements of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code but may be subject to similar provisions under applicable Similar Laws. The acquisition and/or holding of the Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which we, any of the Guarantors or the initial purchasers are considered a party in interest or disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or PTCEs, that may apply to provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14, as amended, respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1, respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38, respecting bank-maintained collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60, respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23, respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions between an ERISA Plan and a person that is a party in interest or 112 ----- disqualified person solely by reason of providing services to the ERISA Plan or a relationship with such service provider, provided that neither the person transacting with the ERISA Plan nor an affiliate exercises any discretionary authority or control with respect to the assets of the ERISA Plan involved in the transaction or renders investment advice with respect to such assets, and provided further that the ERISA Plan pays no more than and receives no less than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction.

In addition, a fiduciary of an ERISA Plan that engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code.

These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. DTC has advised us that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants. DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it: 114 ----- (1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and (2) ownership of these interests in Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in Global Notes). Investors in Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants in DTC’s system may hold their interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) that are Participants in DTC. All interests in a Global Note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Investors in Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of Euroclear, and Citibank, N.A., as operator of Clearstream which in turn hold such interests in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’ names on the books of DTC. Interests in a Global Note held through Euroclear or Clearstream may be subject to the procedures and requirements of those systems (as well as to the procedures and requirements of DTC). The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own and the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to Persons that are subject to those requirements will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge those interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of those interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing those interests. Except as described below, owners of an interest in Global Notes will not have Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of definitive notes in registered certificated form (“Certificated Notes”) and will not be considered the registered owners or “Holders” thereof under the Indenture for any purpose. Payments in respect of the principal of and premium and interest on a Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered Holder under the Indenture. Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the Persons in whose names Notes, including Global Notes, are registered as the owners of such Notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither the Issuer, the Trustee or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for: (1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes; or (2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants. DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the Notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on that payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of Notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its Participants in 115 ----- identifying the beneficial owners of any Notes, and the Issuer and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes. Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between Participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes described herein, cross-market transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by its respective depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note from DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a Holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of the portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes as to which that Participant or those Participants has or have given the relevant direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the Notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute those Notes to its Participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in Global Notes among Participants, they are under no obligation to perform those procedures, and may discontinue or change those procedures at any time.

Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ....................................................................................................... Total ..................................................................................................................................... $ 500,000,000 The purchase agreement provides that the obligations of the initial purchasers to purchase the Notes are subject to approval of legal matters by counsel and to other conditions. The initial purchasers must purchase all the Notes if they purchase any of the Notes. The initial purchasers propose to resell the Notes at the offering price set forth on the cover page of this Offering Circular within the United States to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A) in reliance on Rule 144A and outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S. The price at which the Notes are offered may be changed at any time without notice. The initial purchasers may offer and sell Notes through certain of their respective affiliates. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S) except in transactions exempt from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a dealer that is not participating in this offering may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if that offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A. We have agreed that, during the period from the date of this Offering Circular through and including the date that is 60 days after the date of this Offering Circular, we and the Guarantors will not, without the prior written consent of Credit Suisse, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities issued or guaranteed by us or any of the Guarantors having a tenor of more than one year. The Notes will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to list the Notes on any securities exchange or automated inter-dealer quotation system. We cannot assure you that the prices at which the Notes will sell in the market after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering prices or that an active trading market for the Notes will develop and continue after this offering. The initial purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the Notes. However, they are not obligated to do so and they may discontinue any market-making activities with respect to the Notes at any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of, or the trading market for, the Notes. In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell Notes in the open market. Purchases and sales in the open market may include short sales, purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases: - Short sales involve secondary market sales by the initial purchasers of a greater number of Notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. - Covering transactions involve purchases of Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. 121 ----- - Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase Notes so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases, as well as other purchases by the initial purchasers for their own account, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes. They may also cause the price of the Notes to be higher than the price that would otherwise exist in the open market in the absence of these transactions. The initial purchasers may conduct these transactions in the over-thecounter market or otherwise. If the initial purchasers commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them at any time. The initial purchasers are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates have in the past performed commercial banking, investment banking and advisory services for us from time to time for which they have received customary fees and reimbursement of expenses and may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform services for us in the ordinary course of their business for which they may receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (which may include bank loans and/or credit default swaps) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers and may at any time hold long and short positions in such securities and instruments. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. Certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates that have a lending relationship with us may hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. A typical such hedging strategy includes the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates hedging such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. Certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates may be holders of our 2024 Secured Notes and will receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering in connection with the redemption of the 2024 Secured Notes. In addition, certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates are lenders and/or agents under our ABL Facility and have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for transactions under our ABL Facility. We have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to make because of any of those liabilities. We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on February , 2020, which will be the business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement being referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes prior to the date that is two business days preceding the settlement date will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially settle in T+, to specify an alternative settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes which wish to trade the Notes during such period should consult their advisors.",N/A,as_expected,2020,134
