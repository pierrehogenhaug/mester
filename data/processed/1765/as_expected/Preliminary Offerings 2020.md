Builders FirstSource, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Issuer,” “we,” “our” or “us”), is offering $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its   % senior
notes due 2030 (the “Notes”).


The Notes will mature on        , 2030 and will bear interest at the rate of   % per year. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears
on         and         of each year, beginning on        , 2020.

The Notes will be redeemable in whole or in part at any time on or after          , 2025. Up to 40% of the Notes will also be redeemable with the
proceeds of certain equity offerings completed before           , 2023. The redemption prices and payment of any accrued and unpaid interest are described
under “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.” At any time prior to           , 2025, the Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption, plus a
“make-whole” premium. If we experience a Change of Control (as defined in “Description of the Notes”) or receive proceeds from certain asset sales, holders of
the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase the Notes under the terms set forth herein.

The Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis (the “Guarantees”), by each of the Issuer’s
subsidiaries that guarantee its obligations under the senior secured term loan facility (the “First-Lien Facility”) and the senior secured ABL facility (the “ABL
Facility” and, together with the First-Lien Facility, the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”) (the “Guarantors”). Subject to certain exceptions, future subsidiaries of
the Issuer that guarantee the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or certain other indebtedness will also guarantee the Notes.


The Notes and the Guarantees will be general senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors, pari passu in right of payment with any existing
and future senior indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the 6.750% senior secured
notes due 2027 (the “2027 Secured Notes”). The Notes and the Guarantees will be senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of the Issuer
and the Guarantors and effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors (including indebtedness under the

The Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including preferred stock, of the
Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.

The Notes will not have the benefit of any registration rights and we have no intention to register the Notes in the future.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with borrowing under our ABL Facility, to redeem all of the outstanding aggregate principal
amount of our 5.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Secured Notes”) and to pay related transaction premiums, fees and expenses. See “Use of
Proceeds.”

**Investing in the Notes involves risks. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 12.**

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on, 2020, which will
be the business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement being referred to as “T+ ”).
Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), trades in the
secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly
agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes prior to the date that is two business days
preceding the settlement date will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially settle in T+, to
specify an alternative settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers
of the Notes which wish to trade the Notes during such period should consult their advisors.

We have prepared this Offering Circular solely for use in connection with the proposed offering of the
Notes described herein. This Offering Circular is confidential and personal to each prospective investor and does not
constitute an offer to any other person or to the public generally to subscribe for or otherwise acquire securities.
Distribution of this Offering Circular to any person other than the prospective investor and any person retained to
advise such prospective investor with respect to its purchase is unauthorized, and disclosure of its contents, in whole
or in part, without our prior written consent, is prohibited. Each prospective investor, by accepting delivery of this

reference is made to the actual documents for complete information. All such summaries are qualified in their
entirety by such reference. Copies of documents referred to herein will be made available to prospective investors
upon request to the initial purchasers or us.

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state

resale and may not be transferred or resold except in a transaction exempt from or not subject to the registration
requirements of the Securities Act or pursuant to an effective registration statement. Each purchaser of the Notes

on transfer and resale as more fully described under the heading “Transfer Restrictions.”

We reserve the right to withdraw this offering of Notes at any time and we and the initial purchasers
reserve the right to reject any commitment to subscribe for the Notes in whole or in part and to allot each
prospective investor less than the full amount of Notes subscribed for by such investor.

reference that are not historical facts are hereby identified as “forward-looking statements” for the purpose of the
safe harbor provided by Section 21E of the Exchange Act, and Section 27A of the Securities Act. These forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements, including

 • our incurrence of additional indebtedness and our inability to take certain actions because of
restrictions in our debt agreements;

##### • rising interest rates, which could cause our variable indebtedness service obligations to increase
significantly, including as a result of increased interest rates on borrowings under our Senior Secured
Credit Facilities that may be impacted by the phase out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (also
known as “LIBOR”);

##### • loss of significant customers;

iv


-----

##### • variability of our quarterly revenues and earnings;

 • exposure to product liability, product warranty, casualty, construction defect, asbestos, vehicle and
other liability claims;

##### • our ability to renew long-term leases for our facilities;

 • our reliance on our subsidiaries;

 • disruptions in our information technology systems;

 • cybersecurity risks and the costs we may incur to minimize those risks;

 • payment-related risks;

 • natural or man-made disruptions to our distribution and manufacturing facilities;

 • our ability to execute our strategic plans;

 • effects of regulatory conditions on our operations;

 • recently enacted tax legislation and future changes to tax laws and regulations;

 • exposure to environmental liabilities and regulation;

 • economic and financial uncertainty resulting from terrorism and war;

 • the unionization of some of our employees; and

 • the price of our common stock is volatile.

Many of the important factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict.
You are cautioned not to put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of
this Offering Circular or, in the case of documents incorporated by reference, as of the date of such documents.
Except as otherwise required by law, we do not assume any obligation to publicly update or release any revisions to

_______________

**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**

We have included certain financial measures in this Offering Circular that have not been calculated in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) in order to provide
investors with an alternative method for assessing our operating results in a manner that enables investors to more
thoroughly evaluate our current performance as compared to past performance. We also believe these non-GAAP
measures provide investors with a better baseline for modeling our future earnings expectations. Our management
uses these non-GAAP measures for the same purpose. We believe that our investors should have access to the same
set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to
results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP
results. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled
measures reported by other companies. We have provided a definition below for these non-GAAP financial
measures, together with an explanation of why management uses these measures and why management believes that
these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors. For a reconciliation between these non-GAAP financial
measures to the most closely comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, please see
“Summary—Summary Historical Financial and Other Data.”

We define Adjusted EBITDA as GAAP net income before depreciation and amortization, interest expense,
income taxes, gain (loss) on sale of assets, (income) loss from closed locations, and other non-cash or special items
including asset impairments, facility closure costs, acquisition costs, severance, conversion, transaction and
integration costs, and stock compensation expense. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental
measure in the evaluation of our business and believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of our
performance because it eliminates the effects of period to period changes in taxes, costs associated with capital
investments, interest expense, stock compensation expense and other non-cash and non-recurring items. Adjusted
EBITDA is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, it should not be considered
in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. When
evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, investors should consider, among other factors, (i) increasing or decreasing trends in
Adjusted EBITDA, (ii) whether Adjusted EBITDA has remained at positive levels historically, and (iii) how
Adjusted EBITDA compares to our debt outstanding. We provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP
net income. Because Adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income and may vary
among companies, Adjusted EBITDA presented by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other
companies. Adjusted EBITDA does not give effect to the cash we must use to service our debt or pay income taxes
and thus does not reflect the funds generated from or used in operations or actually available for capital investments.
We define free cash flow as GAAP net cash from operating activities net of purchases of property, plant and
equipment. Our management uses free cash flow as a supplemental measure in the evaluation of our business as we
believe it provides a meaningful evaluation of our liquidity. Free cash flow is not a financial measure calculated in
accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net cash flow
from operations or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

_subsidiaries and (ii) the “Issuer” refers to Builders FirstSource, Inc. and not to any of its subsidiaries. This_
_summary highlights selected information contained elsewhere in this Offering Circular or incorporated by reference_
_into this Offering Circular._

_This summary does not contain all of the information that you should consider before investing in the Notes._
_You should read the entire Offering Circular and the incorporated documents carefully, including the section_
_entitled “Risk Factors” in this Offering Circular and the information in the documents incorporated by reference_
_herein, before making a decision to invest in the Notes._

**Business Overview**

We are a leading supplier and manufacturer of building materials, manufactured components and
construction services to professional homebuilders, sub-contractors, remodelers and consumers. We operate
approximately 400 locations in 40 states across the United States. We offer an integrated solution to our customers
providing manufacturing, supply and installation of a full range of structural and related building products. Our
manufactured products include our factory-built roof and floor trusses, wall panels and stairs, vinyl windows,
custom millwork and trim, as well as engineered wood that we design, cut, and assemble specifically for each home.
We also assemble interior and exterior doors into pre-hung units. Additionally, we supply our customers with a
broad offering of professional grade building products not manufactured by us, such as dimensional lumber and
lumber sheet goods and various window, door and millwork lines. Our full range of construction-related services
includes professional installation, turn-key framing and shell construction, spanning all of our product categories.

**Our Strengths**

**_We are a market leader in a highly fragmented industry_**

We are a leading supplier and manufacturer of building materials, manufactured components and
construction services to professional homebuilders, sub-contractors, remodelers and consumers, and we are the
largest building supplier with manufacturing capabilities, according to ProSales magazine’s 2019 ProSales 100 list,
with $7.3 billion of sales generated over the last twelve months ended September 30, 2019. Many of our competitors
are small, privately owned businesses with limited product offerings, access to capital and information technology
infrastructure. We are able to maintain a competitive advantage over these smaller competitors by creating
economies of scale that enable us to supply our customers cost-effectively. We believe we are well positioned to
capture market share from smaller, local distributors that lack scale, allowing us to retain our market-leading
position.

**_We maintain strong diversification across geographies, customers and end markets_**

We have a diverse geographic footprint, as we have operations in 77 of the top 100 U.S. Metropolitan
Statistical Areas, as ranked by single family housing permits based on available 2018 U.S. Census data. We also
serve a broad customer base, ranging from large production builders to small custom homebuilders, as well as multifamily builders, repair and remodeling contractors and light commercial contractors. For the year ended December
31, 2018, our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 16.8% of sales, and no single customer accounted for
more than 5% of sales.

**_Strong free cash flow generation with history of deleveraging_**

Our differentiated, industry-leading platform with expanded use of technology and automation has enabled
us to drive exceptional growth in net cash flow generation. Over the last few years, we have focused on sales of high
margin value-added products, which have translated to improved profitability. Free cash flow was $181.4 million for
the year ended December 31, 2018 and $282.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. We have also

1


-----

used our cash flow towards active debt repayment since the ProBuild acquisition, resulting in a decrease in our total
leverage ratio, net from 6.2x as of December 31, 2015 to 2.6x as of September 30, 2019 on an as adjusted basis,
after giving effect to the Transactions (as defined below). See “—Summary Historical Financial and Other Data.”
As such, we were able to deliver on a key leverage milestone of 2.5x to 3.5x set in 2015.

Total leverage ratio, net represents our total long-term debt, net of cash and cash equivalents, divided by
our Adjusted EBITDA. We use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure in the evaluation of our business and
believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of our performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not a
financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, it should not be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for net income or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We provide a
reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income in “—Summary Historical Financial and Other Data”
below. We use free cash flow as a supplemental measure in the evaluation of our business as we believe it provides
a meaningful evaluation of our liquidity. Free cash flow is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with
GAAP. Accordingly, it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net cash flow from operations or
other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more
information on limitations of non-GAAP financial measures.

**_Our seasoned management team has deep industry experience_**

Our management team has extensive functional and industry experience with leadership developed
internally as well as recruited externally. The team has successfully led the Company through industry cycles,
including the 2009 housing crisis. Since inception, our leadership team has successfully integrated numerous
acquisitions. Chad Crow, our President and Chief Executive Officer, joined the Company in September 1999 and
served as Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer prior to assuming his current responsibilities in
December 2017. Peter Jackson, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has significant experience in
financial leadership positions including his prior roles at Lennox International, Inc., SPX Corporation, General
Electric and Gerber Scientific.

On January 10, 2020, Mr. Crow notified our Board of Directors (the “Board”) of his decision to retire as
President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company during 2020 after assisting our Board in hiring his
replacement. See “—Recent Developments.”

**Our Strategies**

**_Leverage our competitive strengths to capitalize on growth in the housing market_**

As the U.S. housing market returns to a historically normalized level, we intend to leverage our core
business strengths including size, national footprint, unmatched scale in manufacturing capability, breadth of
product portfolio, and end market exposure to expand our sales and profit margins. Our customers continue to
emphasize the importance of competitive pricing, a broad product portfolio, sales force knowledge, labor-saving
manufactured products, on-site services and overall “ease of use” with their building products suppliers. Our
comprehensive product offering, experienced sales force, strong strategic vendor relationships, and tenured senior
management team position us well to capitalize on strong demand in the new home construction market and the
repair and remodel segment. Our large delivery fleet, professional drivers, and comprehensive inventory
management enable us to provide “just-in-time” product delivery, ensuring a smoother and faster production cycle
for the homebuilder. Our comprehensive network of products, services and facilities provides a strategically
advantaged service model which enhances our value to our customers and provides a strong platform to drive
growth.

**_Maximize our share of wallet by capturing above-market growth in our higher margin value added products_**

We believe our national manufacturing footprint and differentiated capabilities will allow us to capture
growth in our higher margin value-added products with single family homebuilders. We believe our value-added
products address the growing demand for ways to build homes more efficiently, addressing labor constraints and
rising costs. We plan to accelerate this growth by further expansion of our national manufacturing footprint to serve

2


-----

locations that do not currently have adequate access to these high margin products. By focusing on our differentiated
platform and broad product mix, we are able to offer a complete array of products and services that would otherwise
need to be sourced from various distributors, providing us an opportunity to capture a greater share of wallet. This
operational platform often will make us a preferred distributor for large scale national homebuilders as well as local
and custom homebuilders looking for more efficient ways to build a home. We believe that customers continue to
place an increased value on these capabilities, which further differentiates us from our competitors.

**_Optimize our highly scalable cost structure with operational excellence initiatives_**

We continue to focus on standardizing processes and technology-based workflows to minimize costs,
streamline our operations and enhance working capital efficiency. We are implementing operational excellence
initiatives that are designed to further improve efficiency as well as customer service. We expect these initiatives,
including distribution and logistics, pricing and margin management, back office efficiencies, customer integration
and systems-enabled process improvements, to yield significant cost savings. The scope and scale of our existing
infrastructure, customer base, and logistical capabilities mean that improvements in efficiency, when replicated

**Summary Historical Financial and Other Data**

The following tables set forth summary historical financial information for the Company for the periods
ended and as of the dates indicated. The Company’s financial information for and as of the years ended December
31, 2018 and 2017 and for the year ended December 31, 2016 has been derived from, and should be read in
conjunction with, the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto
incorporated by reference into this Offering Circular.

The Company’s financial information for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 and as of
September 30, 2019 has been derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the Company’s unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto incorporated by reference into this
Offering Circular. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on a basis consistent with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements
and include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the
results for the unaudited interim periods.

The Company’s unaudited condensed combined financial information for the twelve months (“LTM”)
ended September 30, 2019, which does not comply with GAAP but we believe provides investors with useful
information to assess our performance, has been derived by adding the Company’s audited statement of operations
information for the year ended December 31, 2018 to the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated statement
of operations information for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and subtracting the Company’s unaudited
condensed consolidated statement of operations information for the nine months ended September 30, 2018.

Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future.

(1) We define Adjusted EBITDA as GAAP net income before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income taxes,
gain (loss) on sale of assets, (income) loss from closed locations, and other non-cash or special items including asset
impairments, facility closure costs, acquisition costs, severance, conversion, transaction and integration costs, and stock
compensation expense. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure in the evaluation of our
business and believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of our performance because it eliminates the
effects of period to period changes in taxes, costs associated with capital investments, interest expense, stock compensation
expense and other non-cash and non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure calculated in accordance
with GAAP. Accordingly, it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other financial
measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income
below. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information on limitations of non-GAAP financial measures.

When evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, investors should consider, among other factors, (i) increasing or decreasing trends in
Adjusted EBITDA, (ii) whether Adjusted EBITDA has remained at positive levels historically, and (iii) how Adjusted
EBITDA compares to our debt outstanding. We provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income.
Because Adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income and may vary among companies,
Adjusted EBITDA presented by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted
EBITDA does not give effect to the cash we must use to service our debt or pay income taxes and thus does not reflect the
funds generated from or used in operations or actually available for capital investments.

The following table is a reconciliation of our GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDA:

**RISK FACTORS**

_In addition to the other information set forth and incorporated by reference in this Offering Circular,_
_including, without limitation, the “Risk Factors” included in the Issuer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal_
_year ended December 31, 2018 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2019, you_
_should carefully consider the following risk factors before deciding to invest in the Notes. If any of the risks_
_described below or in the documents incorporated by reference actually occurs, our business, business prospects,_
_financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In any such case, the_
_value of the Notes could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks below and those_
_incorporated by reference in this Offering Circular are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not currently_
_known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect us. This Offering Circular also contains_
_forward-looking statements, estimates and projections that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could_
_differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including_
_the risks described below and in the documents incorporated by reference in this Offering Circular._

**Risks Relating to our Indebtedness and the Notes**

**_Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the Notes._**

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of September 30, 2019, on an as adjusted basis after
giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had approximately $1,420.6 million of total debt outstanding,
including $500.0 million of the Notes offered hereby and $920.6 million of total secured debt outstanding
(consisting of $157.1 million of borrowings under the First-Lien Facility, $47.0 million of borrowings under the
ABL Facility, with $766.5 million of additional availability (subject to availability under a borrowing base and after
giving effect to $82.2 million of letters of credit outstanding as of September 30, 2019) thereunder, $475.0 million
aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2027 Secured Notes and $241.5 million of other finance
obligations and finance lease obligations). In addition, we had $292.8 million in operating lease obligations as of
September 30, 2019.

Our substantial debt could have important consequences to us, including:

   - increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;

   - requiring a substantial portion of our operating cash flow to be dedicated to the payment of principal and
interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our liquidity and our ability to use our cash flow to fund
our operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities;

   - exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates, and corresponding increased interest expense, because
borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are at variable rates of interest;

   - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service
requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;

   - limiting our ability to adjust to changing marketplace conditions and placing us at a competitive
disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have less debt; or

   - limiting our attractiveness as an investment opportunity for potential investors.

In addition, some of our debt instruments, including those governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
and the 2027 Secured Notes, contain cross-default provisions that could result in our debt being declared
immediately due and payable under a number of debt instruments, even if we default on only one debt instrument. In
such event, it is unlikely that we would be able to satisfy our obligations under all of such accelerated indebtedness
simultaneously.

Our financial condition and operating performance, including that of our subsidiaries, are also subject to
prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our
control. There are no assurances that we will maintain a level of liquidity sufficient to permit us to pay the principal,
premium and interest on our indebtedness, including the Notes.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be
forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our
indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt
service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity
problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations in an effort to meet our debt service and
other obligations. The 2027 Secured Notes Indenture (as defined below) and the agreements governing the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities restrict, and the Indenture will restrict, our ability to dispose of assets and to use the
proceeds from such dispositions. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or be able to obtain the
proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service
obligations then due, including payments on the Notes.

In addition, any borrowings under the ABL Facility will be secured indebtedness and therefore would be
effectively senior to the Notes offered hereby and the Guarantees to the extent of the assets securing such
indebtedness. See “Use of Proceeds” and “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness.”

**_We are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt_**
**_service obligations, including payments on the Notes._**

We are a holding company and derive all of our operating income from our subsidiaries. All of our assets
are held by our direct and indirect subsidiaries. We rely on the earnings and cash flows of our subsidiaries, which
are paid to us by our subsidiaries in the form of dividends and other payments or distributions, to meet our debt
service obligations, including payments on the Notes. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other
payments or distributions to us will depend on their respective operating results and may be restricted by, among
other things, the laws of their jurisdiction of organization (which may limit the amount of funds available for the
payment of dividends and other distributions to us), the terms of existing and future indebtedness and other
agreements of our subsidiaries, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the terms of the Indenture and the 2027 Secured
Notes Indenture and the covenants of any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur.

**_If the Notes become rated investment grade by two of S&P, Moody’s or Fitch, certain covenants will not be_**
**_applicable and Guarantees may be released._**

Certain covenants in the Indenture will be suspended and the Guarantees may be released if the Notes are
rated investment grade by two of the ratings agencies and no default or event of default has otherwise occurred and
is continuing under the Indenture. If the Notes are subsequently downgraded below investment grade, such
covenants and such Guarantees will be reinstated. The covenants that would be suspended include, among others,
limitations on our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends, make restricted payments, incur
indebtedness, sell certain assets and enter into certain other transactions. Any actions that we take while these
covenants are not in force will be permitted even if the covenants are subsequently reinstated. There can be no
assurance that the Notes will ever be rated investment grade, or that if they are rated investment grade, the Notes
will maintain such ratings.

**_We may not be able to satisfy our obligations to holders of the Notes upon a Change of Control._**

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder of the Notes will have the right to require us to
purchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount thereof, together with any accrued and unpaid
interest. Our failure to purchase, or to give notice of purchase of, the Notes would be a default under the Indenture,
which would in turn be a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the 2027 Secured Notes Indenture.
In addition, a Change of Control may constitute an event of default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and
the 2027 Secured Notes Indenture. An event of default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or the 2027
Secured Notes Indenture may result in an event of default under the Indenture if the lenders accelerate the debt
under either of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or the debt under the 2027 Secured Notes Indenture is
accelerated. Any of our future debt agreements may contain similar provisions.

If a Change of Control occurs, we may not have enough assets to satisfy all obligations under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities, the 2027 Secured Notes and the Notes. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control we
could seek to refinance the indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the 2027 Secured Notes and the

13


-----

Notes or obtain a waiver from the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the holders of the 2027
Secured Notes and/or the holders of the Notes. We cannot assure you, however, that we would be able to obtain a
waiver or refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. No assurances can be given that
any court would enforce the Change of Control provisions in the Indenture as written for the benefit of the holders,
or as to how these Change of Control provisions would be impacted were we to become a debtor in a bankruptcy
case.

**_We may enter into transactions that would not constitute a Change of Control that could affect our ability to_**
**_satisfy our obligations under the Notes._**

Legal uncertainty regarding what constitutes a Change of Control and the provisions of the Indenture may
allow us to enter into transactions, such as acquisitions, refinancings or recapitalizations, that would not constitute a
Change of Control but may increase our outstanding indebtedness or otherwise affect our ability to satisfy our
obligations under the Notes. The definition of Change of Control for purposes of the Notes includes a phrase relating
to the transfer of “all or substantially all” of our assets taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable
law. Accordingly, your ability to require the Issuer to repurchase Notes as a result of a transfer of less than all of our
assets to another person may be uncertain. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

**_The agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us and_**
**_certain of our subsidiaries that may affect our ability to operate our businesses._**

The agreements that govern our indebtedness contain, and the Indenture will contain, various affirmative
and negative covenants that may, subject to certain significant exceptions, restrict the ability of us and certain of our
subsidiaries to, among other things, have liens on our property and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or
sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person. The ability of us and our subsidiaries to comply with these
provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an
event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations.

**_The Notes are structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of certain of our subsidiaries that will not_**
**_guarantee the Notes._**

We and each of our subsidiaries that guarantees the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will initially guarantee
the Notes. The Notes will not be guaranteed by certain of our existing and future subsidiaries. Claims of holders of
the Notes will be structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors of these non-Guarantor subsidiaries, including
trade creditors, and will not be satisfied from the assets of these non-Guarantor subsidiaries until their creditors are
paid in full. In addition, the Guarantee of a Guarantor will be released in connection with a transfer of such
Guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the Indenture or upon certain other events described in “Description of
the Notes—Guarantees.”

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, those of our subsidiaries that will not serve as
Guarantors accounted for a de minimis percentage of our sales, total assets and total liabilities.

The Indenture will, subject to some limitations, permit these non-Guarantor subsidiaries to incur additional
debt and will not limit their ability to incur other liabilities that are not considered indebtedness under the Indenture,
such as trade payables.

**_The Notes are unsecured and will be effectively subordinated to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the_**
**_2027 Secured Notes, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and_**
**_the 2027 Secured Notes._**

Our obligations under the Notes will be unsecured and will be effectively subordinated to our secured
indebtedness (including indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the 2027 Secured Notes) to the
extent of the value of the collateral securing such secured indebtedness. Borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities and the 2027 Secured Notes are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and any existing and
future guarantors.

14


-----

If an event of default occurs under the 2027 Secured Notes Indenture or the agreements governing the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the holders of such senior secured indebtedness will have a prior right to our
secured assets, to the exclusion of the holders of the Notes, even if we are in default with respect to the Notes. In
that event, our secured assets would first be used to repay in full all indebtedness and other obligations secured by
them (including all amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the 2027 Secured Notes),
resulting in all or a portion of our assets being unavailable to satisfy the claims of the holders of the Notes and other
unsecured indebtedness. Therefore, in the event of any distribution or payment of our assets in any foreclosure,
dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, or other bankruptcy proceeding, holders of the Notes will
participate in our remaining assets ratably with each other and with all holders of our unsecured indebtedness that is
deemed to be of the same class as such notes, and potentially with all of our other general creditors, based upon the
respective amounts owed to each holder or creditor. In any of the foregoing events, we cannot assure you that there
will be sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the Notes. As a result, holders of such notes may receive less,
ratably, than holders of secured indebtedness.

As of September 30, 2019, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, (i) we would have
had approximately $1,420.6 million of total debt outstanding, all of which ranks pari passu in right of payment with
the Notes, and (ii) the Notes would be effectively subordinated to $920.6 million of total secured debt outstanding
(consisting of $157.1 million of borrowings under the First-Lien Facility, $47.0 million of borrowings under the
ABL Facility, with $766.5 million of additional availability (subject to availability under a borrowing base and after
giving effect to $82.2 million of letters of credit outstanding as of September 30, 2019) thereunder, $475.0 million
aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2027 Secured Notes and $241.5 million of other finance
obligations and finance lease obligations) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The
Indenture will also permit us to incur additional secured indebtedness, which could be substantial.

**_Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void Notes and require noteholders to_**
**_return payments received._**

If we become a debtor in a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or encounter other financial difficulty
under federal or state fraudulent transfer laws, a court may void or otherwise decline to enforce the Notes. A court
might do so if it found that when we issued the Notes, or in some states when payments became due under the
Notes, we received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and:

   - were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;

   - were left with inadequate capital to conduct our business;

   - believed or reasonably should have believed that we would incur debts beyond our ability to pay; or

   - were a defendant in an action for money damages or had a judgment for money damages docketed
against us if, in either case, the judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment.

The court might also void the issuance of the Notes, without regard to the above factors, if the court found
that we issued the Notes with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its creditors.

A court would likely find that we did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the
Notes if we did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes. If a court were to void
the issuance of the Notes you would no longer have any claim against us. Sufficient funds to repay the Notes may
not be available from other sources, including the remaining obligors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you
to repay any amounts that you already received from us. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or
conveyance occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the Notes. Further, the avoidance of the Notes could
result in an event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other debt, which could result in acceleration of
that debt. The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws will vary depending upon the
law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, we
would be considered insolvent if:

   - the sum of our debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of our
assets;

15


-----

   - if the present fair saleable value of our assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay our
probable liability on our existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and
mature; or

   - we could not pay our debts as they become due.

On the basis of historical financial information, recent operating history and other factors, we believe that
we, after giving effect to these Notes, will not be insolvent, will not have unreasonably small capital for the business
in which we are engaged and will not have incurred debts beyond our ability to pay such debts as they mature. In
addition, we are not a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for money damages docketed
against us, for which the judgment was unsatisfied after final judgment. We cannot assure you, however, as to what
standard a court would apply in making these determinations or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this
regard.

Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the Notes to
other claims against us under the principle of equitable subordination if the court determines that (a) the holder of
Notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (b) the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other
creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of Notes and (c) equitable subordination is not
inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Guarantees will be_**
**_released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the trustee._**

The Guarantees may be released if the Notes are rated investment grade; provided, however, that if the
Notes are subsequently downgraded below investment grade the Guarantees may be reinstated. See “Description of
the Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.”

In addition, the Guarantee of a Guarantor will be released in connection with a sale of such Guarantor in a
transaction not prohibited by the Indenture.

The Indenture will also permit us to designate one or more of our restricted subsidiaries that is a Guarantor
of the Notes as an unrestricted subsidiary. If we designate a Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary, any Guarantees
of the Notes by such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries will be released under the Indenture. In addition, the
creditors of any unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have a senior claim on the assets of such unrestricted
subsidiary and its subsidiaries. See “Description of the Notes.”

**_The Guarantees provided by the Guarantors may not be enforceable and, under specific circumstances, federal_**
**_and state statutes may allow courts to void the Guarantees and require holders of Notes to return payments_**
**_received from Guarantors._**

Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, a guarantee
could be deemed a fraudulent transfer if the guarantor received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange
for giving the guarantee, and one of the following is also true:

   - such guarantor was insolvent on the date that it gave the guarantee or became insolvent as a result of
giving the guarantee;

   - such guarantor was engaged in business or a transaction, or was about to engage in business or a
transaction, for which property remaining with the guarantor was an unreasonably small capital; or

   - such guarantor intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts that would be beyond the
guarantor’s ability to pay as those debts matured.

A guarantee could also be deemed a fraudulent transfer if it was given with actual intent to hinder, delay or
defraud any entity to which the guarantor was or became, on or after the date the guarantee was given, indebted.

16


-----

The measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law
applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, a guarantor would be considered
insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:

   - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than all its assets, at a fair valuation;

   - the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and
mature; or

   - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

We cannot predict:

   - what standard a court would apply in order to determine whether a guarantor was insolvent as of the date
it issued a guarantee, or whether, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would determine that the
guarantor was insolvent on that date; or

   - whether a court would determine that the payments under a guarantee would constitute fraudulent
transfers or fraudulent conveyances on other grounds.

The Indenture will contain a “savings clause” intended to limit each Guarantor’s liability under its
Guarantee to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the Guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer
under applicable law. There can be no assurance that this provision will be upheld as intended. In 2009, the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of Florida in Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of TOUSA, Inc.
v. Citicorp N. Am., Inc. found this kind of provision in that case to be ineffective, and held the guarantees to be
fraudulent transfers and voided them in their entirety.

If a Guarantee is deemed to be a fraudulent transfer, it could be voided altogether, or it could be
subordinated to all other debts of the Guarantor. In such case, any payment by the Guarantor pursuant to its
Guarantee could be required to be returned to the Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the creditors of the
Guarantor. If a Guarantee is voided or held unenforceable for any other reason, holders of the Notes would cease to
have a claim against the Guarantor based on the Guarantee and would be creditors only of the Issuer and any
Guarantor whose Guarantee was not similarly voided or otherwise held unenforceable.

**_Certain actions in respect of defaults taken under the Indenture by beneficial owners with short positions in_**
**_excess of their interests in the Notes will be disregarded._**

By acceptance of the Notes, each holder of notes agrees, in connection with any notice of Default, notice of
acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other
action (a “Noteholder Direction”), to (i) deliver a written representation to the Issuer and the Trustee that such
holder and any of its affiliates acting in concert with it in connection with its investment in the Notes (other than
screened affiliates) are not (or, in the case such holder is DTC or its nominee, that such holder is being instructed
solely by beneficial owners that (together with such affiliates) are not) Net Short (as defined under “Description of
the Notes”) and (ii) provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to
time in order to verify the accuracy of such holder’s representation within five business days of request therefor.
Holders of the Notes, including holders that have hedged their exposure to the Notes in the ordinary course and not
for speculative purposes, may not be able to make such representations or provide the requested additional
information. These restrictions may impact a holder’s ability to participate in Noteholder Directions.

**_We may be unable to repay or repurchase the Notes at maturity._**

At maturity, the entire principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, will become due
and payable. We may not have the ability to repay or refinance these obligations. If the maturity date occurs at a
time when other arrangements prohibit us from repaying the Notes, we would try to obtain waivers of such
prohibitions from the lenders and holders under those arrangements, or we could attempt to refinance the borrowings

17


-----

that contain the restrictions. If we could not obtain the waivers or refinance these borrowings, we would be unable to
repay the Notes.

**_Holders of the Notes will not be entitled to registration rights and we do not currently intend to register the Notes_**
**_under applicable securities laws, and there are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the Notes._**

The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws and we do not currently intend to register the Notes or to offer to exchange the
Notes for notes registered under the Securities Act. The holders of the Notes will not be entitled to require us to
register the Notes for resale or otherwise. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the Notes in the United States only in
a transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment in the Notes for an indefinite period of
time. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**_An active trading market may not develop for the Notes._**

We cannot assure you that an active trading market will develop for the Notes. We do not intend to apply
for listing of the Notes on any securities exchange or on any automated dealer quotation system in the United States
or elsewhere.

The liquidity of, and trading market for, the Notes may also be adversely affected by, among other things:

   - changes in the overall market for securities similar to the Notes;

   - changes in our financial performance or prospects;

   - the prospects for companies in our industry generally;

   - the number of holders of the Notes;

   - the interest of securities dealers in making a market for the Notes;

   - the conditions of the financial markets; and

   - prevailing interest rates.

The condition of the financial markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are likely
to fluctuate in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Notes.

Subsequent to their initial issuance, the Notes may trade at a discount from their initial offering price,
depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our performance and other factors.

**_The trading price of the Notes may be volatile and can be directly affected by many factors, including our credit_**
**_rating._**

The trading price of the Notes could be subject to significant fluctuation in response to, among other
factors, changes in our operating results, interest rates, the market for non-investment grade securities, general
economic conditions and securities analysts’ recommendations, if any, regarding our securities. Credit rating
agencies continually revise their ratings for companies they follow, including us. Any ratings downgrade could
adversely affect the trading price of the Notes, or the trading market for the Notes, to the extent a trading market for
the Notes develops. The condition of the financial and credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in
the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future and any fluctuation may impact the trading price of the Notes.
Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial
volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. We cannot assure you that any such disruptions may not
adversely affect the prices at which you may sell your Notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the
Notes may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market
for similar Notes, our performance and other factors.

18


-----

**_You are responsible for determining the legality of your own investment._**

Investing in the Notes involves your acquisition of interests in a structure and in assets that may raise legal
issues for different classes of investors. You are responsible for determining whether you have the legal power,
authority and right to invest in the Notes. The Issuer, the initial purchasers and their affiliates express no view as to
your legal power, authority or right to invest in the Notes. You are urged to consult your own legal advisors as to
such matters. You must be able to make the representations and warranties under “Transfer Restrictions.”

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We expect that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $ million after deducting
the estimated discount to the initial purchasers. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with
borrowing under our ABL Facility, to redeem the 2024 Secured Notes and to pay related premiums, fees and
expenses.

The 2024 Secured Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.625% per annum and are scheduled to mature on
September 1, 2024. Loans under the ABL Facility bear interest, at the Company’s option, based on either the
eurodollar rate or base rate (a rate equal to the highest of an agreed benchmark rate commercially available, the
federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and the eurodollar rate plus 1.0%) plus, in each case, an applicable margin.
The applicable margin in respect of the loans under ABL Facility is (x) 1.75%, 1.50% or 1.25% in the case of
eurodollar rate loans (based on a measure of availability under the ABL Facility) and (y) 0.75%, 0.50% or 0.25% in
the case of base rate loans (based on a measure of availability under the ABL Facility). As amended, revolving loans
and swingline loans incurred under the ABL Facility will have a final maturity of November 22, 2023. See
“Description of Certain Other Indebtedness.”

Certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates may be holders of our 2024 Secured Notes and will
receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering in connection with the redemption of the 2024 Secured
Notes. In addition, certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates are lenders and/or agents under our ABL
Facility and have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for transactions under our
ABL Facility. See “Plan of Distribution.”

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

_The following is a summary of certain provisions of the instruments evidencing or that are expected to_
_evidence our material indebtedness. This summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is_
_qualified in its entirety by reference to, all of the provisions of the relevant agreements that are or are expected to_
_become effective._

**First-Lien Facility**

On July 31, 2015, the Company entered into a term loan credit agreement (the “Original First-Lien Credit
Agreement”) with Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as administrative agent and collateral agent and the
lenders and financial institutions party thereto. The Original First-Lien Credit Agreement provided for a seven-year
$600 million term loan facility. On August 22, 2016, the Company entered into an amended and restated term loan
credit agreement to refinance the term loans outstanding under the Original First-Lien Credit Agreement (the
“Amended and Restated First-Lien Credit Agreement”), and on February 23, 2017, the Company entered into a
second amended and restated term loan credit agreement which extended the term of the term loans outstanding
under the Amended and Restated First-Lien Credit Agreement to February 2024 (such credit facility, “First-Lien
Facility”). The following is a summary description of certain terms of the First-Lien Facility.

**_Maturity and Prepayments_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the First-Lien Facility is subject to mandatory pre-payments in amounts equal
to (1) 100% of the net cash proceeds from issuances or incurrence of debt by the Company or any of its restricted
subsidiaries (other than with respect to certain permitted indebtedness); (2) 100% of the net cash proceeds from
certain sales or other dispositions of assets by the Company or any of its restricted subsidiaries in excess of a certain
amount and subject to customary reinvestment provisions and certain other exceptions; and (3) 50% (with stepdowns to 25% and 0% based upon achievement of specified first lien net leverage ratios) of annual excess cash flow
of the Company and its subsidiaries subject to customary exceptions and limitations.

**_Security and Guarantees_**

All obligations under the First-Lien Facility are guaranteed jointly and severally by the Company and all
other subsidiaries that guarantee the 2024 Secured Notes. All obligations under the First-Lien Facility, and the
guarantees of those obligations, are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors
subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, including a first-priority security interest in such assets that
constitute Notes Collateral (as defined below) and a second-priority security interest in such assets that constitute
ABL Collateral (as defined below).

“ABL Collateral” includes substantially all presently owned and after-acquired accounts, inventory, rights
of unpaid vendor with respect to inventory, deposit accounts, investment property, cash and cash equivalents, and
instruments and chattel paper and general intangibles, books and records and documents related to and proceeds of
each of the foregoing.

“Notes Collateral” includes all collateral which is not ABL Collateral.

**_Interest_**

At the Company’s option, loans under the First-Lien Facility bear interest based on either the eurodollar
rate or base rate (a rate equal to the highest of an agreed benchmark rate commercially available, the federal funds
effective rate plus 0.50% and the eurodollar rate plus 1.0%) plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable
margin in respect of the loans under the First-Lien Facility is (x) 3.0% in the case of Eurodollar rate loans and (y)
2.0% in the case of base rate loans.

22


-----

**_Covenants and Other Matters_**

The First-Lien Facility contains a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among
other things, limit or restrict the ability of the Company and the Guarantors to (1) incur additional indebtedness
(including guarantee obligations); (2) incur liens; (3) engage in mergers or other fundamental changes; (4) sell
certain property or assets; (5) pay dividends or other distributions; (6) make acquisitions, investments, loans and
advances; (7) prepay certain indebtedness; (8) change the nature of their business; (9) engage in certain transactions
with affiliates; and (10) incur restrictions on contractual obligations limiting interactions between the Company and
its subsidiaries or limit actions in relation to the First-Lien Facility.

**_Events of Default_**

The First-Lien Facility contains customary events of default, subject to certain grace periods, thresholds
and materiality qualifiers, including with respect to nonpayment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts;
material inaccuracy of a representation or warranty when made; failure to perform or observe covenants; crossdefault to other indebtedness in an amount in excess of $50 million; bankruptcy and insolvency events; inability to
pay debts; monetary judgment defaults in an amount in excess of $50 million; actual or asserted invalidity or

**ABL Facility**

On July 31, 2015, the Company amended and restated its previously existing $175 million senior secured
revolving credit facility with SunTrust Bank as administrative agent and collateral agent. The amended and restated
senior secured revolving credit facility provided for revolving credit financings of up to $800 million, subject to
availability under the borrowing base thereunder.

On March 22, 2017, the Company entered into an amendment to extend the maturity date and increase the
revolving commitments under its previously existing $800 million senior secured revolving credit facility, resulting
in the amended and restated $900 million ABL Facility due March 22, 2022. On April 24, 2019, the Company
amended the ABL Facility to extend the maturity date to November 22, 2023. SunTrust Bank continues to serve as
the administrative agent and collateral agent. The borrowing base for the ABL Facility, which determines
availability under the facility, is based on a percentage of the value of certain of the assets comprising ABL
Collateral. The following is a summary description of certain terms of the ABL Facility.

We intend to draw on the ABL Facility in connection with our conditional redemption of the 2024 Secured
Notes, and the net proceeds of such borrowing and the Notes will be used to redeem all of the outstanding aggregate
principal amount of our 2024 Secured Notes and to pay related transaction premiums, fees and expenses. See “Use
of Proceeds.”

**_Maturity and Prepayments_**

As amended, revolving loans and swingline loans incurred under the ABL Facility will have a final
maturity of November 22, 2023.

**_Security and Guarantees_**

All obligations under the ABL Facility are guaranteed jointly and severally by the Company and all other
subsidiaries that guarantee the 2024 Secured Notes. All obligations under the ABL Facility, and the guarantees of
those obligations, are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors subject to certain
exceptions and permitted liens, including a first-priority security interest in such assets that constitute ABL
Collateral and a second-priority security interest in such assets that constitute Notes Collateral.

**_Interest_**

At the Company’s option, loans under the ABL Facility bear interest based on either the eurodollar rate or
base rate (a rate equal to the highest of an agreed benchmark rate commercially available, the federal funds effective

23


-----

rate plus 0.50% and the eurodollar rate plus 1.0%) plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin in
respect of the loans under ABL Facility is (x) 1.75%, 1.50% or 1.25% in the case of eurodollar rate loans (based on
a measure of availability under the ABL Facility) and (y) 0.75%, 0.50% or 0.25% in the case of base rate loans
(based on a measure of availability under the ABL Facility).

In addition, the Company pays customary commitment fees and letter of credit fees under the agreement
governing the ABL Facility. The commitment fees will vary based upon a measure of the Company’s utilization
under the ABL Facility.

**_Covenants and Other Matters_**

The ABL Facility contains a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other
things, limit or restrict the ability of the Company and the Guarantors to (1) incur additional indebtedness (including
guarantee obligations); (2) incur liens; (3) engage in mergers or other fundamental changes; (4) sell certain property
or assets; (5) pay dividends or other distributions; (6) make acquisitions, investments, loans and advances; (7)
prepay certain indebtedness; (8) change the nature of their business; (9) engage in certain transactions with affiliates;
and (10) incur restrictions on contractual obligations limiting interactions between the Company and its subsidiaries
or limit actions in relation to the ABL Facility.

The ABL Facility also contains a financial covenant requiring the satisfaction of a minimum fixed charge
coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00 in the event that the Company does not meet a minimum measure of availability under
the ABL Facility.

**_Events of Default_**

The ABL Facility contains customary events of default, subject to certain grace periods, thresholds and
materiality qualifiers, including with respect to nonpayment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts; material
inaccuracy of a representation or warranty when made; failure to perform or observe covenants; cross-default to
other indebtedness in an amount in excess of $50 million; bankruptcy and insolvency events; inability to pay debts;
monetary judgment defaults in an amount in excess of $50 million; actual or asserted invalidity or impairment of
any definitive loan documentation; and a change of control.

**Senior Secured Notes due 2024**

On August 22, 2016, the Company completed the sale of $750 million aggregate principal amount of its
2024 Secured Notes. Net proceeds from the offering of the 2024 Secured Notes were used to redeem all of the
Company’s outstanding 7.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2021, repay approximately $126 million of the
Company’s borrowings under its Original First-Lien Credit Agreement and pay related transaction fees and
expenses.

We intend to use the proceeds of the offering of the Notes, together with borrowing under our ABL
Facility, to redeem the 2024 Secured Notes and to pay related premiums, fees and expenses. See “Summary—
Recent Developments—Notice of Conditional Redemption.”

**Senior Secured Notes due 2027**

On May 30, 2019, the Company completed a private offering of $400.0 million in aggregate principal
amount of its 2027 Secured Notes. Net proceeds from the offering of the 2027 Secured Notes were used to repay a
portion of the funds drawn under the Company’s First-Lien Facility, to repurchase approximately $97 million
aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Secured Notes from certain beneficial owners in open market transactions
and to pay related transaction fees and expenses, with the remaining net proceeds being used for general corporate
purposes.

On July 25, 2019, the Company completed a private offering of an additional $75.0 million in aggregate
principal amount of the 2027 Secured Notes at an issue price of 104.5% of their par value. The net proceeds from

24


-----

this additional issuance of the 2027 Secured Notes were used to redeem an additional $75.0 million in aggregate
principal amount of the 2024 Secured Notes and to pay related transaction fees and expenses.

The 2027 Secured Notes were issued and sold in a private transaction exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act, to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the
Securities Act and to non-U.S. persons outside of the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities
Act. Accordingly, the 2027 Secured Notes and the related guarantees are not registered under the Securities Act and
the 2027 Secured Notes and the related guarantees may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration
or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The 2027 Secured Notes are the
Company’s senior secured obligations and are guaranteed on a senior basis by certain of its direct and indirect
wholly-owned subsidiaries.

**_Indenture_**

The terms of the 2027 Secured Notes are governed by the indenture dated as of May 30, 2019 (the “2027
Secured Notes Indenture”), among the Issuer, the guarantors named therein (the “2027 Secured Notes Guarantors”)
and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee and collateral agent.

**_Interest and Maturity_**

The 2027 Secured Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.750% and mature on June 1, 2027. Interest is payable on
the 2027 Secured Notes on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2019.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

The 2027 Secured Notes, subject to certain exceptions, are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior
secured basis, by the 2027 Secured Notes Guarantors. All obligations under the 2027 Secured Notes, and the
guarantees of those obligations, are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the 2027 Secured
Notes Guarantors subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, including a first-priority security interest in such
assets that constitute Notes Collateral and a second-priority security interest in such assets that constitute ABL
Collateral.

Intercreditor agreements govern all arrangements in respect of the priority of the security interests in the
ABL Collateral and the Notes Collateral among the parties to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the 2027 Secured
Notes Indenture and the indenture governing the 2024 Secured Notes.

**_Ranking_**

The 2027 Secured Notes constitute senior secured obligations of the Company and the 2027 Secured Notes
Guarantors, rank senior in right of payment to all future debt of the Company and the 2027 Secured Notes
Guarantors that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2027 Secured Notes, and rank equally in right of
payment with all existing and future liabilities of the Company and the 2027 Secured Notes Guarantors that are not
so subordinated, including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the 2024 Secured Notes.

**_Covenants_**

The 2027 Secured Notes Indenture contains restrictive covenants that limit the ability of the Company and
its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional debt or issue preferred stock; create liens; create
restrictions on the Company’s subsidiaries’ ability to make payments to the Company; pay dividends and make
other distributions in respect of the capital stock of the Company and the 2027 Secured Notes Guarantors; make
certain investments or certain other restricted payments; guarantee indebtedness; designate unrestricted subsidiaries;
sell certain kinds of assets; enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and effect mergers and
consolidations.

25


-----

Certain of these covenants will be suspended if the 2027 Secured Notes are assigned an investment grade
rating by any two of S&P, Moody’s or Fitch and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing.

**_Events of Default_**

The 2027 Secured Notes Indenture provides for events of default (subject in certain cases to customary
grace and cure periods), which include, among others, nonpayment of principal or interest when due, breach of
covenants or other agreements in the 2027 Secured Notes Indenture, defaults in payment of certain other
indebtedness and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Generally, if an event of default occurs, the Trustee or
the Holders of 30% in principal amount of the outstanding 2027 Secured Notes may declare the principal of and
unpaid interest on all of the 2027 Secured Notes to be due and payable immediately.

**_Redemption_**

At any time prior to June 1, 2022, the Company may redeem the 2027 Secured Notes in whole or in part at
a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2027 Secured Notes plus the “applicable premium”
set forth in the 2027 Secured Notes Indenture. At any time on or after June 1, 2022, the Company may redeem the
2027 Secured Notes at the redemption prices set forth in the 2027 Secured Notes Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time and from time to time prior to May 30, 2022, the
Company may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Secured Notes at a redemption price
of 103% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. In
addition, at any time prior to June 1, 2022, the Company may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount
of the 2027 Secured Notes with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings, as described in the 2027
Secured Notes Indenture, at a price equal to 106.750% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the redemption date. If the Company experiences certain change of control events, holders of the
2027 Secured Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or part of its 2027 Secured Notes at 101% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

The following is a description of the $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of % senior notes due
2030 (the “Notes”). The Notes will be issued by Builders FirstSource, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
“Company”). In this Description of the Notes, the term “Company” refers only to Builders FirstSource, Inc. and not
to any of its Subsidiaries.

The Company will issue the Notes under an indenture (the “Indenture”) to be dated as of the Issue Date,
among the Company, the Guarantors (as defined below) and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the
“Trustee”). The Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The Notes are subject to all such terms pursuant to the provisions of the
Indenture, and Holders of the Notes are referred to the Indenture for a statement thereof.

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture. Because this is a summary, it may not
contain all the information that is important to you. You should read the Indenture in its entirety. A copy of the
proposed form of the Indenture may be requested as described under “Where You Can Find Additional Information
And Incorporation By Reference.” You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under “—
Certain Definitions.” The capitalized terms defined in “—Certain Definitions” below are used in this “Description of
the Notes” as so defined.

The Company does not intend to list the Notes on any securities exchange. The Company will not be required
to, nor does the Company currently intend to, offer to exchange the Notes for notes registered under the Securities
Act or otherwise register or qualify by prospectus the Notes for resale under the Securities Act. The Indenture will
not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act or subject to the terms of the Trust Indenture Act. Accordingly, the
terms of the Notes include only those stated in the Indenture.

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Note Guarantees**

The Notes will be:

    - general senior unsecured obligations of the Company;

    - _pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future senior Indebtedness (including_
Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, the ABL and the Existing Notes) of the Company;

    - effectively subordinated to all Secured Indebtedness (including Indebtedness under the Credit
Agreement, the ABL and the Existing Notes) of the Company to the extent of the value of the assets
securing such Indebtedness;

    - senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company;

    - unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis, jointly and severally, by each Guarantor; and

    - structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities, including
preferred stock, of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries and any other Subsidiaries of the Company that are not
Guarantors.

Each Note Guarantee (as defined below) will be:

    - a general senior unsecured obligation of the applicable Guarantor;

    - _pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of that Guarantor,_
including its guarantee of the Credit Agreement, the ABL and the Existing Notes;

27


-----

    - effectively subordinated to all Secured Indebtedness (including guarantees of the Credit Agreement,
the ABL and the Existing Notes) of such Guarantor to the extent of the value of the assets securing
such Indebtedness;

    - senior in right of payment to all future Subordinated Indebtedness of that Guarantor; and

    - structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities, including
preferred stock, of any Subsidiaries of that Guarantor that are not Guarantors.

As of September 30, 2019, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had
approximately $1,420.6 million of total debt outstanding, including $500.0 million of the Notes offered hereby and
$920.6 million of total secured debt outstanding (consisting of $157.1 million of borrowings under the First-Lien
Facility, $47.0 million of borrowings under the ABL Facility, with $766.5 million of additional availability (subject
to availability under a borrowing base and after giving effect to $82.2 million of letters of credit outstanding as of
September 30, 2019) thereunder, $475.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the 2027 Secured
Notes and $241.5 million of other finance obligations and finance lease obligations).

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Company will issue Notes in minimum denominations of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in
excess thereof. The rights of Holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive the payments on such Notes are
subject to applicable procedures of DTC. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business
Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the
amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or
other payment as a result of any such delay.

The Company will issue an aggregate principal amount of $500,000,000 of Notes pursuant to the
Transactions. The Notes will mature on, 2030. Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate per annum set
forth on the cover of this Offering Circular and will be payable, in cash, semi-annually in arrears on and
of each year, commencing on, 2020, to Holders of record on the immediately preceding and
, respectively. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no
interest has been paid, from the Issue Date. If the Company delivers global notes to the Trustee for cancellation on a
date that is after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, then interest shall be paid
in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
comprised of twelve 30-day months. Each interest period will end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment
date.

**Additional Notes**

The Company may issue additional Notes (the “Additional Notes”) from time to time under the Indenture.
The Indenture will provide for the issuance of Additional Notes having identical terms and conditions to the Notes
offered hereby, subject to compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture. Additional Notes will be part of
the same issue as the Notes offered hereby under the Indenture for all purposes, including waivers, amendments,
redemptions and offers to purchase; provided that Additional Notes will not be issued with the same CUSIP as the
Notes offered hereby unless such Additional Notes are fungible with the Notes offered hereby for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

**Payments**

Principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be payable at the office or agency of the
Company maintained for such purpose (along with any other paying agent maintained by the Company, the “Paying
Agent”) or, at the option of the Paying Agent, payment of interest, if any, may be made by check mailed to the
Holders of the Notes at their respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders or by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holders of the Notes provided that all payments of

28


-----

principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to Notes represented by one or more global notes registered in
the name of or held by the DTC or its nominee will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
accounts specified by the Holders thereof. Until otherwise designated by the Company, the Company’s office or
agency maintained for such purpose will be the office of the Trustee.

**Guarantees**

The obligations of the Company under the Notes and the Indenture will be, jointly and severally,
unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis (the “Note Guarantees”) by each existing and future
Wholly-Owned Domestic Restricted Subsidiary (the “Guarantors”) that Guarantees the Company’s obligations
under the Credit Agreement. Following the Issue Date, Subsidiaries will be required to Guarantee the Notes to the
extent described in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees.”

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, those of our subsidiaries that will not serve as Guarantors
accounted for a de minimis percentage of our sales, total assets and total liabilities.

Each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Note Guarantor’s
obligations subject to avoidance under applicable law as a fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or unjust
preference, including provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or
state law or provincial law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this
limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with
respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. See “Risk
Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific
circumstances, to void Notes and require note holders to return payments received.”

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon:

(1) a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of the Capital Stock of such Guarantor or the sale,
exchange, transfer or other disposition, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Guarantor to a
Person other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and as otherwise permitted by the
Indenture;

(2) the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or the
occurrence of any event after which the Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary;

(3) defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and
Discharge”;

(4) to the extent that such Guarantor is not an Immaterial Subsidiary solely due to the operation of clause
(i) of the definition of “Immaterial Subsidiary,” upon the release of the guarantee referred to in such
clause;

(5) such Guarantor being (or being substantially concurrently) released or discharged from all of (i) its
obligations under all of its Guarantees of payment by the Company of any Indebtedness of the
Company under the Credit Agreement or (ii) in the case of a Note Guarantee made by a Guarantor
(each, an “Other Guarantee”) as a result of its guarantee of other Indebtedness of the Company or a
Guarantor pursuant to the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees,” the
relevant Indebtedness, except in the case of (i) or (ii), a release as a result of payment under such
Guarantee (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still considered a
release, and if any such Guarantee of such Guarantor under the Credit Agreement or any Other
Guarantee is so reinstated, such Note Guarantee shall also be reinstated);

29


-----

(6) upon the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Guarantor with and into the Company or
another Guarantor or upon the liquidation of such Guarantor, in each case, in compliance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(7) upon the achievement of Investment Grade Status by the Notes; provided that such Note Guarantee
shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date; and

(8) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers.”

Claims of creditors of Non-Guarantors, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt
and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those
Subsidiaries and claims against joint ventures generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of
those Subsidiaries and joint ventures over the claims of creditors of the Company, including Holders of the Notes.
The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefor will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors)
and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Company (other than the Guarantors) and
joint ventures. Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock
of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions.

Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of
liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—
Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below, the Notes are not redeemable at the option of the Company.

At any time prior to, 2025, the Company may redeem the Notes in whole or in part, at its option,
upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of such Notes plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding,
the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time on or after, 2025, the Company may redeem the Notes in whole
or in part upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to the percentage of
principal amount set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes redeemed, to, but excluding,
the applicable date of redemption, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on of the year

At any time and from time to time prior to, 2023, the Company may redeem Notes with the net
cash proceeds received by the Company from any Equity Offering at a redemption price equal to % plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, in an aggregate principal amount for all
such redemptions not to exceed 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including Additional
Notes); provided that

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related Equity
Offering, and

30


-----

(2) not less than 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued under the Indenture
remains outstanding immediately thereafter (excluding Notes held by the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries), unless all such Notes are redeemed substantially concurrently.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, including a Change of
Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Company, or any third
party making a such tender offer in lieu of the Company, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn by such Holders, the Company or such third party will have the right upon not less than 15 nor more than
60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 15 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes that remain
outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price equal to the price offered to each other Holder (excluding
any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment,
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such redemption.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

Notice of any redemption of the Notes may, at the Company’s discretion, be given prior to the completion of
a corporate transaction (including an Equity Offering, an incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of Control or other
corporate transaction) and any redemption notice may, at the Company’s discretion, be subject to one or more
conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a related transaction. If such redemption or
purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such
condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Company’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until
such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption was mailed or delivered, including by
electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption or purchase may not
occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by
the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed. In addition, the Company may provide in such notice
that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Company’s obligations with respect to such
redemption may be performed by another Person.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to the redemption date will be paid to the Person in whose name
the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to
Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Company.

Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund**

The Company is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to offer to purchase
Notes as described under the captions “—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of
Assets and Subsidiary Stock.” The Company may at any time and from time to time purchase our outstanding debt
securities or loans, including the Notes, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or
otherwise.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select the Notes for redemption in
compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed, as
certified to the Trustee by the Company, and in compliance with the requirements of DTC, or if the Notes are not so
listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Notes are not held through DTC or DTC
prescribes no method of selection, the Trustee will select on a pro rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Note

31


-----

in an unauthorized denomination remains outstanding after such redemption; provided, however, that no Note of
$2,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least 15 days but not
more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at the address of such Holder
appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, except that
redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the
notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the
portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Note will be issued in
the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a global note, an appropriate
notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed
portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained
therein), Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption
date, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or
portions of them called for redemption.

**Change of Control**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless the Company has previously or
substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as
described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Company will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to
the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate
principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase, subject to
the right of Holders of the Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company will deliver or cause to be delivered
notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the procedures of DTC or by first-class
mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security
register, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase
the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30
days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the
Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance
of a Change of Control as described below.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities
laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue
thereof. The Company may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will
not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that
permit the Holders of the Notes to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a
takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the
Credit Agreement and the ABL that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder and
would also likely require the Company to offer to repurchase the Existing Notes. Future Indebtedness of the
Company or its subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control
or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of
their right to require the Company to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if
the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company. There can be
no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases.

32


-----

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be
limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to
make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances
make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The
Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Notes and us. We
have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control after the Issue Date, although it is
possible that we could decide to do so in the future.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including
acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the
Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our
capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the
covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants,
however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection
in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a
third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases
all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of
all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional
Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption
date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable
redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may
be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable
law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a
Holder of Notes may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

A sale, lease or other disposition by the Company of any part of its assets shall not be deemed to constitute
the sale, lease or other disposition of substantially all of its assets for purposes of the Indenture if the fair market
value of the assets retained by the Company exceeds 100% of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding
Notes and any other outstanding Indebtedness of the Company that ranks equally with, or senior to, the Notes with
respect to such assets. This paragraph is not intended to limit the Company’s sales, leases or other dispositions of
less than substantially all of its assets.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

Following the first day:

33


-----

(a) the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture,

then, beginning on that day and continuing until the Reversion Date (as defined below), the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following headings
(collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

    - “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

    - “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

    - “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

    - “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

    - “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

    - “—Limitation on Guarantees”; and

    - the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Amalgamation and Consolidation.”

If at any time the Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status, then the Suspended Covenants will
thereafter be reinstated as if such covenants had never been suspended (the “Reversion Date”) and be applicable
pursuant to the terms of the Indenture (including in connection with performing any calculation or assessment to
determine compliance with the terms of the Indenture), unless and until the Notes subsequently attain Investment
Grade Status and no Default or Event of Default is in existence (in which event the Suspended Covenants shall no
longer be in effect for such time that the Notes maintain an Investment Grade Status); provided, however, that no
Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Note
Guarantees with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on, and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall bear any liability for, any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period (as defined below), or
any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising prior to the Reversion Date, regardless of
whether such actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in effect
during such period. The period of time between the date of suspension of the covenants and the Reversion Date is
referred to as the “Suspension Period.”

On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been
outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of “—
Limitation on Indebtedness.” On and after the Reversion Date, all Liens created during the Suspension Period will
be considered Permitted Liens. Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as
Restricted Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be made as though the covenants described
under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect since the Issue Date and prior to, but not during, the
Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the
amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Restricted
Payments.” On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Any Affiliate Transaction
entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period will be
deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (6) of the
second paragraph under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.” Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of
any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of “—
Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during the
Suspension Period will be deemed to have existed on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause
(1) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.” In
addition, any future obligation to grant further Guarantees shall be released. All such further obligation to grant
Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date. No Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have

34


-----

occurred on the Reversion Date as a result of any actions taken by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries during
the Suspension Period.

On and after each Reversion Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the
transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such contract and
such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status.

The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes, shall not be deemed to have any
knowledge of the ratings of the Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Notes achieve Investment
Grade Status or of the occurrence of a Reversion Date.

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Company and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may
Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma
effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries is greater than 2.00 to 1.00; provided, further, that Non-Guarantors may not
Incur Indebtedness under this paragraph if, after giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence (including a pro forma
application of the net proceeds therefrom), more than an aggregate of the greater of (a) $375.0 million and (b) 75%
of LTM EBITDA of Indebtedness of Non-Guarantors would be outstanding pursuant to this paragraph at such time.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness
(collectively, “Permitted Debt”):

(1) (X) Indebtedness Incurred under any Credit Facility (other than the ABL) by the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (including letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or created under any
Credit Facility) and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness, up to an aggregate principal amount
equal to the sum of (I) the greater of (a) $600.0 million and (b) the maximum amount of Indebtedness that
the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries could incur such that the Consolidated Secured Leverage
Ratio is equal to or less than 4.00 to 1.00 on a pro forma basis (provided that, for the purposes of
determining the amount that may be Incurred under this clause (I)(b), all Indebtedness incurred under
this clause (I)(b) shall be deemed to be secured by Liens) plus (II) the greater of $375.0 million and
75% of LTM EBITDA, in each case, outstanding at any one time, (Y) Indebtedness Incurred under the
ABL by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (including letters of credit or bankers’
acceptances issued or created under any Credit Facility) and Guarantees in respect of such
Indebtedness, up to an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time not to exceed the
greater of (a) $1,300.0 million and (b) the Borrowing Base as of the date of such incurrence, and (Z) in
the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause or any portion thereof, the
aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, premiums (including,
without limitation, tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing, and
any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof;

(2) Guarantees by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other obligations of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness or other
obligation is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Company owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided,
_however, that:_

35


-----

(a) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any such
Indebtedness being held by a Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary; and

(b) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary,

shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Company or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) Indebtedness represented by (a) the Notes (other than any Additional Notes), including any Guarantee
thereof, (b) any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clauses (1), (2) and (4)(a)
above) outstanding on the Issue Date (including the Existing Notes) and any Guarantee thereof, (c)
Refinancing Indebtedness (including, with respect to the Notes and the Existing Notes, any Guarantee
thereof) Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in this clause or clause (2), (5) or (8) of this
paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, and (d) Management Advances;

(5) Indebtedness of (x) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurred or issued to finance an
acquisition or Investment or (y) Persons that are acquired by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary or merged into, amalgamated or consolidated with the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary
in accordance with the terms of the Indenture (including designating an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a
Restricted Subsidiary); provided that such Indebtedness is in an aggregate amount not to exceed (i) the
greater of $125.0 million and 25% of LTM EBITDA at any time outstanding plus (ii) unlimited
additional Indebtedness if after giving pro forma effect to such acquisition, merger, amalgamation or
consolidation, either

(a) the Company would be permitted to Incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the
first paragraph of this covenant,

(b) either the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries would not
be lower or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries would not be higher, in each case, than immediately prior to such acquisition, merger,
amalgamation or consolidation, or

(c) such Indebtedness constitutes Acquired Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness Incurred in
contemplation of the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person
became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary); provided that the only obligors with respect to such Indebtedness shall be those
Persons who were obligors of such Indebtedness prior to such acquisition, merger, amalgamation
or consolidation;

(6) Hedging Obligations (excluding Hedging Obligations entered into for speculative purposes);

(7) Indebtedness (i) represented by Finance Lease Obligations or Purchase Money Obligations in an
aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all
other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause and then outstanding, does not exceed the greater
of (a) $125.0 million and (b) 25% of LTM EBITDA (for the avoidance of doubt, Unsecured Finance
Leases shall be permitted in an unlimited amount pursuant to clause (22)), and any Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof and (ii) arising out of Sale and Leaseback Transactions;

(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, health, disability or other employee

or obligations and completion guarantees and warranties provided by the Company or a Restricted

36


-----

Subsidiary or relating to liabilities, obligations or guarantees Incurred in the ordinary course of
business or consistent with past practice; (b) the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a
check, draft or similar instrument drawn against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business or
consistent with past practice; provided, however, that such Indebtedness is extinguished within five
Business Days of Incurrence; (c) customer deposits and advance payments received in the ordinary
course of business or consistent with past practice from customers for goods or services purchased in
the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice; (d) letters of credit, bankers’
acceptances, discounted bills of exchange, discounting or factoring of receivables or payables for
credit management purposes, warehouse receipts, guarantees or other similar instruments or
obligations issued or entered into, or relating to liabilities or obligations Incurred in the ordinary course
of business or consistent with past practice; (e) any customary treasury, depositary, cash management,
automatic clearinghouse arrangements, overdraft protections, credit or debit card, purchase card,
electronic funds transfer, cash pooling or netting or setting off arrangements or similar arrangements in

(9) Indebtedness arising from agreements providing for guarantees, indemnification, obligations in respect
of earn-outs, deferred purchase price or other adjustments of purchase price or, in each case, similar
obligations, in each case, Incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition or disposition of any
business or assets or Person or any Capital Stock of a Subsidiary (other than Guarantees of
Indebtedness Incurred by any Person acquiring or disposing of such business or assets or such
Subsidiary for the purpose of financing such acquisition or disposition); provided that the maximum
liability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of all such Indebtedness in
connection with a disposition shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds, including the fair market
value of non-cash proceeds (measured at the time received and without giving effect to any subsequent
changes in value), actually received by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with
such disposition;

(10) Indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the
principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause and then outstanding, will

than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of its Capital Stock or otherwise contributed to the equity (in each
case, other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock, Designated Preferred Stock or an Excluded
Contribution) of the Company, in each case, subsequent to the Issue Date and any Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof; provided, however, that (i) any such Net Cash Proceeds that are so
received or contributed shall not increase the amount available for making Restricted Payments to the
extent the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries Incur Indebtedness in reliance thereon and (ii) any
Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of Incurring
Indebtedness pursuant to this clause to the extent such Net Cash Proceeds or cash have been applied to
make Restricted Payments;

Entity that is permitted by the covenant described below under “—Limitation on Restricted
Payments”;

(13) Indebtedness of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries consisting of (i) the financing of

portion of the amounts payable by such customers to the Person extending such credit;

(19) Indebtedness to a customer to finance the acquisition of any equipment necessary to perform services
for such customer; provided that the terms of such Indebtedness are consistent with those entered into
with respect to similar Indebtedness prior to the Issue Date, including that (1) the repayment of such
Indebtedness is conditional upon such customer ordering a specific volume of goods and (2) such
Indebtedness does not bear interest or provide for scheduled amortization or maturity;

(20) Indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the
principal amount of all other Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause and then outstanding, will
not exceed the Available RP Capacity Amount;

(21) obligations in respect of Disqualified Stock in an amount not to exceed the greater of $50.0 million and
10% of LTM EBITDA outstanding at any time;

(22) Unsecured Finance Leases; and

(23) Indebtedness incurred by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to the extent that the net
proceeds thereof are promptly deposited with the Trustee to satisfy or discharge the Notes or exercise
the Company’s legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, in each case, in accordance with the
Indenture.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) subject to clause (3) below, in the event that all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness meets the
criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of
this covenant, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify,
such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in
the first paragraph above or one of the clauses of the second paragraph of this covenant;

(2) additionally, all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness may later be reclassified as having been
Incurred pursuant to any type of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this
covenant so long as such Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred pursuant to such provision and any
related Liens are permitted to be Incurred at the time of reclassification (it being understood that any
Indebtedness incurred pursuant to one of the clauses of the second paragraph of this covenant shall

38


-----

cease to be deemed incurred or outstanding for purposes of such clause but shall be deemed incurred
for the purposes of the first paragraph of this covenant from and after the first date on which the
Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries could have incurred such Indebtedness under the first
paragraph of this covenant without reliance on such clause);

(3) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the Credit Agreement and the ABL shall be
deemed to have been Incurred on the Issue Date under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the
description of this covenant;

(4) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, such Indebtedness shall not include the aggregate amount
of fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including, without
limitation, tender premiums), defeasance costs, fees and other costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such
refinancing;

(5) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination
of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(6) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as incurred pursuant to any clause of the
second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or
other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be
included;

(7) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or
repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the
liquidation preference thereof;

(8) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or
more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(9) in the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a
revolving credit facility, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio
or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as applicable, for borrowings and reborrowings thereunder
(and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at
the Company’s option as elected on the date the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may
be, enters into or increases such commitments, either (a) be determined on the date of such revolving
credit facility or such increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof has been
borrowed as of such date), and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured
Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test is satisfied with respect
thereto at such time, any borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters
of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total
Leverage Ratio, as applicable, at the time of any borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of
letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be borrowed
or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date
pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such
date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio or the
Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as applicable) or (b) be determined on the date such amount is
borrowed pursuant to any such facility or increased commitment;

39


-----

(10) in the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (x) incurs Indebtedness to finance an
acquisition or (y) assumes Indebtedness of Persons that are acquired by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary or merged into the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture, the date of determination of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured
Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall, at the option of the
Company, be the date that a definitive agreement for such acquisition is entered into and the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Leverage
Ratio, as applicable, shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such acquisition and the other
transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and
the use of proceeds thereof) consistent with the definition of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and, for
the avoidance of doubt, (A) if any such ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such ratio
(including due to fluctuations in the EBITDA of the Company or the target company) at or prior to the
consummation of the relevant acquisition, such ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a
result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether such acquisition and any related
transactions are permitted hereunder and (B) such ratios shall not be tested at the time of
consummation of such acquisition or related transactions; provided, further, that if the Company elects
to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, (i) any such
transaction shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreement is entered into and to
be outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any ratios under the Indenture after the date of
such agreement and before the earlier of the date of consummation of such acquisition or the date such
agreement is terminated or expires without consummation of such acquisition and (ii) to the extent any
covenant baskets were utilized in satisfying any covenants, such baskets shall be deemed utilized until
the earlier of the date of consummation of such acquisition or the date such agreement is terminated or
expires without consummation of such acquisition, but any calculation of Consolidated EBITDA for
purposes of other incurrences of Indebtedness or Liens or making of Restricted Payments (not related
to such acquisition) shall not reflect such acquisition until it has been consummated;

(11) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness incurred to
refinance Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this
covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such
refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based
on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA
restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing
Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs,
underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or
similar fees) in connection with such refinancing; and

(12) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal
to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of GAAP.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in
the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or
obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of
Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation
on Indebtedness,” the Company shall be in default of this covenant).

40


-----

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of
Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall
be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in
the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided, that if such Indebtedness is
Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the
applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been
exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (a) the principal amount
of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (b) the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest, dividends,
premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses
(including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely
as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be
calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness
is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

The Indenture will provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, directly or
indirectly, incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that is subordinated or junior in right of
payment to any Indebtedness of the Company or such Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such Indebtedness is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee to the extent and in the
same manner as such Indebtedness is subordinated to other Indebtedness of the Company or such Guarantor, as the
case may be.

The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness
merely because it is unsecured or (2) senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other senior Indebtedness
merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or is secured by different collateral or
because it is guaranteed by different obligors.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

Restricted Payments made pursuant to the next succeeding paragraph) would exceed the sum (the
“Available Amount”) of (without duplication):

(ii) 50% of Consolidated Net Income for the period (treated as one accounting period) from July 1,

otherwise contributed to the equity (other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock or
Designated Preferred Stock) of the Company subsequent to the 2024 Notes Issue Date (other
than (x) Net Cash Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities received from an

merger, amalgamation or consolidation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary into the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary or the transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary after the 2024 Notes Issue Date, the fair
market value of the Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary (or the assets transferred), as
determined in good faith by the Company, at the time of the redesignation of such Unrestricted

with the Unrestricted Subsidiary so designated or merged, amalgamated or consolidated or
Indebtedness associated with the assets so transferred), other than to the extent of the amount
of the Investment that constituted a Permitted Investment or was made under clause (16) of the

the case may be.

As of September 30, 2019, the amount available pursuant to clause (c)(ii) above was approximately $278.1
million.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit any of the following (collectively, “Permitted Payments”):

(1) the payment of any dividend or distribution within 60 days after the date of declaration thereof, if at
the date of declaration such payment would have complied with the provisions of the Indenture or the

payment would have complied with the provisions of the Indenture as if it were and is deemed at such
time to be a Restricted Payment at the time of such notice;

the Company (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preferred Stock) (“Refunding Capital
_Stock”) or a substantially concurrent contribution to the equity (other than through the issuance of_
Disqualified Stock or Designated Preferred Stock or through an Excluded Contribution) of the

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (a) in the event that a Restricted Payment or
Investment (or portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments
described in clauses (1) through (18) above, or is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or
one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,” the Company will be entitled to
divide or classify such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later
divide, classify or reclassify in whole or in part in its sole discretion (based on circumstances existing on the date of
such division, classification or reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in any
manner that complies with this covenant, including as an Investment pursuant to one or more of the clauses

46


-----

contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments” and (b) any amount permitted by this covenant shall be
reduced by any corresponding amount of Indebtedness outstanding that was incurred pursuant to clause (20) of the
second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such
Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any cash
Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment, property
or assets other than cash shall be determined conclusively by the Company acting in good faith.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or
suffer to exist any Lien (except Permitted Liens) (each, a “Subject Lien”) that secures Obligations under any
Indebtedness on any asset or property of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, unless the Notes and the
Guarantees are equally and ratably secured with (or on a senior basis to, in the case such Subject Lien secures any
Subordinated Indebtedness) the Obligations secured by such Subject Lien.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes pursuant to the preceding paragraph may provide
by its terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and
discharge of the Subject Lien that gave rise to the obligation to so secure the Notes and the Guarantees.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of
the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of
original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a
result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit
to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such
an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility, (b) the Existing Notes, including
any Guarantee thereof, or (c) any other agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered
into on the Issue Date;

47

Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person was
acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or
instrument is assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition
of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any
portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to
which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Company or was merged,
consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or entered
into in contemplation of or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date;
_provided that, for the purposes of this clause, if another Person is the Successor Company, any_
Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed
acquired or assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the
Successor Company;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset
that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract or agreement, or the assignment or transfer of
any lease, license or other contract or agreement;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under the
Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the
Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer or encumbrance of
the property or assets subject to such mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any
reciprocal easement agreements of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Finance Lease
Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on
the property so acquired;

sale or disposition to a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are subject to such restriction) pending the
closing of such sale or disposition;

similar agreements, organizational documents and instruments;

(9) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable rule,
regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

thereto or their Subsidiaries;

(13) restrictions created in connection with any Receivables Facility that, in the good faith determination of
the Company, are necessary or advisable to effect such Receivables Facility;

(14) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any
Indebtedness, shall only be permitted if such Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the
Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”

are not materially less favorable to the Holders than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in
the Credit Agreement and the Existing Notes Indentures, together with the security documents
associated therewith, or the Indenture as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) in comparable financings (as
determined in good faith by the Company) and where, in the case of clause (ii), either (a) the Company
determines at the time of entry into such agreement or instrument that such encumbrances or
restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Company’s ability to make principal
or interest payments on the Notes or (b) such encumbrance or restriction applies only during the
continuance of a default relating to such agreement or instrument;

Liens”; or

(16) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to
in clauses (1) to (15) of this paragraph or this clause (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any
amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clauses (1) to (15) of this
paragraph or this clause (16); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to
such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any
material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in
the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or
other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Company).

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition
unless:

(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by
way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or
otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date
of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Company, of
the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such
Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset Disposition,
together with all other Asset Dispositions since the Issue Date (on a cumulative basis) (including by
way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or
otherwise), received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form
of cash or Cash Equivalents; and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied:

(a) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is required
by the terms of any Indebtedness), (i) to prepay, repay or purchase any Indebtedness of a Non
49


-----

Guarantor (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary) or any Secured Indebtedness, including Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, the
Existing Notes or ABL (or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) within 450 days from
the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash;
_provided, however, that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of_
Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (i), the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire
such Indebtedness and, other than any such Indebtedness under the ABL (or any Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof), will cause the related commitment (if any) to be reduced in an
amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased; or (ii) to prepay, repay or
purchase Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided further that, to the extent the Company redeems,
repays or repurchases such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (ii), the Company shall equally
and ratably reduce Obligations under the Notes as provided under “— Optional Redemption,”
through open-market purchases (to the extent such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal
amount thereof) or by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an
Asset Disposition Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes at 100% of the principal amount
thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on the amount of Notes that would
otherwise be prepaid; and

(b) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to invest in
Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted
Subsidiary equal to the amount of Net Available Cash received by the Company or another
Restricted Subsidiary) within 450 days from the later of (after giving effect to any Acceptable
Commitment or Second Commitment (each as defined below), the “Application Period”) (i) the
date of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however,
that a binding agreement shall be treated as a permitted application of Net Available Cash from the
date of such commitment with the good faith expectation that an amount equal to Net Available
Cash will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an
“Acceptable Commitment”) and, in the event of any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or
terminated for any reason before such amount is applied in connection therewith, the Company or
such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a “Second Commitment”)
within 180 days of such cancellation or termination; provided further that if any Second
Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such amount is applied, then
such Net Available Cash shall constitute Excess Proceeds;

_provided that, pending the final application of the amount of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clause_
(a) or clause (b) above, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or
otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture; provided further that if at any
time during the Application Period the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to 4.00 to 1.00, the
Net Available Cash shall be deemed to have been applied in accordance with this covenant and the amount of
Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

The amount of any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed
to be applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds”
under the Indenture. On the 451st day after the later of an Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available
Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the Indenture exceeds the greater of $125.0 million and
25% of LTM EBITDA, the Company will within 10 Business Days be required to make an offer (“Asset Disposition
_Offer”) to all Holders of Notes issued under the Indenture and, to the extent the Company elects, to all holders of_
other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Pari
Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds,
at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and such
Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of
purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing such Pari Passu
Indebtedness, as applicable, and, with respect to the Notes, in minimum denominations of $2,000 and in integral
multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Company will deliver notice of such Asset Disposition Offer

50


-----

electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and each Holder of Notes at the
address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures
of DTC, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Asset Disposition and offering to repurchase
the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 15
days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the
Indenture and described in such notice. The Company may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net
Available Cash from an Asset Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to all Net Available
Cash prior to the expiration of the relevant 450 days (or such longer period provided above) or with respect to any
unapplied Excess Proceeds.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company may use
any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of
the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by
holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Company shall allocate the Excess
Proceeds among the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the
aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness provided that no Notes or other such
Pari Passu Indebtedness will be selected and purchased in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any
Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Additionally, the Company may, at its
option, make an Asset Disposition Offer using proceeds from any Asset Disposition at any time after the
consummation of such Asset Disposition. Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Disposition Offer, any
remaining Net Available Cash shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Company may use such Net Available
Cash for any purpose not prohibited by the Indenture.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a
currency other than U.S. dollars, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes shall not exceed the net amount
of funds in U.S. dollars that is actually received by the Company upon converting such portion into U.S. dollars.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Net Available
Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Foreign Subsidiary (a “Foreign Disposition”) is (x) prohibited or delayed by
applicable local law, (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents or any agreement or (z) subject to other
onerous organizational or administrative impediments from being repatriated to the United States, the portion of
such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such
amounts may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary so long, but only so long, as the applicable local law
documents or agreements will not permit repatriation to the United States (the Company hereby agreeing to use
reasonable efforts (as determined in the Company’s reasonable business judgment) to otherwise cause the applicable
Foreign Subsidiary to within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have
been required, promptly take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law, applicable organizational
impediments or other impediment to permit such repatriation), and if within one year following the date on which
the respective payment would otherwise have been required such repatriation of any of such affected Net Available
Cash is permitted under the applicable local law, applicable organizational impediment or other impediment, such
repatriation will be promptly effected and such repatriated Net Available Cash will be promptly (and in any event
not later than five (5) Business Days after such repatriation could be made) applied (net of additional Taxes payable
or reserved against as a result thereof) (whether or not such repatriation actually occurs) in compliance with this
covenant and (ii) to the extent that the Company has determined in good faith that repatriation of any of or all the
Net Available Cash of any Foreign Disposition would have an adverse Tax consequence (which for the avoidance of
doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any prepayment whereby doing so the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary, or
any of their respective affiliates and/or equity owners would incur a tax liability, including a tax dividend, deemed
dividend pursuant to Code Section 956 or a withholding tax, the Net Available Cash so affected may be retained by
the applicable Foreign Subsidiary. The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the
foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash:

51


-----

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or a
Guarantor) and the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such
Indebtedness or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into
cash or Cash Equivalents, or by their terms are required to be satisfied for cash and Cash Equivalents
(to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received), in each case, within 180 days following the
closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such
Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released
from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company (other than Subordinated Indebtedness)
received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in
such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding,
not to exceed the greater of $135.0 million and 4.0% of Total Assets (with the fair market value of
each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without
giving effect to subsequent changes in value).

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities
laws, rules and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by
virtue thereof.

The provisions of the Indenture relative to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes
as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority
in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes.

The Credit Agreement, the Existing Notes and ABL may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or
other agreements to which the Company becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Company from purchasing any
Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Company is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Company
could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that
contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain
prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Company’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would
constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to enter into or conduct any transaction
(including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of
the Company (an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of $30.0 million and 6%
of LTM EBITDA, unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a
comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for
such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

52


-----

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of $75.0
million and 15% of LTM EBITDA, the terms of such transaction have been approved by a majority of
the members of the Board of Directors.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (2) of this
paragraph if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors, if any.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment or other transaction permitted to be made or undertaken pursuant to the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” (including Permitted Payments) or
any Permitted Investment;

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or other
payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering
into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation
arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Company, any
Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Entity, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock
appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans
(including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or
similar plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees,
directors or consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the Company, in each case in the
ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) (a) any transaction between or among the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted
Subsidiaries and (b) any merger, amalgamation or consolidation with any Parent Entity, provided that
such Parent Entity shall have no material liabilities and no material assets other than cash, Cash
Equivalents and the Capital Stock of the Company and such merger, amalgamation or consolidation is
otherwise consummated in compliance with the Indenture;

(5) the payment of compensation, fees, costs and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary
indemnities (including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension
expenses provided on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or employees (or their respective
Controlled Investment Affiliates or Immediate Family Members) of the Company, any Parent Entity or
any Restricted Subsidiary (whether directly or indirectly and including through any Controlled
Investment Affiliate or Immediate Family Member of such directors, officers or employees);

(6) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of
funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date, as these agreements and
instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed or refinanced from time to
time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to
the Holders in any material respect;

(7) sales of accounts receivable, or participations therein, in connection with any Receivables Facility;

(8) transactions with customers, vendors, clients, joint venture partners, suppliers, contractors, distributors
or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary course of business or
consistent with past practice, which are fair to the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the
reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or the senior management of the Company or the

53


-----

relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably have
been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction between or among the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Person that is an
Affiliate of the Company or an Associate or similar entity solely because the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted
Holder owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(10) issuances, transfers or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preferred
Stock) of the Company or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock and the
granting of registration and other customary rights (and the performance of the related obligations) in
connection therewith or any contribution to capital of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(11) (a) payments by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly
or indirectly) of annual management, consulting, monitoring, refinancing, subsequent transaction exit
fees, advisory fees and related costs and expenses and indemnitees in connection therewith in an
aggregate amount not to exceed 2.5% of LTM EBITDA and (b) customary payments by the Company
or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including through
any Parent Entity) for financial advisory, financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect of
other investment banking activities, including in connection with acquisitions or divestitures, which
payments are approved by a majority of the Board of Directors in good faith;

(12) payment to any Permitted Holder of all out of pocket expenses Incurred by such Permitted Holder in
connection with its direct or indirect investment in the Company and its Subsidiaries;

(13) the Transactions and the payment of all fees, costs and expenses (including all legal, accounting and
other professional fees, costs and expenses) related to the Transactions, in each case as disclosed in this
Offering Circular;

(14) transactions in which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, delivers to the
Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the requirements of
clause (1) of the preceding paragraph;

(15) the existence of, or the performance by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiaries of its obligations
under the terms of, any equityholders, investor rights or similar agreement (including any registration

any similar agreement that it may enter into thereafter; provided, however, that the existence of, or the
performance by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of its obligations under any future
amendment to the equityholders’ agreement or under any similar agreement entered into after the Issue
Date will only be permitted under this clause to the extent that the terms of any such amendment or
new agreement are not otherwise disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect;

(16) any purchase by the Company’s Affiliates of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of the Company or
any of their Restricted Subsidiaries the majority of which Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock is
purchased by Persons who are not the Company’s Affiliates; provided that such purchases by the
Company’s Affiliates are on the same terms as such purchases by such Persons who are not the
Company’s Affiliates;

(17) (i) investments by Affiliates in securities or loans of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
(and payment of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Affiliates in connection
therewith) so long as the investment is being offered by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary
generally to other non-affiliated third party investors on the same or more favorable terms and (ii)
payments to Affiliates in respect of securities or loans of the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries contemplated in the foregoing subclause (i) or that were acquired from Persons other than

54


-----

the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case, in accordance with the terms of such
securities or loans;

(18) payments by the Company (and any Parent Entity) and its Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to any tax

the ownership or operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries;

(19) payments, Indebtedness and Disqualified Stock (and cancellation of any thereof) of the Company and

respective Controlled Investment Affiliates or Immediate Family Members) of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its direct or indirect parent companies pursuant to any management equity plan
or stock option plan or any other management or employee benefit plan or agreement or any stock
subscription or shareholder agreement; and any employment agreements, stock option plans and other
compensatory arrangements (and any successor plans thereto) and any supplemental executive

(20) employment and severance arrangements between the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries and their

the Company or otherwise on customary terms for such type of arrangements in connection with
similar transactions;

(22) transactions entered into by an Unrestricted Subsidiary with an Affiliate prior to the day such
Unrestricted Subsidiary is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary as described under the caption “—
Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries”; and

(23) any Permitted Tax Restructuring.

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation
would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate fair
market value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary
designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation
and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the covenant described above under the caption
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or under one or more clauses of the definition of
Permitted Investments, as determined by the Company. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment
would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary. The Company may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if that
redesignation would not cause a Default.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Company as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the
Trustee by an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the preceding conditions and was
permitted by the covenant described above under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted
Payments.” If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and
any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as of

55


-----

such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under the covenant described
under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Company will be in default of such
covenant.

The Company may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation
will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under the caption “—
Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” (including pursuant to clause 5(b) of the second paragraph thereof
treating such redesignation as an acquisition for the purpose of such clause) calculated on a pro forma basis as if
such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of
Default would be in existence following such designation. Any such designation by the Company shall be evidenced
to the Trustee by an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the preceding conditions.

**_Reports_**

Notwithstanding that the Company may not be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act or otherwise report on an annual and quarterly basis on forms provided for such annual and
quarterly reporting pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, from and after the Issue Date, the
Company will furnish to the Trustee:

(1) within 100 days after the end of each fiscal year (or if such day is not a Business Day, on the next
succeeding Business Day), all financial information that would be required to be contained in an
annual report on Form 10-K, or any successor or comparable form, filed with the SEC, including a
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and a
report on the annual financial statements by the Company’s independent registered public accounting
firm;

(2) within 55 days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year (or if such day is
not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day), all financial information that would be
required to be contained in a quarterly report on Form 10-Q, or any successor or comparable form,
filed with the SEC, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations,” and (B) financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP; and

(3) within 15 days after the occurrence of any of the following events, all current reports that would be
required to be filed with the SEC on Form 8-K or any successor or comparable form (if the Company
had been a reporting company under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act); provided, that the foregoing
shall not obligate the Company to make available (i) any information otherwise required to be included
on a Form 8-K regarding the occurrence of any such events if the Company determines in its good
faith judgment that such event that would otherwise be required to be disclosed is not material to the
Holders of the Notes or the business, assets, operations, financial positions or prospects of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (ii) a summary of the terms of, any
employment or compensatory arrangement, agreement, plan or understanding between the Company
(or any of its Subsidiaries) and any director, manager or executive officer of the Company (or any of
its Subsidiaries) or (iii) copies of any agreements, financial statements or other items that would be
required to be filed as exhibits to a current report on Form 8-K (except for (x) material Indebtedness
and (y) historical and pro forma financial statements to the extent reasonably available):

(a) the entry into or termination of material agreements;

(b) significant acquisitions or dispositions;

(c) bankruptcy;

56


-----

(d) cross-default under direct material financial obligations;

(e) a change in the Company’s certifying independent auditor;

(f) the appointment or departure of directors or executive officers;

(g) non-reliance on previously issued financial statements; and

(h) change of control transactions,

in each case, in a manner that complies in all material respects with the requirements specified in such form, except
as described above or below and subject to exceptions consistent with the presentation of information in the offering
circular; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to (i) comply with Regulation G under the
Exchange Act or Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K with respect to any “non-GAAP” financial information contained
therein, (ii) provide any information that is not otherwise similar to information currently included in the offering
circular or (iii) provide separate financial statements or other information contemplated by Rule 3- 09, Rule 3-10 or
Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X, or in each case any successor provisions or any schedules required by Regulation S-X.
In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will not be required to (i) comply with Sections 302, 906
and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or (ii) otherwise furnish any information, certificates or
reports required by Items 307 or 308 of Regulation S-K. To the extent any such information is not so filed or
furnished, as applicable, within the time periods specified above and such information is subsequently filed or
furnished, as applicable, the Company will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations with respect thereto at such
time and any Default with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been cured; provided that such cure shall not
otherwise affect the rights of the Holders under “—Events of Default” if Holders of at least 30% in principal amount
of the then total outstanding Notes have declared the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary
obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately and such declaration shall not have
been rescinded or cancelled prior to such cure. In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Company
will agree that, for so long as any Notes are outstanding, it will furnish to Holders and to securities analysts and
prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4)
under the Securities Act.

Substantially concurrently with the furnishing or making such information available to the Trustee pursuant
to the immediately preceding paragraph, the Company shall also use its commercially reasonable efforts to post
copies of such information required by the immediately preceding paragraph on a website (which may be nonpublic
and may be maintained by the Company or a third party) to which access will be given to Holders, prospective
investors in the Notes (which prospective investors shall be limited to “qualified institutional buyers” within the
meaning of Rule 144A of the Securities Act or non-U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities
Act) that certify their status as such to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company), and securities analysts and
market making financial institutions that are, in the case of securities analysts and market making financial
institutions, reasonably satisfactory to the Company. To the extent the Company determines in good faith that it
cannot make such reports available in the manner described in the preceding sentence after the use of its
commercially reasonable efforts, the Company shall furnish such reports to the Holders of the Notes, upon their
request. The Company may condition the delivery of any such reports to such Holders, prospective investors in the
Notes, and securities analysts and market making financial institutions on the agreement of such Persons to (i) treat
all such reports (and the information contained therein) and information as confidential, (ii) not use such reports and
the information contained therein for any purpose other than their investment or potential investment in the Notes
and (iii) not publicly disclose any such reports (and the information contained therein) and information.

The Company will also hold quarterly conference calls for the Holders of Notes, prospective investors in the
Notes and securities analysts and market making financial institutions, to discuss financial information for the
previous quarter (it being understood that such quarterly conference call may be the same conference call as with the
Company’s (or as applicable, any of any Parent Entity’s) equity investors and analysts). The conference call will be
following the last day of each fiscal quarter of the Company and not later than 10 Business Days from the time that
the Company distributes the financial information as set forth in the third preceding paragraph. No fewer than two

57


-----

days prior to the conference call, the Company will issue a press release or otherwise announce the time and date of
such conference call and providing instructions for Holders, securities analysts, prospective investors and market
making financial institutions to obtain access to such call.

If the Company has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries and such Unrestricted
Subsidiaries hold in the aggregate more than 5.0% of the Total Assets of the Company, then the annual and quarterly
financial information required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant will include a reasonably
detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, and in “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of the financial condition and results of
operations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of
operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Company.

The Indenture will permit the Company to satisfy its obligations in this covenant with respect to financial
information relating to the Company by furnishing financial information relating to a Parent Entity; provided that
the same is accompanied by consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the
information relating to such Parent Entity (and other direct or indirect Parent Entities included in such information,
if any), on the one hand, and the information relating to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone
basis, on the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, the consolidating information referred to in the proviso in the
preceding sentence need not be audited.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, if the Company or any Parent Entity of the
Company has furnished the Holders of Notes or filed with the SEC the reports described in the preceding paragraphs
with respect to the Company or any Parent Entity, the Company shall be deemed to be in compliance with the
provisions of this covenant.

The Trustee shall have no duty to review or analyze any reports furnished or made available to it and the
Trustee’s receipt of such reports shall not constitute actual or constructive knowledge of the information contained
therein or determinable therefrom, including the Company’s compliance with any of its covenants (as to which the
Trustee is entitled to conclusively rely on an Officer’s Certificate).

**_Limitation on Guarantees_**

The Company will not permit any of its Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiaries that are Restricted
Subsidiaries (and non-Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiaries if such non-Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiaries
guarantee, or are a co-issuer of, other capital markets debt securities of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or
guarantee all or a portion of, or are a co-borrower under, the Credit Agreement), other than a Guarantor, to
Guarantee the payment of any Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor, unless:

(1) such Restricted Subsidiary within 60 days executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to the
Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary, except that with respect to a
guarantee of Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor, if such Indebtedness is by its express
terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee, any such
guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in
right of payment to such Guarantee substantially to the same extent as such Indebtedness is
subordinated to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Guarantee of the Notes; and

(2) such Restricted Subsidiary waives and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or
advantage of, any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any other rights against the
Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary as a result of any payment by such Restricted Subsidiary
under its Guarantee until payment in full of Obligations under the Indenture.

_provided that this covenant shall not be applicable (i) to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed at_
the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation

58


-----

of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) in the event that the Guarantee of the Company’s
obligations under the Notes or the Indenture by such Subsidiary would not be permitted under applicable law.

The Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause any Subsidiary that is not otherwise required to be a
Guarantor to become a Guarantor, in which case, such Subsidiary shall not be required to comply with the 60-day
period described above.

If any Guarantor becomes an Immaterial Subsidiary, the Company shall have the right, by execution and
delivery of a supplemental indenture to the Trustee, to cause such Immaterial Subsidiary to cease to be a Guarantor,
subject to the requirement described in the first paragraph above that such Subsidiary shall be required to become a
Guarantor if it ceases to be an Immaterial Subsidiary (except that if such Subsidiary has been properly designated as
an Unrestricted Subsidiary it shall not be so required to become a Guarantor or execute a supplemental indenture);
_provided, further, that such Immaterial Subsidiary shall not be permitted to Guarantee the Credit Agreement or other_
Indebtedness of the Company or the other Guarantors, unless it again becomes a Guarantor.

**_Merger, Amalgamation and Consolidation_**

The Company

The Company will not consolidate with or merge or amalgamate with or into or convey, transfer or lease all
or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to any Person, unless:

(1) the Company is the surviving Person or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor
Company”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America,
any State of the United States or the District of Columbia and the Successor Company (if not the
Company) will expressly assume, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, all
the obligations of Company under the Notes and the Indenture and if such Successor Company is not a
corporation, a co-obligor of the Notes is a corporation organized or existing under such laws;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the applicable Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the applicable Successor
Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the applicable Successor Company
or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), none of the Events of Default described in clauses
(1), (2) or (5) thereof shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) upon execution of an agreement to enter into such transaction, no Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, and, immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction, either (a) the
applicable Successor Company would be able to Incur at least an additional $1.00 of Indebtedness
pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b)
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries would not be lower
than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel,
each stating that such consolidation, merger, amalgamation or transfer and such supplemental
indenture (if any) comply with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel stating that such supplemental
indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding
agreement enforceable against the Successor Company, provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel,
counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to satisfaction of
clauses (2) and (3) above.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of,
the Company under the Notes and the Indenture.

59


-----

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2), (3) and (4) (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this
sentence), (a) any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge or
amalgamate into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Company, (b) any Restricted Subsidiary may
consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge or amalgamate into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets
to any other Restricted Subsidiary and (c) the Company and its Restricted Subsidiary may complete any Permitted
Tax Restructuring. Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) (which do not apply to the transactions
referred to in this sentence), the Company may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge or amalgamate into
an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Company,
reincorporating the Company in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Company.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly,
in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of this section) shall not apply to the
creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company.

Guarantors

No Guarantor may:

(1) consolidate with or merge or amalgamate with or into any Person, or

(2) sell, convey, transfer or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or a series of
related transactions, to any Person, or

(3) permit any Person to merge or amalgamate with or into such Guarantor, unless

(A) the other Person is the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a
Guarantor concurrently with the transaction; or

(B) (1) either (x) the Company or a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving
or transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Note
Guarantee and the Indenture; and (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default
has occurred and is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition or transfer (including by way of
consolidation, merger or amalgamation) of the Guarantor or the conveyance, transfer, lease, sale
or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (in each case other than to the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Indenture.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly,
in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**Certain Compliance Calculations**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof)
is incurred or issued, any Lien is incurred or other transaction is undertaken in reliance on any ratio based
exceptions, thresholds and baskets, such ratio(s) shall be calculated with respect to such incurrence, issuance or
other transaction without giving effect to amounts being utilized under any other exceptions, thresholds or baskets
(other than ratio based baskets) on the same date. Each item of Indebtedness that is incurred or issued, each Lien
incurred and each other transaction undertaken will be deemed to have been incurred, issued or taken first, to the
extent available, pursuant to the relevant ratio based test.

60


-----

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof)
is incurred or issued, any Lien is incurred or other transaction is undertaken in reliance on any ratio based
exceptions, thresholds and baskets, such ratio(s) shall be calculated without regard to the incurrence of any
Indebtedness under any revolving facility or letter of credit facility (1) immediately prior to or in connection
therewith or (2) used to finance working capital needs of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

The Indenture shall provide that any calculation or measure that is determined with reference to the
Company’s financial statements (including Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Interest Expense, Consolidated
Net Income, Fixed Charges, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio and
Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio) may be determined with reference to the financial statements of a Parent
Entity instead, so long as such Parent Entity does not hold any material assets other than, directly or indirectly, the
Capital Stock of the Company.

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, any Investments, acquisitions, dispositions,
mergers, amalgamations, consolidations, operational changes, business expansions and disposed or discontinued
operations that have been made by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, during the reference period
or subsequent to the reference period and on or prior to or simultaneously with the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
Calculation Date shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions,
dispositions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations, operational changes, business expansions and disposed or
discontinued operations (and the change in any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in Consolidated
EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the reference period. If since the beginning of such
period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged or amalgamated with or into
the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period shall have made any
Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, operational change, business expansion,
or disposed or discontinued operation that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such
Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or disposed operation had occurred at
the beginning of the reference period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction (including the
Transactions), the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting
officer of the Company (and may include, for the avoidance of doubt, cost savings, operating expenses reductions
and synergies resulting from such transactions which is being given pro forma effect). If any Indebtedness bears a
floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as
if the rate in effect on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire
reference period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a
Finance Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible
financial or accounting officer of the Company to be the rate of interest implicit in such Finance Lease Obligation
in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making the computation referred to above, interest on any
Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed with a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the
average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the reference period except as set forth in the first paragraph of
this definition. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of
a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based
upon the rate actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Company may
designate.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

61


-----

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Company or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days after written notice by the Trustee on
behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes with any agreement or obligation contained in the Indenture; provided that in the
case of a failure to comply with the Indenture provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—
Reports,” such period of continuance of such default or breach shall be 270 days after written notice
described in this clause (3) has been given;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any
Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary) (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Company or any Significant
Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary)) other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary
whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date hereof, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after
giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (“payment
_default”); or_

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the “cross
_acceleration provision”);_

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of
any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default of principal at its stated
final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, aggregates to the greater of $125.0 million and 25% of LTM EBITDA (measured at the
date of such non-payment or acceleration) or more at any one time outstanding;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Company or a Significant
Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated
financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), to pay final judgments aggregating in excess
of the greater of $125.0 million and 25% of LTM EBITDA (measured at the date of such judgment)
other than any judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies issued by,
reputable and creditworthy companies, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and
unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such
judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor
upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed (the “judgment default provision”); or

(7) any Guarantee of the Notes by a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect, other than

(1) in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, (2) a Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary
denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Guarantee of the Notes, other than in accordance with the
terms thereof or upon release of such Note Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture or (3) in
connection with the bankruptcy of a Guarantor, so long as the aggregate assets of such Guarantor and
any other Guarantor whose Note Guarantee ceased or ceases to be in full force as a result of a

62


-----

bankruptcy are less than the greater of $125.0 million and 25% of LTM EBITDA (measured at the date
of such bankruptcy).

However, a Default under clause (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the
Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Company of the
Default and, with respect to clause (6), the Company does not cure such Default within the time specified in clause
(6) of this paragraph after receipt of such notice; provided that a notice of Default may not be given with respect to
any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more than two years prior to such notice of Default. Any
notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of
acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each a
“Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder delivered to the
Company and the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such
Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which
representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of Default (a “Default
_Direction”) shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise_
ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a
Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Company with such other information as the Company may
reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Noteholder’s Position Representation
within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC
or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the
beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such
Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in
breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Company
has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at
such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default or acceleration (or
notice thereof) that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Event of
Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be
automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of
competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration
of the Notes, the Company provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to
satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the
cure period with respect to any Default or Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction
shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any
breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being
disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders
that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction,
such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to
have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction
or any notice of such Default or Event of Default.

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction
delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar
proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction
delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any
Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s
Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to
Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. The
Trustee shall have no liability to the Company, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a
Noteholder Direction.

63


-----

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the
Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company or the Holders of at least 30% in principal
amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Company and the Trustee may, and the Trustee (subject to
certain conditions) at the request of such holders shall, declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an
Event of Default described in clause (4) under “—Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration
of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled, waived and rescinded if the event of default or payment
default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders
of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in
each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of the
acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Company occurs and is continuing,
the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and
payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all
past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal or interest which may
only be waived with the consent of each affected Holder) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such
Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate
in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such
Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that
resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or
Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain
Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of this
Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice
or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.
Any time period in the Indenture to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or
stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction to the extent such actual or alleged Default or Event of Default is the
subject of litigation.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the
request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security
satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of
principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the
Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security or indemnity
satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request
and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60day period.

64


-----

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are
given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and is known to the Trustee, the Trustee will be required in the
exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The
Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee
determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal
liability (it being understood that the Trustee has no duty to determine if any directed action is prejudicial to any
Holder). Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to
it against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses that may be caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such
occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being
notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of or interest on any Note, the
Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the
interests of the Holders. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each
fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during
the previous year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof,
written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what
action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Trustee will not be deemed to have
knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default, has
been delivered to the Trustee at its office specified in the Indenture and such notice references the Notes and the
Indenture and states that it is a “Notice of Default”.

The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of Default unless the Trustee has
actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in fact such a Default is received by the
Trustee at its office specified in the Indenture, and such notice references the Notes and this Indenture and states that
it is a “Notice of Default.”

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified
with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes) and, subject to certain
exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of
a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a
purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes). However, an amendment or waiver may not, with
respect to any such Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note (other than
provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note (other than provisions relating
to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which any
such Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any such Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Note;

(6) impair the contractual right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on such
Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such

65


-----

payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the amendment,
supplement or modification in accordance with the terms of the Indenture of the covenants described
above under the captions “—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants” and clauses (3), (4), (6)
and (7) of “—Events of Default” and the related definitions shall be deemed not to impair the
contractual right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on such Holder’s Notes
on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or with
respect to such Holder’s Note);

(7) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest
(except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in
aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such
acceleration);

(8) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described
in this sentence; or

(9) except as expressly permitted by the Indenture, modify the Note Guarantees of any Significant
Subsidiary in any manner materially adverse to the Holders.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Company, the Trustee and the other
parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Documents and the Company may direct the
Trustee to enter into an amendment to the Note Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency, conform any provision to this
“Description of the Notes,” or reduce the minimum denomination of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Company or a Guarantor
under any Note Document;

(3) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;

(4) add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any
right or power conferred upon the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect;

(6) at the Company’s election, comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with the
qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act, if such qualification is required;

(7) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Company) for the issuance of
Additional Notes;

(8) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance with the Covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” to add Guarantees with respect
to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release,
termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or Lien with respect to or securing the Notes when
such release, termination, discharge or retaking is provided for under the Indenture;

(9) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a successor Trustee
pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee to any Note
Document; or

administration of Notes; provided, however, that (i) compliance with the Indenture as so amended
would not result in Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable
securities law and (ii) such amendment does not adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes
in any material respect.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed
amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in connection
with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

**Defeasance**

The Company at any time may terminate all obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under the Note
Documents (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain
obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and
indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Company in connection therewith and obligations concerning
issuing temporary Notes, registrations of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an
office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust.

The Company at any time may terminate the obligations of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries
under the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) of “—Certain
Covenants—Merger, Amalgamation and Consolidation”) and “—Change of Control” and the default provisions
relating to such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a
payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Company and
Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision and the guarantee provision described under “—Events of
Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Company at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the
Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes so long as no Notes are then
outstanding. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the
Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3), (4), (5) (with respect only to
Significant Subsidiaries), (6) or (7) under “—Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Company (i) must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
“defeasance trust”) with the Trustee cash in U.S. dollars or U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof
for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may
be; provided, that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited
shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to
the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of
redemption (any such amount, the “Applicable Premium Deficit”) only required to be deposited with the Trustee on
or prior to the date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate
delivered to the Trustee at least two Business Days prior to the redemption date that confirms that such Applicable
Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption, and (ii) must comply with certain other conditions,
including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, stating
that Holders of the Notes, in their capacity as Holders of the Notes, will not recognize income, gain or
loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject
to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal
defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law since the issuance of the
Notes);

67


-----

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Company; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of transfer or
exchange of the Notes and indemnification rights of the Trustee, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all
Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or
destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds
have been released to the Company) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not
previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and
payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under
arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the
expense, of the Company; (2) the Company has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee, money in U.S.
dollars or U.S. Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and
discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal,
premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to
the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; provided that upon any redemption that requires the
payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the
extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the
notice of redemption, as calculated by the Company or on behalf of the Company by such Person as the Company
shall designate, with any Applicable Premium Deficit only required to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to
the date of redemption, and any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to
the Trustee at least two Business Days prior to the redemption date that confirms that such Applicable Premium
Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption; (3) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums
payable under the Indenture; and (4) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent under the “—Satisfaction and Discharge” section of
the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with; provided that any
such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the
foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Company or any of its respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Note
Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder
by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for
issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws
and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee**

Wilmington Trust, National Association will be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will
provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are
set forth specifically in such Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default known to the Trustee, the
Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care
that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain
from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

68


-----

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the
Company, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any
such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Company
and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture sets out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such terms
will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in principal
amount of then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Company and (2) that if
the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, (b) fails to meet certain
minimum limits regarding the aggregate of its capital and surplus or (c) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or
becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Company may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide
Holder for not less than 6 months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor
Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by
the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes and
expenses incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

All notices to Holders of Notes will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their
respective addresses in the register of the Holders of the Notes, if any, maintained by the registrar. For so long as
any Notes are represented by global notes, all notices to Holders of the Notes will be delivered to DTC in
accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of
this paragraph, which will give such notices to the Holders of book-entry interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more
than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the earlier of such publication and the fifth day after being so mailed.
Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other
equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to him if so mailed within the time prescribed.

Failure to electronically deliver or mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not
affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is electronically delivered or mailed
in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it.

“controlling” and “controlled” have meanings correlative to the foregoing.

respect to each applicable day during such week (or, if such statistical release is not so published or available, any
publicly available source of similar market data selected by the Company in good faith)) most nearly equal to the
period from the redemption date to, 2025; provided, however, that if the period from the redemption date
to, 2025 is not equal to the constant maturity of a United States Treasury security for which such yield is
given, the Applicable Treasury Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of
a year) from the weekly average yields of United States Treasury securities for which such yields are given, except

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the acquisition,
ownership and disposition of the Notes to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below and
collectively referred to as “holders”), but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential U.S. federal
income tax considerations that may be relevant to a holder. This summary is based on the provisions of the United
States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder,
judicial authority, published administrative positions of the IRS and other applicable authorities, all as in effect as of
the date of this document, and all of which are subject to change. Changes in such authorities or new interpretations
thereof may have retroactive effect and could significantly affect the U.S. federal income tax considerations
discussed below. We have not sought, nor do we intend to seek, a ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the
“IRS”) with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and there can be
no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with our statements and conclusions or that a court would sustain any
challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.

This summary applies only to holders (1) that purchase Notes in this offering for cash at their “issue price”
(generally, the initial price at which a substantial amount of the Notes are sold for cash to persons other than bond
houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or
wholesalers) and (2) that will hold their Notes as “capital assets” within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code
(generally, property held for investment). This summary is general in nature and does not purport to deal with all
aspects of U.S. federal income taxation or other tax considerations that might be relevant to particular holders in
light of their personal investment circumstances or status, nor does it address U.S. federal income tax considerations
applicable to holders that may be subject to special tax rules, such as banks and other financial institutions,
individual retirement and other tax-deferred accounts, tax-exempt entities, S corporations, partnerships or other
pass-through entities or arrangements for U.S. federal income tax purposes or investors in such entities or
arrangements, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, broker-dealers,
dealers or traders in currencies or securities that use a mark-to-market method of tax accounting, former citizens or
residents of the United States, governments and their controlled entities, persons subject to the personal holding
company or accumulated earnings rules, taxpayers subject to the anti-inversion rules, persons required to accelerate
the recognition of any item of gross income as a result of Section 451(b) of the Code, U.S. Holders that hold Notes
through non-U.S. brokers or other non-U.S. intermediaries, and taxpayers subject to the alternative minimum tax.
This summary also does not discuss Notes held as part of a hedge, straddle, synthetic security, conversion or other
integrated transaction, or situations in which the “functional currency” of a U.S. Holder is not the United States
dollar. Moreover, this summary also does not discuss any consequences resulting from the Medicare tax on net
investment income or the effect of any U.S. federal taxes other than income taxes (such as estate or gift taxes), or any
state, local or non-United States taxes.

In the case of Notes held by an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the tax treatment of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes to a partner in the partnership
generally will depend upon the tax status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership.
Partnerships or partners in partnerships considering an investment in the Notes should consult their tax advisors
regarding the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to them.

**THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT**
**A SUBSTITUTE FOR CAREFUL TAX PLANNING AND ADVICE. HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT**
**THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME**
**TAX LAWS TO THE ACQUISITION, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE NOTES IN LIGHT OF**
**THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS, AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER**
**OTHER U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-UNITED**
**STATES TAXING JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATY.**

107


-----

**Effect of Certain Contingencies on the Notes**

In certain circumstances (e.g., in the case of a change in control) we may be obligated to pay amounts in
excess of stated interest or principal on the Notes or in advance of their scheduled due dates. Our obligation to pay
such excess or accelerated amounts may implicate the provisions of the Treasury regulations relating to “contingent
payment debt obligations,” in which case the timing and amount of income inclusions and the character of income
recognized may be different from the consequences described herein. Under these Treasury regulations, however,
one or more contingencies will not cause a debt instrument to be treated as a contingent payment debt instrument if,
as of the issue date, such contingencies in the aggregate are considered “remote” or “incidental.”

Although the issue is not free from doubt, we believe and intend to take the position that the foregoing
contingencies should, in the aggregate, be treated as remote and/or incidental. Our position is binding on a holder,
unless the holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. However, our
position is not binding on the IRS, and we can give holders no assurance that our position would be sustained if
challenged by the IRS. A successful challenge of this position by the IRS could adversely affect the timing and
amount of a holder’s income with respect to the Notes, and holders subject to U.S. federal income tax might be
required to accrue income on the Notes based upon a “comparable yield” (as defined in the Treasury regulations) in
excess of stated interest and to treat any gain from the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note as ordinary income,
rather than capital gain. This summary assumes that the Notes will not be considered contingent payment debt
instruments. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application to the Notes of the
Treasury regulations relating to contingent payment debt obligations and the consequences thereof.

**Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders**

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is for U.S. federal
income tax purposes any of the following:

     - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

     - a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the
District of Columbia;

     - an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

     - a trust, if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over its
administration and one or more United States persons has the authority to control all of its
substantial decisions, or (ii) a valid election is in place under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations
to treat such trust as a domestic trust.

_Ownership of the Notes by U.S. Holders_

Stated Interest. Stated interest on a Note will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time
such payments accrue or are received in accordance with the U.S. Holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.

Sale, Exchange or other Taxable Disposition of the Notes. Upon the disposition of a Note by sale,
exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition, a U.S. Holder will generally recognize taxable gain or
loss equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount realized on the taxable disposition (other than any
amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxed as ordinary interest income to the
extent not previously included in income) and (ii) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note at the time of the
taxable disposition. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note generally will be the price paid therefor. Any
such gain or loss will generally constitute capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss to the extent
the U.S. Holder’s holding period for such Note is more than one year. Any such capital gain or loss will be shortterm capital gain or loss to the extent the U.S. Holder’s holding period for such Note is one year or less. Non
108


-----

corporate U.S. Holders, including individuals, are generally subject to a reduced U.S. federal income tax rate on net
long-term capital gains. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations under the Code.

_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_

In general, information reporting will apply to payments of stated interest and payments of the proceeds of
the sale or other taxable disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a Note to U.S. Holders other than
exempt recipients. Additionally, the applicable withholding agent may be required to impose backup withholding on
any payments of such amounts at a rate of 24% unless such U.S. Holder (i) establishes that it is a corporation or
comes within certain other exempt categories, or (ii) provides a correct taxpayer identification number, certifies as to
no loss of exemption from backup withholding and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup
withholding rules. Each U.S. Holder may provide its correct taxpayer identification number and certify that such
U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding by completing IRS Form W-9. Backup withholding is not an
additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from such payments may be allowed as a credit against such
U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability or may entitle such U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the
required information is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their
potential qualification for an exemption from backup withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an
exemption, if applicable.

**Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders**

For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, an individual, corporation, estate or trust that is not U.S. Holder.

_Ownership of the Notes by Non-U.S. Holders_

Payments of Interest on the Notes. Subject to the discussions of backup withholding and FATCA below,
payments of interest to a Non-U.S. Holder that is not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business carried on
by the Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax, provided that:

     - the Non-U.S. Holder does not own, actually or constructively, 10% or more of the total combined
voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote;

     - the Non-U.S. Holder is not a “controlled foreign corporation” related to us through stock
ownership;

     - the Non-U.S. Holder is not a bank that is receiving the interest on an extension of credit made
pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business; and

     - either (1) the Non-U.S. Holder provides an appropriate IRS Form W-8 (or a suitable substitute or
successor form or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) that has been properly completed
and duly executed establishing its status as a Non-U.S. Holder or (2) the Non-U.S. Holder holds
its Notes through certain foreign intermediaries or certain foreign partnerships and the Non-U.S.
Holder and such intermediary or partnership satisfy the certification requirements of applicable
Treasury regulations. Special certification rules apply to Non-U.S. Holders that are pass-through
entities.

If a Non-U.S. Holder cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest on a Note paid
to a Non-U.S. Holder that are not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business carried on by the Non-U.S.
Holder, will generally be subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a 30% rate (unless the rate is reduced
under an applicable income tax treaty and the Non-U.S. Holder claims the benefit of that treaty by providing an
applicable IRS Form W-8 (or a suitable substitute or successor form or such other form as the IRS may prescribe)
that has been properly completed and duly executed).

109


-----

If interest paid to a Non-U.S. Holder on a Note is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s
conduct of a trade or business within the United States, then the Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to U.S. federal
income tax on such amounts generally in the same manner as if such Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder, unless an
applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. In addition, if the Non-U.S. Holder is treated as a corporation for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Non-U.S. Holder may be subject to a branch profits tax on its effectively
connected earnings and profits, subject to adjustments, at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable
income tax treaty).

Sale, Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes. Subject to the discussions of backup
withholding and FATCA below, a Non-U.S. Holder will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any
gain recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note (other than any
amount representing accrued but unpaid interest on the Note, which is subject to the rules discussed above under
“Ownership of the Notes by Non-U.S. Holders—Payments of Interest on the Notes”) unless:

     - the gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. by the
Non-U.S. Holder; or

     - in the case of a Non-U.S. Holder who is a nonresident alien individual, such holder is present in the
United States for 183 or more days in the taxable year of the taxable disposition and certain other
requirements are met.

If a Non-U.S. Holder falls under the first of these exceptions, then unless an applicable income tax treaty
provides otherwise, the holder will be taxed on the net gain derived from the disposition of the Note generally in the
same manner as if such Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is treated as a corporation
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it may also be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or lower
applicable treaty rate) of the holder’s effectively connected earnings and profits, subject to certain adjustments.

If an individual Non-U.S. Holder falls under the second of these exceptions, the holder generally will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (unless a lower applicable treaty rate applies) on the amount by
which the capital gain derived from the disposition exceeds certain of such holder’s capital losses allocable to

_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_

The amount of interest on a Note paid to a Non-U.S. Holder and the amount of tax, if any, withheld from
such payment generally must be reported annually to the Non-U.S. Holder and to the IRS. The IRS may make this
information available under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty or agreement to the tax authorities in
the country in which the Non-U.S. Holder is resident or established.

Provided that a Non-U.S. Holder has complied with certain reporting procedures (usually satisfied by
providing an applicable properly completed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E) or otherwise establishes
an exemption, the Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to backup withholding tax with respect to interest
payments on a Note.

Rules relating to information reporting requirements and backup withholding with respect to the payment
of proceeds from the taxable disposition (including a redemption or retirement) of a Note are as follows:

     - If the proceeds are paid to or through the United States office of a broker, a Non-U.S. Holder
generally will be subject to backup withholding and information reporting unless the Non-U.S.
Holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is not a U.S. person (usually on an IRS Form
W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E) or otherwise establishes an exemption.

     - If the proceeds are paid to or through a non-U.S. office of a broker that is not a U.S. person and is
not a person that has certain specified U.S. connections (a “U.S. Related Person”), a Non-U.S.

110


-----

Holder will not be subject to backup withholding or information reporting.

     - If the proceeds are paid to or through a non-U.S. office of a broker that is a U.S. person or a U.S.
Related Person, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to information reporting (but
generally not backup withholding) unless the Non-U.S. Holder certifies under penalties of
perjury that it is not a U.S. person (usually on an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E) or
otherwise establishes an exemption.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
will be allowed as a credit against the Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, or may entitle the
Non-U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Non-U.S.
Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the backup withholding rules in their particular
circumstances and the availability of, and procedure for, obtaining an exemption from backup withholding under
current Treasury regulations.

**FATCA**

Under sections 1471 to 1474 of the Code (commonly referred to as “FATCA”), U.S. federal withholding
tax of 30% is generally imposed on interest income paid on a debt obligation issued by a United States corporation
and, subject to the regulatory relief described below, on the gross proceeds paid from the sale or other disposition of
such a debt obligation, to (i) a foreign financial institution (as the beneficial owner or as an intermediary for the
beneficial owner), unless such institution (a) enters into, and is in compliance with, a withholding and information
reporting agreement with the U.S. government to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial
information regarding U.S. account holders of such institution (which would include certain equity and debt
holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners) or (b) is a
resident in a country that has entered into an intergovernmental agreement with the United States in relation to such
withholding and information reporting and the financial institution complies with the related information reporting
requirements of such country or (ii) a foreign entity that is not a financial institution (as the beneficial owner or as an
intermediary for the beneficial owner), unless such entity provides the applicable withholding agent with a
certification identifying the substantial United States owners of the entity, which generally includes any United
States person who directly or indirectly owns more than 10% of the entity, or such entity otherwise qualifies for an
exemption from these rules. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and the applicable foreign
country, or future U.S. Treasury regulations or other guidance, may modify these requirements. Under proposed
U.S. Treasury regulations that may be relied upon pending finalization, the withholding tax on gross proceeds would
be eliminated and, consequently, FATCA withholding on gross proceeds is not expected to apply. Holders should
consult their tax advisors regarding the application of FATCA to Notes and their investment in the Notes.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and the Code impose
certain restrictions on (a) employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) that are subject to Title I of
ERISA, (b) plans, including individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975
of the Code or provisions under any federal, state, local, non-U.S., or other laws, rules or regulations that are
substantially similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, “Similar Laws”) and (c) entities whose
underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101 (as
modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA) or any applicable Similar Law of any such plans described in (a) or (b) above
(each, a “Plan”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of Plans subject to Title I of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions between an ERISA Plan
and fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary
authority or control over the administration of an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of an
ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation (direct or indirect) to an ERISA
Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of such ERISA Plan. In considering an investment of a portion of the
assets of any Plan in the Notes, a fiduciary (taking into account the facts and circumstances of the Plan) should
determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including,
without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of
ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws. A fiduciary can be personally liable for losses incurred by
a Plan resulting from a breach of fiduciary duties and can be subject to other adverse consequences.

Each Plan should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, any of the Guarantors, the initial purchasers or
any of their respective affiliates will act as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the decision to acquire the Notes
and is not undertaking to provide any advice or recommendation, including, without limitation, in a fiduciary
capacity, with respect to such decision.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of
Section 3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an
exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited
transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. Plans that
are “governmental plans” (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain “church plans” (as defined in
Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) are not subject to the
requirements of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code but may be subject to similar provisions under
applicable Similar Laws.

The acquisition and/or holding of the Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which we, any of the
Guarantors or the initial purchasers are considered a party in interest or disqualified person may constitute or result
in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless
the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited
transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class
exemptions, or PTCEs, that may apply to provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions
resulting from the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE
84-14, as amended, respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE
90-1, respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38, respecting bank-maintained collective
investment funds, PTCE 95-60, respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23, respecting
transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and
Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions between an ERISA Plan and a person that is a party in interest or

112


-----

disqualified person solely by reason of providing services to the ERISA Plan or a relationship with such service
provider, provided that neither the person transacting with the ERISA Plan nor an affiliate exercises any
discretionary authority or control with respect to the assets of the ERISA Plan involved in the transaction or renders
investment advice with respect to such assets, and provided further that the ERISA Plan pays no more than and
receives no less than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. There can be no assurance that all of
the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied.

In addition, a fiduciary of an ERISA Plan that engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be
subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. Accordingly, each purchaser of the Notes and
subsequent transferee that is or may become a Plan is responsible for determining that its purchase and holding of
such Notes will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

**Representation**

By acceptance of the Notes, each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have represented and warranted
that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser to acquire and hold Notes constitutes assets of any Plan
or (ii) the acquisition and holding of the Notes by such purchaser will not constitute or result in a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation under any
applicable Similar Laws, and none of the Issuer, any of the Guarantors, the initial purchasers or any of their
respective affiliates will act as a fiduciary to such purchaser with respect to the decision to acquire and hold the
Notes.

THE PRECEDING DISCUSSION IS ONLY A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN ERISA IMPLICATIONS OF
AN INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE COMPLETE. PROSPECTIVE
INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR OWN LEGAL, TAX, FINANCIAL AND OTHER ADVISORS
PRIOR TO INVESTING IN THE NOTES REGARDING THE SUITABILITY OF THE ACQUISITION OF THE
NOTES IN LIGHT OF SUCH INVESTOR’S PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.

113


-----

**BOOK ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

The Notes are being offered and sold to (a) persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers
in reliance on Rule 144A (“Rule 144A Notes”) or (b) persons other than U.S. persons in offshore transactions in
reliance on Regulation S (“Regulation S Notes”). Except as set forth below, the Notes will be issued in registered,
global form in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Notes will be
issued at the closing of this offering only against payment in immediately available funds.

Rule 144A Notes representing the Notes initially will be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons (the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). Regulation S Notes representing the
Notes initially will be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons (the
“Regulation S Global Notes”). Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of this
offering and the closing of this offering (the “Distribution Compliance Period”), beneficial interests in the
Regulation S Global Notes may be held only through the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking,
S.A. (“Clearstream”) (as indirect participants in DTC), unless transferred to a person that takes delivery through a
Rule 144A Global Note in accordance with the certification requirements described below under “Exchanges
Among Global Notes.” Rule 144A Global Notes and Regulation S Global Notes are collectively referred to herein as
“Global Notes.”

Global Notes will be deposited upon issuance with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the
“Trustee”) as custodian for DTC and registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, in each case for credit to an
account of a direct or indirect participant in DTC as described below. Beneficial interests in Rule 144A Global
Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in Regulation S Global Notes at any time except in the limited
circumstances described below. See “—Exchanges Among Global Notes.” Except as set forth below, Global Notes
may be transferred only to another nominee of DTC or to a successor of DTC or its nominee, in whole and not in
part. Except in the limited circumstances described below, beneficial interests in Global Notes may not be
exchanged for Notes in certificated form and owners of beneficial interests in Global Notes will not be entitled to
receive physical delivery of Notes in certificated form. See “—Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes.”

Global Notes (including beneficial interests in the Notes they represent) will be subject to certain
restrictions on transfer and will bear restrictive legends as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition,
transfers of beneficial interests in Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of DTC and its
direct or indirect participants (including Euroclear and Clearstream), which may change from time to time.

**Depository Procedures**
The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream is provided
solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective
settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these operations and
procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

DTC has advised us that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New
York, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal
Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing
agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold
securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and
settlement of transactions in those securities between Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts
of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks,
trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to
other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial
relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who
are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the
Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on
behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants.

DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it:

114


-----

(1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the initial
purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and

(2) ownership of these interests in Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these
interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or
by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in
Global Notes).

Investors in Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants in DTC’s system may hold their interests therein
directly through DTC. Investors in Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein
indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) that are Participants in DTC. All interests in
a Global Note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Investors in Regulation S Global Notes
must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems,
or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period
(but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC
system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in Regulation S Global
Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books
of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of Euroclear, and Citibank, N.A.,
as operator of Clearstream which in turn hold such interests in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’
names on the books of DTC. Interests in a Global Note held through Euroclear or Clearstream may be subject to the
procedures and requirements of those systems (as well as to the procedures and requirements of DTC). The laws of
some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own and the
ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to Persons that are subject to those requirements will be
limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect
Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge those interests to Persons
that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of those interests, may be affected by
the lack of a physical certificate evidencing those interests.

Except as described below, owners of an interest in Global Notes will not have Notes registered in their
names, will not receive physical delivery of definitive notes in registered certificated form (“Certificated Notes”)
and will not be considered the registered owners or “Holders” thereof under the Indenture for any purpose.

Payments in respect of the principal of and premium and interest on a Global Note registered in the name of
DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered Holder under the Indenture. Under the
terms of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the Persons in whose names Notes, including Global
Notes, are registered as the owners of such Notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes.
Consequently, neither the Issuer, the Trustee or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee has or will have any
responsibility or liability for:

(1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or
payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records
relating to the beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes; or

(2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect
Participants.

DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as
the Notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on
the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on that payment date. Each relevant
Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount
of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants
to the beneficial owners of Notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the
responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or
the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its Participants in

115


-----

identifying the beneficial owners of any Notes, and the Issuer and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be
protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes.

Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between Participants in
DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds and transfers
between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and
operating procedures.

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes described herein, cross-market
transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand,
will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case
may be, by its respective depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to
Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and
procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the
case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective
depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant
Global Note from DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds
settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions
directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a Holder of Notes only at the
direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only
in respect of the portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes as to which that Participant or those
Participants has or have given the relevant direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the Notes, DTC
reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute those Notes
to its Participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in Global Notes among Participants, they are under no obligation to perform those
procedures, and may discontinue or change those procedures at any time.

Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the
performance by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or their respective Participants or Indirect Participants of their
respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes**

A Global Note is exchangeable for a Certificated Note if:

   - DTC (a) notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the applicable Global
Notes or (b) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in each case, a
successor depositary is not appointed;

   - we at our option, notify, the Trustee in writing that we elect to cause the issuance of Certificated Notes
(although Regulation S Global Notes at the Issuer’s election pursuant to this clause may not be
exchanged for Certificated Notes prior to (a) the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period and (b)
the receipt of any certificates required under the provisions of Regulation S); or

   - there has occurred and is continuing a Default or event of default with respect to the Notes.

In addition, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Notes upon prior
written notice given to the Issuer and the Registrar by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the Indenture. In all
cases, Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests in a Global Note will be
registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the depositary (in
accordance with its customary procedures) and will bear the applicable restrictive legend referred to in “Transfer
Restrictions,” unless that legend is not required by applicable law.

116


-----

**Exchange of Certificated Notes for Global Notes**

If Certificated Notes are issued in the future, they will not be exchangeable for beneficial interests in any
Global Note unless the transferor first delivers to the Issuer and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that the transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions
applicable to the Notes being transferred. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Exchanges Among Global Notes**

Prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global
Note may be exchanged for beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note only if:

   - the exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the Notes pursuant to Rule 144A; and

   - the transferor first delivers to the Issuer and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that the Notes are being transferred: (a) to a Person who (i) the transferor
reasonably believes to be a qualified institutional buyer within the meaning of Rule 144A and (ii) is
purchasing for its own account or the account of a qualified institutional buyer in a transaction meeting
the requirements of Rule 144A; and (b) in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of
the United States and other jurisdictions.

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the
form of an interest in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the Distribution
Compliance Period, only if the transferor first delivers to the Issuer and the Registrar a written certificate (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that the transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903 or Rule 904
of Regulation S or Rule 144.

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between a Regulation S Global Note and a Rule 144A
Global Note will be effected in DTC by means of an instruction originated by the DTC Participant through the DTC
Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments
will be made to reflect the changes in the principal amounts of the Regulation S Global Note and the Rule 144A
Global Note, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a Person who
takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in the
original Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be
subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interest in the other Global Note.

**Same Day Settlement and Payment**

We will make payments in respect of Notes represented by Global Notes, including payments of principal,
premium, if any, and interest by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the DTC
or its nominee. We will make all payments of principal of and premium, if any, and interest on Certificated Notes by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holders of the Certificated Notes or, if
no account is specified, by mailing a check to each Holder’s registered address. See “Description of the Notes—
Principal, Maturity and Interest.” Notes represented by Global Notes are expected to be eligible to trade in DTC’s
Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity in Notes represented by
Global Notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available funds. Because of time zone
differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant purchasing an interest in a Global Note
from a Participant will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream
participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear and
Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. DTC has advised us that cash received in Euroclear
or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant
to a Participant will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC but will be available in the relevant
Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s
settlement date.

117


-----

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any other applicable
securities law and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S.
persons (as such terms are defined under the Securities Act) except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and such other securities laws.
Accordingly, the Notes are being offered hereby only (a) to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional
buyers (as defined in Rule 144A) in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act provided by Rule 144A and (b) outside the United States to persons other than U.S. persons in reliance upon
Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Each purchaser of the Notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented
to, and agreed with us and the initial purchasers as follows:

(1) It understands and acknowledges that the Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any
other applicable securities law, the Notes are being offered for resale in transactions not requiring
registration under the Securities Act or any other securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A,
and none of the Notes may be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the
registration requirements of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities law, pursuant to an
exemption therefrom or in a transaction not subject thereto and in each case in compliance with the
conditions for transfer set forth in paragraph (4) below.

(2) It is either:

(A) a qualified institutional buyer and is aware that any sale of the Notes to it will be made in
reliance on Rule 144A. Such acquisition will be for its own account or for the account of another
qualified institutional buyer, or

(B) an institution that, at the time the buy order for the Notes was originated, was outside the United
States and was not a U.S. person (and was not purchasing for the account or benefit of a U.S.
person) within the meaning of Regulation S (an “Initial Foreign Purchaser”).

(3) It acknowledges that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the initial purchasers or any person
representing the Issuer or the Guarantors or the initial purchasers has made any representation to it with
respect to the Issuer, the Guarantors or the offering or sale of any Notes, other than the information
included in this Offering Circular, which Offering Circular has been delivered to it. Accordingly, it
acknowledges that no representation or warranty is made by the initial purchasers as to the accuracy or
completeness of such materials. It has had access to such financial and other information as it has
deemed necessary in connection with its decision to purchase any of the Notes, including an opportunity
to ask questions of and request information from the Issuer, the Guarantors and the initial purchasers,
and it has received and reviewed all information that it requested.

(4) It is purchasing the Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which it is acting
as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act, subject to any requirement of
law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all
times within its or their control and subject to its or their ability to resell such Notes pursuant to Rule
144A, Regulation S or any exemption from registration available under the Securities Act. It agrees on
its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing the Notes and each
subsequent holder of the Notes by its acceptance thereof will agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer
such Notes prior to the date which is one year after the later of the date of the original issue of the Notes,
the original issue date of any additional Notes and the last date on which we or any of our affiliates was
the owner of such Notes (the “Resale Restriction Termination Date”) only (a) to us or any of our
subsidiaries, (b) pursuant to a registration statement which has been declared effective under the
Securities Act, (c) for so long as the Notes are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person it
reasonably believes is a qualified institutional buyer that purchases for its own account or for the
account of a qualified institutional buyer to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in
reliance on Rule 144A, (d) pursuant to offers and sales to non-U.S. persons that occur outside the United

118


-----

States within the meaning of Regulation S under the Securities Act, (e) pursuant to an exemption from
registration provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act (if available) or (f) pursuant to any other
available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, subject in each of the
foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such
investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and to compliance with any
applicable state securities laws. The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to the
Resale Restriction Termination Date. Each purchaser acknowledges that we and the Registrar reserve
the right prior to any offer, sale or other transfer pursuant to clause (d) prior to the end of the 40-day
distribution compliance period within the meaning of Regulation S under the Securities Act or pursuant
to clauses (e) or (f) prior to the Resale Restriction Termination Date of the Notes to require the delivery
of an opinion of counsel, certifications and/or other information satisfactory to us.

Each certificate representing a note will include a legend substantially to the following effect:

THE NOTES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (“Credit Suisse”) is acting as representative of the initial purchasers
named below. Subject to the terms and conditions stated in the purchase agreement dated the date of this Offering
Circular, each initial purchaser named below has severally agreed to purchase, and we have agreed to sell to such
initial purchaser, the principal amount of Notes offered hereby set forth opposite such initial purchaser’s name.

**Principal Amount**
**of Notes Offered**

**Initial Purchaser** **Hereby**

Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC ............................................................................................. $
BofA Securities, Inc. .....................................................................................................................
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. .......................................................................................................

Total ..................................................................................................................................... $ 500,000,000

The purchase agreement provides that the obligations of the initial purchasers to purchase the Notes are
subject to approval of legal matters by counsel and to other conditions. The initial purchasers must purchase all the
Notes if they purchase any of the Notes.

The initial purchasers propose to resell the Notes at the offering price set forth on the cover page of this
Offering Circular within the United States to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers (as
defined in Rule 144A) in reliance on Rule 144A and outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S. The price
at which the Notes are offered may be changed at any time without notice. The initial purchasers may offer and sell
Notes through certain of their respective affiliates.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and
may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in
Regulation S) except in transactions exempt from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities
Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of Notes within the
United States by a dealer that is not participating in this offering may violate the registration requirements of the
Securities Act if that offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A.

We have agreed that, during the period from the date of this Offering Circular through and including the
date that is 60 days after the date of this Offering Circular, we and the Guarantors will not, without the prior written
consent of Credit Suisse, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities issued or guaranteed
by us or any of the Guarantors having a tenor of more than one year.

The Notes will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to
list the Notes on any securities exchange or automated inter-dealer quotation system. We cannot assure you that the
prices at which the Notes will sell in the market after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering prices or
that an active trading market for the Notes will develop and continue after this offering. The initial purchasers have
advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the Notes. However, they are not obligated to do so and
they may discontinue any market-making activities with respect to the Notes at any time without notice.
Accordingly, we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of, or the trading market for, the Notes.

In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell Notes in the open market.
Purchases and sales in the open market may include short sales, purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing
purchases:

     - Short sales involve secondary market sales by the initial purchasers of a greater number of Notes
than they are required to purchase in the offering.

     - Covering transactions involve purchases of Notes in the open market after the distribution has been
completed in order to cover short positions.

121


-----

     - Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase Notes so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a
specified maximum.

Purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases, as well as other purchases by the initial
purchasers for their own account, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the
Notes. They may also cause the price of the Notes to be higher than the price that would otherwise exist in the open
market in the absence of these transactions. The initial purchasers may conduct these transactions in the over-thecounter market or otherwise. If the initial purchasers commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue
them at any time.

The initial purchasers are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include
securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal
investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates have in
the past performed commercial banking, investment banking and advisory services for us from time to time for
which they have received customary fees and reimbursement of expenses and may, from time to time, engage in
transactions with and perform services for us in the ordinary course of their business for which they may receive
customary fees and reimbursement of expenses. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial
purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and
equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (which may include bank loans and/or
credit default swaps) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers and may at any time hold long
and short positions in such securities and instruments. Such investments and securities activities may involve
securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. Certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates
that have a lending relationship with us may hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk
management policies. A typical such hedging strategy includes the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates
hedging such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or
the creation of short positions in our securities. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make
investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or
financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such
securities and instruments.

Certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates may be holders of our 2024 Secured Notes and will
receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering in connection with the redemption of the 2024 Secured
Notes. In addition, certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates are lenders and/or agents under our ABL
Facility and have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for transactions under our
ABL Facility.

We have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the
Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to make because of any of
those liabilities.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on February , 2020, which
will be the business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement being referred to as
“T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle
in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who
wish to trade notes prior to the date that is two business days preceding the settlement date will be required, by
virtue of the fact that the Notes initially settle in T+, to specify an alternative settlement arrangement at the time
of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes which wish to trade the Notes during such
period should consult their advisors.

**PRIIPs Regulation – Prohibition of Sales to European Economic Area and the United Kingdom Retail**
**Investors**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or in the United
Kingdom (the “UK”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client
as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within

122


-----

the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer
would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified
investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information
document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling
the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or in the UK has been prepared and
therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the
UK may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom**

This Offering Circular is only being distributed to, and is only directed at, persons in the United Kingdom
that are qualified investors within the meaning of Article 2(1)(e) of the Prospectus Directive that are also (i)
investment professionals falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial
Promotion) Order 2005 (the “Order”), (ii) high net worth entities, and other persons to whom it may lawfully be
communicated, falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Order or (iii) persons to whom an invitation or
inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000) in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes may otherwise lawfully be communicated or
caused to be communicated (each such person being referred to as a “relevant person”). The Notes are only available
to, and any invitation, offer or agreement to subscribe, purchase or otherwise acquire such Notes will be engaged in
only with, relevant persons. Any person in the United Kingdom that is not a relevant person should not act or rely on
this document or any of its contents.

**Notice to Canadian Residents**

**Resale Restrictions**

The distribution of Notes in Canada is being made only in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and
British Columbia on a private placement basis exempt from the requirement that we prepare and file a prospectus
with the securities regulatory authorities in each province where trades of these securities are made. Any resale of
the Notes in Canada must be made under applicable securities laws which may vary depending on the relevant
jurisdiction, and which may require resales to be made under available statutory exemptions or under a discretionary
exemption granted by the applicable Canadian securities regulatory authority. Purchasers are advised to seek legal
advice prior to any resale of the securities.

**Representations of Canadian Purchasers**

By purchasing Notes in Canada and accepting delivery of a purchase confirmation, a purchaser is
representing to us and the dealer from whom the purchase confirmation is received that:

   - the purchaser is entitled under applicable provincial securities laws to purchase the Notes without the
benefit of a prospectus qualified under those securities laws as it is an “accredited investor” as defined
under National Instrument 45-106—Prospectus Exemptions;

   - the purchaser is a “permitted client” as defined in National Instrument 31-103—Registration
_Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations;_

   - where required by law, the purchaser is purchasing as principal and not as agent; and

   - the purchaser has reviewed the text above under Resale Restrictions.

**Conflicts of Interest**

Canadian purchasers are hereby notified that Credit Suisse is relying on the exemption set out in section
3A.3 or 3A.4, if applicable, of National Instrument 33-105—Underwriting Conflicts from having to provide certain
conflict of interest disclosure in this document.

**Statutory Rights of Action**

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies
for rescission or damages if the Offering Circular (including any amendment thereto) such as this document contains
a misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the
time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser of these
securities in Canada should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province
or territory for particulars of these rights or consult with a legal advisor.

**Enforcement of Legal Rights**

All of our directors and officers as well as the experts named herein may be located outside of Canada and,
as a result, it may not be possible for Canadian purchasers to effect service of process within Canada upon us or
those persons. All or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of those persons may be located outside of
Canada and, as a result, it may not be possible to satisfy a judgment against us or those persons in Canada or to
enforce a judgment obtained in Canadian courts against us or those persons outside of Canada.

**Taxation and Eligibility for Investment**

Canadian purchasers of Notes should consult their own legal and tax advisors with respect to the tax
consequences of an investment in the Notes in their particular circumstances and about the eligibility of the Notes
for investment by the purchaser under relevant Canadian legislation.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in Switzerland**

The Notes may not be publicly offered in Switzerland and will not be listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange
(the “SIX”) or on any other stock exchange or regulated trading facility in Switzerland. This document has been
prepared without regard to the disclosure standards for issuance prospectuses under art. 652a or art. 1156 of the
Swiss Code of Obligations or the disclosure standards for listing prospectuses under art. 27 ff. of the SIX Listing
Rules or the listing rules of any other stock exchange or regulated trading facility in Switzerland. Neither this
document nor any other offering or marketing material relating to the Notes or the offering may be publicly
distributed or otherwise made publicly available in Switzerland.

Neither this prospectus supplement nor any other offering or marketing material relating to the offering, the
issuer, or the Notes have been or will be filed with or approved by any Swiss regulatory authority. In particular, this
prospectus supplement will not be filed with, and the offer of Notes will not be supervised by, the Swiss Financial
Market Supervisory Authority, and the offer of Notes has not been and will not be authorized under the Swiss
Federal Act on Collective Investment Schemes (the “CISA”). The investor protection afforded to acquirers of
interests in collective investment schemes under the CISA does not extend to acquirers of Notes.
