SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, DATED AUGUST 9, 2016

**PRELIMINARY OFFERING CIRCULAR** **CONFIDENTIAL**

#### $750,000,000

## Builders FirstSource, Inc.
as Issuer
#### % Senior Secured Notes due 2024


Builders FirstSource, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Issuer” or “we”), is offering $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of
its % senior secured notes due 2024 (the “notes”).
The notes will mature on, 2024 and will bear interest at the rate of % per year. Interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears on and of each year, beginning on, 2017.
The notes will be redeemable in whole or in part at any time on or after, 2019. Up to 40% of the notes will also be
redeemable with the proceeds of certain equity offerings completed before, 2019. The redemption prices and payment of any
accrued and unpaid interest are described under “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.” At any time prior to, 2019,
the notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption, plus a “make-whole” premium. If we experience certain changes of
control (as defined in the indenture governing the notes (the “Indenture”)) or receive proceeds from certain asset sales, holders of the notes
will have the right to require us to repurchase the notes under the terms set forth herein. At any time and from time to time during the 36
month period following the issue date of the notes, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes issued
under the Indenture (including any additional notes issued under the indenture after the closing date) during each twelve-month period
commencing with the issue date of the notes at a redemption price of 103% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and
unpaid interest to the redemption date.
The notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior secured basis (the “guarantees”), by each of
the Issuer’s subsidiaries that guarantee its obligations under the senior secured term loan facility (the “First-Lien Facility”) and the senior
secured ABL facility (the “ABL Facility” and, together with the First-Lien Facility, the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”) (the
“guarantors”). Subject to certain exceptions, future subsidiaries that guarantee the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or certain other
indebtedness will also guarantee the notes.
The notes and the guarantees will be general senior secured obligations of the Issuer and the guarantors, pari passu in right of
payment with any existing and future senior indebtedness of the Issuer and the guarantors, secured on a first-priority basis by the Notes
Collateral (as defined herein) owned by the Issuer and the guarantors and on a second-priority basis by the ABL Collateral (as defined
herein) owned by the Issuer and the guarantors, in each case subject to certain liens permitted under the Indenture. The term “ABL
Collateral” includes all presently owned and after-acquired accounts receivable, inventory, rights of unpaid vendors with respect to
inventory, deposit accounts, commodity accounts, securities accounts and lock boxes, investment property, cash and cash equivalents, and
general intangibles, books and records, supporting obligations and documents and related letters of credit, commercial tort claims or other
claims related to and proceeds of each of the foregoing. “Notes Collateral” includes all collateral that is not ABL Collateral. We refer to the
ABL Collateral and the Notes Collateral collectively as the “Collateral.” The notes and the guarantees will be equal in priority to the FirstLien Facility and any future pari passu lien obligations of the Issuer and the guarantors with respect to the Notes Collateral owned by the
Issuer and the guarantors. The notes and the guarantees will be senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of the
Issuer and the guarantors, effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer and the guarantors, including the
Issuer’s existing 10.75% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Existing Unsecured Notes”), to the extent of the value of the Collateral owned by the
Issuer and the guarantors, and effectively senior to all existing and future indebtedness or other obligations of the Issuer and the guarantors
under the ABL Facility, to the extent of the value of the Notes Collateral owned by the Issuer and the guarantors. The notes and the
guarantees will be effectively subordinated to the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ existing and future indebtedness or other obligations under
the ABL Facility to the extent of the value of the ABL Collateral owned by the Issuer and the guarantors and any existing and future
indebtedness of the Issuer and the guarantors that is secured by liens on assets that do not constitute a part of the Collateral to the extent of
the value of such assets. The notes and the guarantees will be structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness and other
liabilities, including preferred stock, of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes.
The notes will not have the benefit of any registration rights and the Issuer has no intention to register the notes in the future.
We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to redeem all of our outstanding 7.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2021 (the
“Existing Secured Notes”), repay a portion of the First-Lien Facility and pay related transaction fees and expenses, with any residual net
proceeds being used for general corporate purposes. See “Use of Proceeds.”
**Investing in the notes involves risks. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 15.**
**Price for the notes:** **% plus accrued interest, if any, from** **, 2016.**
The notes and the guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Securities Act”), or any state securities laws and the notes are being offered and sold only to persons reasonably believed to be
“qualified institutional buyers” in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) and outside the United States in
accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S”). Prospective purchasers are hereby notified that the seller of the
notes may be relying on Rule 144A. For a description of restrictions on transfers of the notes, see “Transfer Restrictions.”
The Issuer does not intend to apply for listing of the notes on any securities exchange or for inclusion of the notes in any automated
quotation system.
The initial purchasers expect to deliver the notes to purchasers in book-entry form through the facilities of The Depository Trust
Company (“DTC”) on or about, 2016.

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on, 2016, which will
be the tenth business day following the date of pricing of the notes (such settlement being referred to as “T+ ”).
Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), trades in the
secondary market generally are required to settle in three business days, unless the parties to any such trade
expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes on the date hereof or on the next
succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially settle in T+, to specify an
alternative settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the
notes which wish to trade the notes during such period should consult their advisors.

We have prepared this offering circular solely for use in connection with the proposed offering of the notes
described herein. This offering circular is personal to each prospective investor and does not constitute an offer to
any other person or to the public generally to subscribe for or otherwise acquire securities. Distribution of this
offering circular to any person other than the prospective investor and any person retained to advise such
prospective investor with respect to its purchase is unauthorized, and disclosure of its contents, in whole or in
part, without our prior written consent, is prohibited. Each prospective investor, by accepting delivery of this
offering circular, agrees to the foregoing and to make no copies or reproductions of any kind of all or any part of
this offering circular or any documents referred to herein.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, except as reasonably necessary to comply with applicable
securities laws, prospective investors (and each employee, representative or other agent of a prospective investor)
may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. federal income tax treatment and tax
structure of the offering and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided
to prospective investors relating to such tax treatment and tax structure. For this purpose, “tax structure” is
limited to facts relevant to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the offering but does not include information
relating to the identity of the Issuer.

We, and not the initial purchasers, have furnished the information about us included in this offering circular.
The initial purchasers assume no responsibility for, and make no representation or warranty, express or implied,
as to the accuracy or completeness of the information included in this offering circular. Nothing included in this
offering circular is, or shall be relied upon as, a promise or representation by the initial purchasers as to the past
or future.

NONE OF THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (“SEC”), ANY STATE
SECURITIES COMMISSION OR OTHER U.S. REGULATORY AUTHORITY HAS APPROVED OR
DISAPPROVED OF THE NOTES NOR HAVE ANY OF THE FOREGOING AUTHORITIES PASSED UPON
OR ENDORSED THE MERITS OF THIS OFFERING OR THE ACCURACY OR ADEQUACY OF THIS
OFFERING CIRCULAR. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

Prospective investors must rely on their own examination of the Issuer and the terms of the offering,
including the merits and risks involved, in deciding whether to invest in the notes. Prospective investors should
not construe anything in this offering circular as legal, business or tax advice. Each prospective investor should
consult its own advisors as needed to make its investment decision and to determine whether it is permitted to
purchase the notes under applicable legal investment or similar laws or regulations. Prospective investors may be
required to bear the financial risks of an investment in the notes for an indefinite period of time.

This offering circular includes summaries believed to be accurate with respect to certain documents, but
reference is made to the actual documents for complete information. All such summaries are qualified in their
entirety by such reference. Copies of documents referred to herein will be made available to prospective
investors upon request to the initial purchasers or us.

The notes and the guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state
securities laws. Accordingly, the notes are being offered and sold only to persons reasonably believed to be
“qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A) and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in
offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S. The notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and
resale and may not be transferred or resold except in a transaction exempt from or not subject to the registration
requirements of the Securities Act or pursuant to an effective registration statement. Each purchaser of the notes
will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgments, representations and agreements relating to such
restrictions on transfer and resale as more fully described under the heading “Transfer Restrictions.”

We reserve the right to withdraw this offering of notes at any time and we and the initial purchasers reserve
the right to reject any commitment to subscribe for the notes in whole or in part and to allot each prospective
investor less than the full amount of notes subscribed for by such investor.

The Issuer’s name, logo and other trademarks mentioned in this offering circular are the property of their
respective owners.

   - you have reviewed this offering circular;

   - you are purchasing the notes only for your own account and not for resale;

   - you have had an opportunity to request from the Issuer any additional information that you need from the

   - you are a “qualified institutional buyer” (as defined in Rule 144A) or you are a person who is not a U.S.
person, such sale took place outside the United States and you qualify to purchase the notes in accordance
with Regulation S;

   - you are not relying on unauthorized information to make your investment decision; and

   - the initial purchasers are not responsible for, and are not making any representation to you concerning,
the future performance of the Issuer or the accuracy or completeness of this offering circular.

You must comply with all laws and regulations that apply to you in any place in which you purchase, offer
or sell any notes or possess or distribute this offering circular. You must also obtain, at your sole cost and
expense, any consents, waivers or approvals that you need in order to purchase the notes. Neither we nor the

Act. These exemptions apply to offers and sales of securities that do not involve a public offering. The notes will
be initially purchased by the firms that are listed on the cover of this offering circular, who are referred to in this
offering circular as the initial purchasers, in accordance with such exemptions. Any sale of these notes must be
subject to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

**DISCLOSURE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This offering circular and the documents incorporated by reference herein contain certain “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995 with respect to our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Words such as
“anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “could,” “would,”
“will,” “may,” “can,” “continue,” “potential,” “should” and the negative of these terms or other comparable
terminology often identify forward-looking statements. Statements in this offering circular and the documents
incorporated by reference that are not historical facts are hereby identified as “forward-looking statements” for
the purpose of the safe harbor provided by Section 21E of the Exchange Act, and Section 27A of the Securities
Act. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements, including the risks discussed in this offering circular, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 in Item 1A under “Risk Factors” as well as in Item 7A “Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
June 30, 2016 in Item 3 “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and the risks detailed
from time to time in our future SEC reports. Factors, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes
and results to be materially different from those contemplated include, among others:

   - dependence on the residential building industry, the commercial building industry, as well as the
economy, the credit markets and other important factors;

   - uncertainty surrounding the economy and credit markets;

   - cyclical and seasonal nature of the building products supply industry;

   - product shortages, fluctuations in the prices of raw materials, loss of key suppliers, and our dependence
on third-party suppliers and manufacturers;

   - additional impairment charges or the need to idle or permanently close under-performing locations;

   - our ability to renew long-term leases for our facilities;

   - influence of significant stockholders;

   - loss of significant customers;

   - competition in the highly fragmented building products supply industry;

   - pricing pressure from our customers;

   - our future capital needs and our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms;

   - our level of indebtedness and our ability to meet our obligations under our debt instruments;

iii


-----

   - our incurrence of additional indebtedness and our inability to take certain actions because of restrictions
in our debt agreements;

   - our reliance on our subsidiaries;

   - dependence on key personnel;

   - exposure to product liability, product warranty, casualty, construction defect and other liability claims;

   - variability of our quarterly revenues and earnings;

   - disruptions at our facilities or in our information technology systems;

   - our ability to execute our strategic plans;

   - effects of regulatory conditions on our operations;

   - exposure to environmental liabilities and regulation;

   - economic and financial uncertainty resulting from terrorism and war; and

   - risks related to the acquisition and integration of ProBuild Holdings, LLC (“ProBuild”), including:

    - our failure to obtain the anticipated benefits and costs savings from the acquisition; and

    - the impact of the additional debt we incurred to finance the acquisition.

Many of the important factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict.
You are cautioned not to put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date
of this offering circular or, in the case of documents incorporated by reference, as of the date of such documents.
Except as otherwise required by law, we do not assume any obligation to publicly update or release any revisions
to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this offering circular or to
reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

**NO REVIEW BY THE SEC; NO REGISTRATION RIGHTS**

This offering circular, as well as any other documents in connection with this offering, have not been and
will not be reviewed by the SEC. There are no registration rights associated with the notes or the guarantees and
we have no present intention to offer to exchange the notes and the related guarantees for notes and note
guarantees registered under the Securities Act or to file a registration statement with respect to the notes. The
Indenture will not be qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**

We have included certain financial measures in this offering circular that have not been calculated in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) in order to provide
investors with an alternative method for assessing our operating results in a manner that enables investors to
more thoroughly evaluate our current performance as compared to past performance. We also believe these nonGAAP measures provide investors with a better baseline for modeling our future earnings expectations. Our
management uses these non-GAAP measures for the same purpose. We believe that our investors should have
access to the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. These non-GAAP measures should be
considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for
or superior to GAAP results. Our calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to
similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We have provided a definition below for these non-GAAP
financial measures, together with an explanation of why management uses these measures and why management
believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors. For a reconciliation between these nonGAAP financial measures to the most closely comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with
GAAP, please see “Summary—Summary Historical Financial and Other Data.”

iv


-----

We define EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for depreciation and amortization, interest expense, net,
income tax expense, net and discontinued operations, net of tax. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA
adjusted for facility closure costs, stock compensation expense, transaction costs, gain (loss) on sale and
impairment of assets, the ProBuild Adjusted EBITDA contribution and other expenses. For the pro forma period,
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA combine the historical results of the Issuer with the historical results of
ProBuild giving effect to the ProBuild acquisition and related adjustments for pro forma results (see below for
further information). Our management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure in the
evaluation of our business and believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide a meaningful measure of
our performance because they eliminate the effects of period to period changes in taxes, costs associated with
capital investments, interest expense, stock compensation expense and other non-cash and non-recurring items.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly,
they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) or other financial measures
prepared in accordance with GAAP.

When evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, investors should consider, among other factors, (i)
increasing or decreasing trends in EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, (ii) whether EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
has remained at positive levels historically, and (iii) how EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA compares to our debt
outstanding. We provide a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income (loss).
Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income (loss) and may
vary among companies, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA presented by us may not be comparable to similarly
titled measures of other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA does not give effect to the cash we must use
to service our debt or pay income taxes and thus does not reflect the funds generated from or used in operations
or actually available for capital investments.

The “pro forma” information included or incorporated by reference in this offering circular was prepared in
accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. It combines the historical results of the Issuer for the periods
presented herein or incorporated by reference with the historical results of ProBuild for the periods presented
herein or incorporated by reference prior to the closing of the Issuer’s acquisition of ProBuild on July 31, 2015.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

The industry and market data presented in this offering circular are based on management’s own estimates,
internal company research and from third-party sources, and in each case, is believed by our management to be
reliable. This data is subject to change and cannot always be verified with complete certainty due to limits on the
availability and reliability of raw data, the voluntary nature of the data gathering process and other limitations
and uncertainties inherent in any statistical survey of market and industry data. We have not, and the initial
purchasers have not, independently verified such data and we do not, and the initial purchasers do not, make any
representation as to the accuracy or completeness of such information. While we are not aware of any
misstatements regarding any industry and market data presented herein, such data involve risks and uncertainties
and are subject to change based upon various factors, including those discussed under the heading “Risk Factors”
in this offering circular.

**Notes Offered . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** $750 million aggregate principal amount of % senior secured notes
due 2024.

**Maturity Date** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The notes will mature on, 2024.

**Interest . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Interest on the notes will accrue at a rate of % per annum. Interest
on the notes will be payable semi-annually in cash in arrears
on and of each year, commencing, 2017.
Interest will accrue from the issue date of the notes.

**Guarantees . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and
severally, on a senior secured basis by each of the Issuer’s
subsidiaries that guarantee its obligations under the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities. Subject to certain exceptions, future subsidiaries that
guarantee the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or certain other
indebtedness will also guarantee the notes. The guarantees will be
released in certain circumstances as described in “Description of the
Notes—Guarantees.”

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2016, those subsidiaries of the
Issuer that will not serve as guarantors accounted for a de minimis
percentage of the Issuer’s sales, Adjusted EBITDA, total assets and
total liabilities.

**Collateral . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The notes and the guarantees will be secured by a first-priority lien on
the Notes Collateral owned by the Issuer and the guarantors and on a
second-priority basis by the ABL Collateral owned by the Issuer and
the guarantors, in each case subject to certain liens permitted under
the Indenture.

No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in
connection with this offering, and the value of Collateral at any time
will depend on market and other economic conditions, including the
availability of suitable buyers for the Collateral. The liens on the
Collateral may be released without the consent of the holders of the
Notes if Collateral is disposed of in a transaction that complies with
the Indenture and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the
applicable security documents, including in accordance with the
provisions of the ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement and the Pari
Passu Intercreditor Agreement (each as defined herein). In the event
of a liquidation of the Collateral, the available proceeds may not be
sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes. See “Risk
Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—The

Collateral may not be valuable enough to satisfy all the obligations
secured by such Collateral” and “Description of the Notes—Notes
Collateral.”

**Ranking . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The notes and the guarantees will be the Issuer’s and the guarantors’
senior secured obligations and will:

                      - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future
senior indebtedness of the Issuer or the guarantors, including
obligations under the ABL Facility, the First-Lien Facility and the
Existing Unsecured Notes;

                      - rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated
indebtedness of the Issuer or the guarantors;

                      - be effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured
indebtedness of the Issuer and the guarantors, including obligations
under the Existing Unsecured Notes, to the extent of the value of
the Collateral owned by the Issuer or the guarantors;

                       - be effectively senior to all existing and future indebtedness or other
obligations of the Issuer and the guarantors under the ABL Facility,
to the extent of the value of the Notes Collateral owned by the
Issuer or the guarantors;

                      - be effectively subordinated to the existing and future indebtedness
or other obligations of the Issuer and the guarantors under the ABL
Facility, to the extent of the value of the ABL Collateral owned by
the Issuer or the guarantors;

                      - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness
of the Issuer and the guarantors that is secured by liens on assets
that do not constitute part of the Collateral to the extent of the value
of such assets; and

                      - be structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness
and other liabilities, including preferred stock, of the Issuer’s
subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes.

As of June 30, 2016, giving effect to the offering of the notes hereby
and the use of proceeds therefrom, we would have had approximately
$2,022.3 million of total debt outstanding, including $750.0 million of
senior secured notes offered hereby, additional secured debt
consisting of $471.9 million of borrowings under the First-Lien
Facility, $104.0 million of borrowings under the ABL Facility, with
$611.0 million of additional availability (subject to availability under
a borrowing base and after giving effect to $85.0 million of letters of
credit outstanding as of June 30, 2016) thereunder, and $417.6
million of Existing Unsecured Notes outstanding and $278.8 million
of existing lease finance obligations and capitalized lease obligations.

**Intercreditor Agreements and**
**Joinders . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The liens on the Collateral are subject to (i) the ABL-Notes
Intercreditor Agreement, dated as of May 29, 2013, by and between
the Issuer, SunTrust Bank, as ABL Agent, Wilmington Trust,
National Association, as Notes Collateral Agent for the Existing

Existing Secured Notes and the other parties thereto (the “Pari Passu
Intercreditor Agreement” and, together with the ABL/Bond
Intercreditor Agreement, the “Intercreditor Agreements”).

On the closing date, (i) the Issuer, the ABL Agent, Wilmington Trust,
National Association, as the collateral agent with respect to the notes
(the “Notes Collateral Agent”) and the Term Administrative Agent
and Term Collateral Agent will enter into a Lien Sharing and Priority
Confirmation Joinder to the ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement and
(ii) the Notes Collateral Agent will enter into an Additional
Authorized Representative Agent Joinder Agreement to the Pari
Passu Intercreditor Agreement (together, the “Joinders”), providing
that the liens on the Collateral securing the notes and the guarantees
will be subject to the Intercreditor Agreements.

**Optional Redemption** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . On or after, 2019, we may redeem some or all of the notes
at any time at the redemption prices described in the section
“Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.” Prior to such date,
we may redeem some or all of the notes at a redemption price of
100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
to, but excluding, the redemption date, plus a “make-whole”
premium. In addition, we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate
principal amount of the notes before, 2019 with the
proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of % of
the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time during the 36 month period
following the issue date of the notes, the Issuer may redeem up to
10% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes issued under the
Indenture (including any additional notes issued under the indenture
after the closing date) during each twelve-month period commencing
with the issue date of the notes at a redemption price of 103% of the
aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest
to the redemption date.

See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

**Change of Control** . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . If we experience certain kinds of changes of control, we must offer to
purchase the notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the purchase date. For
more details, see “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

**Mandatory Offer to Repurchase**
**Following Certain Asset Sales . . . . . .** If we sell certain assets and do not repay certain debt or reinvest the
proceeds of such sales within certain time periods, we must offer to
repurchase the notes as described under “Description of the Notes—
Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary
Stock.”

**Certain Covenants. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Indenture will contain covenants that limit, among other things,
our ability and the ability of some of our subsidiaries to:

                      - incur additional indebtedness;

                      - declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions
to stockholders;

                    - make investments;

                       - create liens or use assets as security in other transactions;

                       - merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of
substantially all of our assets;

                       - enter into transactions with affiliates;

                       - sell or transfer certain assets; and

                       - agree to certain restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries
to make payments to the Issuer.

These covenants are subject to a number of important qualifications
and limitations. In addition, so long as the notes have an investment
grade rating from any two of Standard & Poor’s Investors Ratings
Service, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings, Inc. we
will not be subject to certain of the covenants listed above. See
“Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants.”

**Transfer Restrictions & Listing . . . . . .** The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any
state securities laws and may not be offered or sold except pursuant to
an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.” We
do not intend to apply for listing of the notes on any securities
exchange or for inclusion of the notes in any automated quotation
system.

**No Registration Rights. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** We do not intend to register the notes under the U.S. federal or state
securities laws or under the securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

**Absence of an Established Market for**
**the Notes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The notes will be a new class of securities for which there is currently
no market. Although the initial purchasers have informed us that they
intend to make a market in the notes, the initial purchasers are not
obligated to do so and may discontinue market-making activities at
any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a
liquid market for the notes will develop or be maintained.

**Use of Proceeds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to redeem all of
the Existing Secured Notes, repay a portion of the First-Lien Facility

and pay related transaction fees and expenses, with any residual net
proceeds being used for general corporate purposes. See “Use of
Proceeds.”

**Original Issue Discount . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** If the stated principal amount of the notes exceeds their issue price by
an amount greater than or equal to a statutorily-defined de minimis
threshold, then the notes will be considered to be issued with original
issue discount (“OID”) for United States federal income tax purposes.
If the notes are issued with OID, then, in addition to the stated interest
on a note, a U.S. Holder (as defined in “Certain United States Federal
Income Tax Considerations”) generally will be required to include the
OID on such note in gross income (as ordinary income) as it accrues
on a constant yield basis for United States federal income tax
purposes, in advance of the receipt of the cash payments to which
such OID is attributable and regardless of the holder’s regular method
of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes. See
“Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations.”

**RISK FACTORS**

_Any investment in the notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described_
_below and all of the information contained in this offering circular and in the documents incorporated by_
_reference herein before deciding whether to purchase the notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are_
_not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or_
_that we currently deem immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business. If any of those risks_
_actually occurs, our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations would suffer. Along with_
_the risks and uncertainties described below, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described_
_in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in the Issuer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended_
_December 31, 2015, which is incorporated by reference into this offering circular. The risks discussed below also_
_include forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these_
_forward-looking statements. See “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this offering circular._

**Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry**

**The industry in which we operate is dependent upon the residential homebuilding industry, as well as the**
**U.S. economy, the credit markets and other important factors.**

The building products industry is highly dependent on new home and multifamily construction, which in
turn are dependent upon a number of factors, including interest rates, consumer confidence, employment rates,
foreclosure rates, housing inventory levels and occupancy, housing demand and the health of the U.S. economy
and mortgage markets. Unfavorable changes in demographics, credit markets, consumer confidence, housing
affordability, or housing inventory levels and occupancy, or a weakening of the U.S. economy or of any regional
or local economy in which we operate could adversely affect consumer spending, result in decreased demand for
our products, and adversely affect our business. Production of new homes and multifamily buildings may also
decline because of shortages of qualified tradesmen, reliance on inadequately capitalized builders and subcontractors, and shortages of suitable building lots and material. The homebuilding industry is currently
experiencing a shortage of qualified, trained labor in many areas, including those served by us. In addition, the
building industry is subject to various local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations
concerning zoning, building design and safety, construction, energy and water conservation and similar matters,
including regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of
homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area or in order to maintain certain areas as
primarily or exclusively residential. Regulatory restrictions may increase our operating expenses and limit the
availability of suitable building lots for our customers, which could negatively affect our sales and earnings.
Because we have substantial fixed costs, relatively modest declines in our customers’ production levels could
have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

The homebuilding industry underwent a significant downturn that began in mid-2006 and began to stabilize
in late 2011. U.S. homebuilding activity increased in 2014 and 2015 to approximately 647,800 and 714,700
single-family starts, respectively, although it remains well below the historical average (from 1959 through 2015)
of 1.0 million single-family starts per year. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, actual U.S. single family
housing starts in the U.S. during 2015 were 51.2% lower than in 2006. We believe that the slow recovery of the
housing market is due to a variety of factors including: a severe economic recession, followed by a gradual
economic recovery; limited credit availability; shortages of suitable building lots in many regions; shortages of
experienced labor; a substantial reduction in speculative home investment; and soft housing demand. The
downturn in the homebuilding industry resulted in a substantial reduction in demand for our products and
services.

In addition, beginning in 2007, the mortgage markets experienced substantial disruption due to increased
defaults, primarily as a result of credit quality deterioration. The disruption resulted in a stricter regulatory
environment and reduced availability of mortgages for potential homebuyers due to a tight credit market and

15


-----

stricter standards to qualify for mortgages. Mortgage financing and commercial credit for smaller homebuilders
continue to be constrained, which is slowing a recovery in our industry. Since the housing industry is dependent
upon the economy as well as potential homebuyers’ access to mortgage financing and homebuilders’ access to
commercial credit, it is likely that the housing industry will not fully recover until conditions in the economy and
the credit markets further improve.

**If the housing market declines, we may be required to take impairment charges relating to our operations**
**or temporarily idle or permanently close under-performing locations.**

We recorded no goodwill impairment charges in 2015 or 2014. In continuing operations for the year ended
December 31, 2015 we recorded impairment charges on held-for-use assets of $1.4 million related to customer
relationship intangibles associated with a location closure. We recorded no significant asset impairment charges
in continuing operations in 2014. If conditions in the housing industry deteriorate we may need to take goodwill
and/or asset impairment charges relating to certain of our reporting units. Any such non-cash charges would have
an adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, in response to industry conditions, we may have to
temporarily idle or permanently close certain facilities in under-performing regions. Any such facility closures
could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

**Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our**
**operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, and prevent us from**
**meeting our obligations under our debt instruments.**

As of June 30, 2016, our debt totaled $1,978.9 million, including $278.8 million of lease finance obligations
and capital lease obligations. We also have an $800 million ABL Facility. As of June 30, 2016, we had $104.0
million in borrowings, as well as $85.0 million of letters of credit, outstanding under the ABL Facility. In
addition, we have significant obligations under ongoing operating leases that are not reflected on our balance
sheet. After giving pro forma effect to this offering, as of June 30, 2016, our debt would have totaled $2,022.3
million, including $278.8 million of lease finance obligations and capital lease obligations.

Our substantial debt could have important consequences to us, including:

   - increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;

   - requiring a substantial portion of our operating cash flow to be dedicated to the payment of principal and
interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our liquidity and our ability to use our cash flow to fund
our operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities;

   - exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates, and corresponding increased interest expense, because
borrowings under the ABL Facility and the First-Lien Facility are at variable rates of interest;

   - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service
requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes; and

   - limiting our ability to adjust to changing marketplace conditions and placing us at a competitive
disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have less debt.

In addition, some of our debt instruments, including those governing the ABL Facility, the First-Lien
Facility, and the Existing Unsecured Notes, contain, and the Indenture will contain, cross-default provisions that
could result in our debt being declared immediately due and payable under a number of debt instruments, even if
we default on only one debt instrument. In such event, it is unlikely that we would be able to satisfy our
obligations under all of such accelerated indebtedness simultaneously.

16


-----

Our financial condition and operating performance and that of our subsidiaries are also subject to prevailing
economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control.
There are no assurances that we will maintain a level of liquidity sufficient to permit us to pay the principal,
premium and interest on our indebtedness.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be
forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our
indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled
debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial
liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations in an effort to meet our debt
service and other obligations. The agreements governing the ABL Facility and the First-Lien Facility and the
Existing Unsecured Indenture restrict, and the Indenture will restrict, our ability to dispose of assets and to use
the proceeds from such dispositions. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or be able to obtain
the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service
obligations then due.

**We may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms.**

We are substantially reliant on cash on hand and borrowing availability under the ABL Facility, which
totaled $617.2 million at June 30, 2016, to provide working capital and fund our operations. Our working capital
requirements are likely to grow assuming the housing industry improves. Our inability to renew, amend or
replace the ABL Facility, the First-Lien Facility, the Existing Unsecured Notes or the notes when required or
when business conditions warrant could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Economic and credit market conditions, the performance of our industry, and our financial performance, as
well as other factors, may constrain our financing abilities. Our ability to secure additional financing, if available,
and to satisfy our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time will depend upon our
future operating performance, the availability of credit, economic conditions and financial, business and
other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Any worsening of current housing market conditions or the
macroeconomic factors that affect our industry could require us to seek additional capital and have a material
adverse effect on our ability to secure such capital on favorable terms, if at all.

We may be unable to secure additional financing or financing on favorable terms or our operating cash flow
may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time,
including the notes, the Existing Unsecured Notes, the ABL Facility and the First-Lien Facility. The agreements
governing the ABL Facility and the First-Lien Facility and the Existing Unsecured Indenture, moreover, restrict,
and the Indenture will restrict, the amount of permitted indebtedness allowed. In addition, if financing is not
available when needed, or is available on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to take advantage of business
opportunities, including potential acquisitions, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If additional funds are
raised through the issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders may experience
significant dilution.

**We may incur additional indebtedness.**

We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including secured debt, subject to the restrictions
contained in the agreements governing the notes, the ABL Facility and the First-Lien Facility and the Existing
Unsecured Indenture. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could
intensify.

17


-----

**Our debt instruments contain various covenants that limit our ability to operate our business.**

Our financing arrangements, including the agreements governing the ABL Facility and the First-Lien
Facility and the Existing Unsecured Indenture, contain, and the Indenture will contain, various provisions that
limit our ability to, among other things:

   - transfer or sell assets, including the equity interests of our restricted subsidiaries, or use asset sale
proceeds;

   - incur additional debt;

   - pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock;

   - make certain restricted payments or investments;

   - create liens to secure debt;

   - enter into transactions with affiliates;

   - merge or consolidate with another company or continue to receive the benefits of these financing
arrangements under a “change in control” scenario (as defined in those agreements); and

   - engage in unrelated business activities.

The agreement governing the ABL Facility contains a financial covenant requiring the satisfaction of a
minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00 if our excess availability falls below the greater of $80
million or 10% of the maximum borrowing amount. As of June 30, 2016, our excess availability was $611.0
million.

These provisions may restrict our ability to expand or fully pursue our business strategies. Our ability to
comply with the agreements governing the notes, the ABL Facility and the First-Lien Facility and the Existing
Unsecured Indenture may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance, changes in general
business and economic conditions, adverse regulatory developments, a change in control or other events beyond
our control. The breach of any of these provisions, including those contained in the notes, the ABL Facility and
the First-Lien Facility and the Existing Unsecured Indenture, could result in a default under our indebtedness,
which could cause those and other obligations to become due and payable. If any of our indebtedness is
accelerated, we may not be able to repay it.

**We occupy most of our respective facilities under long-term non-cancelable leases. We may be unable to**
**renew leases at the end of their terms. If we close a facility, we are still obligated under the applicable**
**lease.**

Most of our facilities are leased. Many of our leases are non-cancelable, typically have initial expiration
terms ranging from five to 15 years and most provide options to renew for specified periods of time. We believe
that leases we enter into in the future will likely be of the same terms (five to 15 years), will be non-cancelable
and will feature similar renewal options. If we close or idle a facility we would remain committed to perform our
obligations under the applicable lease, which would include, among other things, payment of the base rent,
insurance, taxes and other expenses on the leased property for the balance of the lease term. Management may
explore offsets to remaining obligations such as subleasing opportunities or negotiated lease terminations. During
the period from 2007 through 2015, we closed or idled a number of facilities for which we continue to remain
liable. Our obligation to continue making rental payments with respect to leases for closed or idled facilities
could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. At the end of a lease term and any
renewal period for a leased facility, for those locations where we have no renewal options remaining, we may be
unable to renew the lease without additional cost, if at all. If we are unable to renew our facility leases, we may
close or, if possible, relocate the facility, which could subject us to additional costs and risks which could have a
material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, the revenue and profit generated at a relocated facility may
not equal the revenue and profit generated at the existing operation.

**The building supply industry is cyclical and seasonal.**

The building products supply industry is subject to cyclical market pressures. Prices of building products are
subject to fluctuations arising from changes in supply and demand, national and international economic
conditions, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulation, and trade policies, as well as
from periodic delays in the delivery of lumber and other products. For example, prices of wood products,
including lumber and panel products, are subject to significant volatility and directly affect our sales and
earnings. In particular, low prices for wood products over a sustained period can adversely affect our financial
condition, operating results and cash flows, as can excessive spikes in prices. For the year ended December 31,
2015, average prices for lumber and lumber sheet goods were 11.1% lower than the prior year. Our lumber and
lumber sheet goods product category represented 32.3% of total sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. We
have limited ability to manage the timing and amount of pricing changes for building products. In addition, the
supply of building products fluctuates based on available manufacturing capacity. A shortage of capacity or
excess capacity in the industry can result in significant increases or declines in prices for those products, often
within a short period of time. Such price fluctuations can adversely affect our financial condition, operating
results and cash flows.

In addition, although weather patterns affect our operating results throughout the year, adverse weather
historically has reduced construction activity in the first and fourth quarters in the regions where we operate. To
the extent that hurricanes, severe storms, floods, other natural disasters or similar events occur in the regions in
which we operate, our business may be adversely affected. We anticipate that fluctuations from period to period
will continue in the future.

**The loss of any of our significant customers or a reduction in the quantity of products they purchase could**
**affect our financial health.**

Following the ProBuild acquisition, our ten largest customers generated approximately 15.0% of our sales
for the year ended December 31, 2015 on a pro forma basis giving effect to the ProBuild acquisition. We cannot
guarantee that we will maintain or improve the relationships with these customers or that we will supply these
customers at historical levels. Due to the weak housing market over the past several years, many of our
homebuilder customers substantially reduced their construction activity. Some homebuilder customers exited or
severely curtailed building activity in certain of our regions.

In addition, production homebuilders, commercial builders and other customers may: (1) seek to purchase
some of the products that we currently sell directly from manufacturers, (2) elect to establish their own building
products manufacturing and distribution facilities or (3) give advantages to manufacturing or distribution
intermediaries in which they have an economic stake. Continued consolidation among production homebuilders
could also result in a loss of some of our present customers to our competitors. The loss of one or more of our
significant customers or deterioration in our relations with any of them could significantly affect our financial
condition, operating results and cash flows. Furthermore, our customers are not required to purchase any
minimum amount of products from us. The contracts into which we have entered with most of our professional
customers typically provide that we supply particular products or services for a certain period of time when and if
ordered by the customer. Should our customers purchase our products in significantly lower quantities than they
have in the past, such decreased purchases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
operating results and cash flows.

**Our industry is highly fragmented and competitive, and increased competitive pressure may adversely**
**affect our results.**

The building products supply industry is highly fragmented and competitive. We face, and will continue to
face, significant competition from local and regional building materials chains, as well as from privately-owned
single site enterprises. Any of these competitors may (1) foresee the course of market development more

19


-----

accurately than we do, (2) develop products that are superior to our products, (3) have the ability to produce or
supply similar products at a lower cost, (4) develop stronger relationships with local homebuilders or commercial
builders, (5) adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements than we do, or (6) have
access to financing on more favorable terms that we can obtain in the market. As a result, we may not be able to
compete successfully with them. In addition, home center retailers, which have historically concentrated their
sales efforts on retail consumers and small contractors, have intensified their marketing efforts to professional
homebuilders in recent years and may continue to intensify these efforts in the future. Furthermore, certain
product manufacturers sell and distribute their products directly to production homebuilders or commercial
builders. The volume of such direct sales could increase in the future. Additionally, manufacturers of products
distributed by us may elect to sell and distribute directly to homebuilders or commercial builders in the future or
enter into exclusive supplier arrangements with other distributors. Consolidation of production homebuilders or
commercial builders may result in increased competition for their business. Finally, we may not be able to
maintain our operating costs or product prices at a level sufficiently low for us to compete effectively. If we are
unable to compete effectively, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be adversely
affected.

**We are subject to competitive pricing pressure from our customers.**

Production homebuilders and commercial builders historically have exerted and will continue to exert
significant pressure on their outside suppliers to keep prices low because of their market share and their ability to
leverage such market share in the highly fragmented building products supply industry. The housing industry
downturn and its aftermath have resulted in significantly increased pricing pressures from production
homebuilders and other customers. Over the past few years, these pricing pressures have adversely affected our
operating results and cash flows. In addition, continued consolidation among production homebuilders or
commercial builders, and changes in production homebuilders’ or commercial builders’ purchasing policies or
payment practices, could result in additional pricing pressure, and our financial condition, operating results and
cash flows may be adversely affected.

**Our continued success will depend on our ability to retain our key employees and to attract and retain new**
**qualified employees.**

Our success depends in part on our ability to attract, hire, train and retain qualified managerial, operational,
sales and other personnel. We face significant competition for these types of employees in our industry and from
other industries. We may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining the personnel we require to conduct and
expand our operations successfully. In addition, key personnel may leave us and compete against us. Our success
also depends to a significant extent on the continued service of our senior management team. We may be
unsuccessful in replacing key managers who either resign or retire. The loss of any member of our senior
management team or other experienced senior employees could impair our ability to execute our business plan,
cause us to lose customers and reduce our net sales, or lead to employee morale problems and/or the loss of other
key employees. In any such event, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely
affected.

**The nature of our business exposes us to product liability, product warranty, casualty, construction defect,**
**asbestos, vehicle and other claims and legal proceedings.**

We are involved in product liability, product warranty, casualty, construction defect, asbestos, vehicle and
other claims relating to the products we manufacture and distribute, and services we provide that, if adversely
determined, could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. We rely on
manufacturers and other suppliers to provide us with many of the products we sell and distribute. Because we
have no direct control over the quality of such products manufactured or supplied by such third-party suppliers,
we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products. We are also involved in several asbestos personal
injury suits due to the alleged sale of asbestos-containing products by legacy businesses that we acquired. In

20


-----

addition, we are exposed to potential claims arising from the conduct of our respective employees and
subcontractors, and builders and their subcontractors, for which we may be contractually liable. Although we
currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate insurance in excess of our self-insured amounts,
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or that such
insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. Product liability, product warranty,
casualty, construction defect, asbestos, vehicle, and other claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the
attention of management and other personnel for significant periods, regardless of the ultimate outcome. Claims
of this nature could also have a negative impact on customer confidence in our products and our company. In
addition, we are involved on an ongoing basis in other types of legal proceedings. We cannot assure you that any
current or future claims against us will not adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash
flows.

**Product shortages, loss of key suppliers, and our dependence on third-party suppliers and manufacturers**
**could affect our financial health.**

Our ability to offer a wide variety of products to our customers is dependent upon our ability to obtain
adequate product supply from manufacturers and other suppliers. Generally, our products are obtainable from
various sources and in sufficient quantities. However, the loss of, or a substantial decrease in the availability of,
products from our suppliers or the loss of key supplier arrangements could adversely impact our financial
condition, operating results, and cash flows.

Although in many instances we have agreements with our suppliers, these agreements are generally
terminable by either party on limited notice. Failure by our suppliers to continue to supply us with products on
commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could put pressure on our operating margins or have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Short-term changes in the cost of these
materials, some of which are subject to significant fluctuations, are sometimes, but not always passed on to our
customers. Our delayed ability to pass on material price increases to our customers could adversely impact our
financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

**A range of factors may make our quarterly revenues and EBITDA variable.**

We have historically experienced, and in the future will continue to experience, variability in revenues and
EBITDA on a quarterly basis. The factors expected to contribute to this variability include, among others: (1) the
volatility of prices of lumber, wood products and other building products, (2) the cyclical nature of the
homebuilding industry, (3) general economic conditions in the various areas that we serve, (4) the intense
competition in the industry including expansion and growth strategies by competitors, (5) the production
schedules of our customers, and (6) the effects of the weather. These factors, among others, make it difficult to
project our operating results on a consistent basis.

**We may be adversely affected by any disruption in our respective information technology systems.**

Our operations are dependent upon our information technology systems, which encompass all of our major
business functions. Our ProBuild subsidiary currently maintains multiple enterprise resource planning (“ERP”)
systems to manage its operations. We plan to integrate ProBuild’s systems with ours over time and have
commenced that process. We may encounter significant operational disruptions and higher than expected costs in
connection with such integration process, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
operating results and cash flows. Our primary ERP system is a proprietary system that has been highly
customized by our computer programmers. Our centralized financial reporting system currently draws data from
our ERP systems. We rely upon our information technology systems to manage and replenish inventory, to fill
and ship customer orders on a timely basis, and to coordinate our sales activities across all of our products and
services. A substantial disruption in our information technology systems for any prolonged time period (arising
from, for example, system capacity limits from unexpected increases in our volume of business, outages, or

21


-----

delays in our service) could result in delays in receiving inventory and supplies or filling customer orders and
adversely affect our customer service and relationships. Our systems might be damaged or interrupted by natural
or man-made events or by computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar disruptions affecting the
global Internet. There can be no assurance that such delays, problems, or associated costs will not have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

**We may be adversely affected by any natural or man-made disruptions to our distribution and**
**manufacturing facilities.**

We currently maintain a broad network of distribution and manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. Any
widespread disruption to our facilities resulting from fire, earthquake, weather-related events, an act of terrorism
or any other cause could damage a significant portion of our inventory and could materially impair our ability to
distribute our products to customers. Moreover, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times
associated with distributing our products to our customers during the time that it takes for us to reopen or replace
a damaged facility. In addition, any shortages of fuel or significant fuel cost increases could disrupt our ability to
distribute products to our customers. If any of these events were to occur, our financial condition, operating
results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

**We may be unable to successfully implement our growth strategy, which includes increasing sales of our**
**prefabricated components and other value-added products, pursuing strategic acquisitions, opening new**
**facilities and delivering.**

Our long-term strategy depends in part on growing our sales of prefabricated components and other valueadded products and increasing our market share. If any of these initiatives are not successful, or require extensive
investment, our growth may be limited, and we may be unable to achieve or maintain expected levels of growth
and profitability.

Our long-term business plan also provides for continued growth through strategic acquisitions and organic
growth through the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities. Failure to identify and
acquire suitable acquisition candidates on appropriate terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth
strategy. Moreover, reduced operating results during the current slow economic recovery, our liquidity position,
or the requirements of the Indenture, the ABL Facility, the First-Lien Facility or the Existing Unsecured
Indenture, could prevent us from obtaining the capital required to effect new acquisitions or expansions of
existing facilities. Our failure to make successful acquisitions or to build or expand facilities, including
manufacturing facilities, produce saleable product, or meet customer demand in a timely manner could result in
damage to or loss of customer relationships, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating
results, and cash flows. A negative impact on our financial condition, operations results and cash flows, or our
decision to invest in strategic acquisitions or new facilities, could adversely affect our ability to delever.

In addition, although we have been successful in the past in integrating 33 acquisitions, we may not be able
to integrate the operations of ProBuild or any future acquired businesses with our own in an efficient and costeffective manner or without significant disruption to our or ProBuild’s existing operations. Moreover,
acquisitions, including the ProBuild acquisition, involve significant risks and uncertainties, including
uncertainties as to the future financial performance of the acquired business, the achievement of expected
synergies, difficulties integrating acquired personnel and corporate cultures into our business, the potential loss
of key employees, customers or suppliers, difficulties in integrating different computer and accounting systems,
exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies and the diversion of management attention and
resources from existing operations. We may be unable to successfully complete potential acquisitions due to
multiple factors, such as issues related to regulatory review of the proposed transactions. We may also be
required to incur additional debt in order to consummate acquisitions in the future, which debt may be substantial
and may limit our flexibility in using our cash flow from operations. Our failure to integrate ProBuild’s business
or future acquired businesses effectively or to manage other consequences of our acquisitions, including
increased indebtedness, could prevent us from remaining competitive and, ultimately, could adversely affect our
financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

22


-----

**Federal, state, local and other regulations could impose substantial costs and/or restrictions on our**
**operations that would reduce our net income.**

We are subject to various federal, state, local and other regulations, including, among other things,
regulations promulgated by the Department of Transportation and applicable to our fleet of delivery trucks, work
safety regulations promulgated by the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration,
employment regulations promulgated by the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,
accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or similar entities and state
and local zoning restrictions and building codes. More burdensome regulatory requirements in these or other
areas may increase our general and administrative costs and adversely affect our financial condition, operating
results and cash flows. Moreover, failure to comply with the regulatory requirements applicable to our business
could expose us to substantial penalties that could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and
cash flows.

**We are subject to potential exposure to environmental liabilities and are subject to environmental**
**regulation.**

We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations. Although
we believe that our facilities are in material compliance with such laws, ordinances, and regulations, as owners
and lessees of real property, we can be held liable for the investigation or remediation of contamination on such
properties, in some circumstances, without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for such
contamination. No assurance can be provided that remediation may not be required in the future as a result of
spills or releases of petroleum products or hazardous substances, the discovery of unknown environmental
conditions, more stringent standards regarding existing residual contamination, or changes in legislation, laws,
rules or regulations. More burdensome environmental regulatory requirements may increase our general and
administrative costs and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

**We may be adversely affected by uncertainty in the economy and financial markets, including as a result**
**of terrorism or unrest in the Middle East, Europe or elsewhere.**

Instability in the economy and financial markets, including as a result of terrorism or unrest in the Middle
East, Europe or elsewhere, may result in a decrease in housing starts, which would adversely affect our business.
In addition, such unrest or related adverse developments, including a retaliatory military strike or terrorist attack,
may cause unpredictable or unfavorable economic conditions and could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. Any shortages of fuel or significant fuel cost increases
related to geopolitical conditions could seriously disrupt our ability to distribute products to our customers. In
addition, domestic terrorist attacks may affect our ability to keep our operations and services functioning
properly and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

**Combining the operations of the Issuer and ProBuild may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than**
**expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the ProBuild acquisition may not be realized.**

We continue to assess synergies that we may realize as a consolidated company as a result of the ProBuild
acquisition, the realization of which will depend on a number of factors. The success of the ProBuild acquisition,
including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and
integrate the two businesses. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees,
higher than expected costs, diversion of management attention, the disruption of our ongoing businesses or
inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain
relationships with customers, suppliers, vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost
savings of the ProBuild acquisition. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, or if our operating
or financial performance is less than we expect, the anticipated benefits of the ProBuild acquisition may not be
realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Management continues to refine its
integration plan. The integration planning and implementation process has resulted and will continue to result in
significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources. The integration process could have an

23


-----

adverse effect on us for an undetermined period. In addition, the actual cost savings of the ProBuild acquisition
could be less than anticipated.

**The acquisition and integration of ProBuild may not achieve its intended results, including anticipated**
**synergies.**

While we expect the acquisition and integration of ProBuild to result in a significant amount of synergies
and other financial and operational benefits, we may be unable to realize these synergies or other benefits in the
timeframe that we expect or at all. Achieving the anticipated benefits, including synergies, is subject to a number
of uncertainties, including whether the businesses acquired can be operated in the manner we intend and whether
our costs to finance the ProBuild acquisition and integrate the businesses will be consistent with our
expectations. Events outside of our control, including, but not limited to, any conditions imposed by
governmental authorities, operating changes or regulatory changes, could also adversely affect our ability to
realize the anticipated benefits from the ProBuild acquisition. Thus, the integration may be unpredictable, or
subject to delays or changed circumstances, and our combined company may not perform in accordance with our
expectations. Further, we have and will continue to incur implementation costs relative to these anticipated
synergies, and our expectations with respect to integration or synergies as a result of the ProBuild acquisition
may not materialize. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on our anticipated synergies. See “—
Combining the operations of the Issuer and ProBuild may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than
expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the ProBuild acquisition may not be realized.” and “—
The integration of ProBuild involves substantial costs.”

**In connection with the ProBuild acquisition, we incurred significant additional indebtedness which could**
**adversely affect us, including by decreasing our business flexibility, and increased our interest expense.**

Our consolidated indebtedness as of June 30, 2016 was approximately $1,978.9 million. We substantially
increased our indebtedness in connection with the ProBuild acquisition, which has increased our interest expense
and could have the effect of, among other things, reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and
economic conditions.

The amount of cash required to pay interest on our increased indebtedness levels following the ProBuild
acquisition, and thus the demands on our cash resources, is substantially greater than the amount of cash flows
required to service our indebtedness prior to the ProBuild acquisition. The increased levels of indebtedness could
also reduce funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate
purposes and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels. If
we do not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the ProBuild acquisition, or if our financial
performance does not meet current expectations, then our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely
impacted.

Moreover, we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital, capital
expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements. Our ability to arrange additional financing or
refinancing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing
market conditions and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain
additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all.

**The integration of ProBuild involves substantial costs.**

We are incurring substantial fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans,
including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. We estimate these integrationrelated costs in the range of $90 to $100 million over the two years following the closing of the ProBuild
acquisition. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be
incurred in connection with the integration our and ProBuild’s businesses. Although we expect that the
elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the
businesses, should allow us to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in
the near term, or at all.

24


-----

**Uncertainties associated with the ProBuild acquisition may cause a loss of management and sales**
**personnel and other key employees of ProBuild or us, which could adversely affect our future business and**
**operations.**

We are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our senior management team and other key
employees to execute our business plans. Our success will depend in part upon its ability to retain key
management and sales personnel and other key employees. Current and prospective employees may experience
uncertainty about their future roles, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key
personnel. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be able to retain key management and sales
personnel and other key employees.

**Some ProBuild Employees are Unionized**

Approximately 2% of the workforce at ProBuild are members of nine different unions. Prior to the
acquisition of ProBuild, none of the workforce at the Issuer was unionized. There can be no assurance that
additional employees of the combined company will not conduct union organization campaigns or become union
members in the future.

**Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes**

**Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt and enter into**
**other transactions which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.**

We may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Indenture, the
Existing Unsecured Indenture, the credit agreements that govern our ABL Facility and First-Lien Facility and the
applicable agreements governing our other debt instruments contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional
indebtedness and entering into certain types of other transactions, these restrictions are subject to a number of
qualifications and exceptions. Additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be
substantial. These restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations, such as trade payables, that do
not constitute indebtedness as defined under our debt instruments. To the extent new debt is added to our current
debt levels, the substantial leverage risks described in the immediately preceding risk factor would increase.

**Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our indebtedness service**
**obligations to increase significantly.**

Interest rates may increase in the future. As a result, interest rates on our ABL Facility and First-Lien
Facility or other variable rate debt offerings could be higher or lower than current levels. As of June 30, 2016, we
had approximately $699.9 million, or 35.4%, of our outstanding debt, at variable interest rates. If interest rates
increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount
borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our
indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease.

**We may be unable to service our indebtedness, including the notes.**

Our ability to make scheduled payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the notes, depends
on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional
economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors beyond our control, including the availability of
financing in the international banking and capital markets. We cannot assure you that our business will generate
sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to
enable us to service our debt, including the notes, to refinance our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs.
Substantially all of our other debt, including the Existing Unsecured Notes, the ABL Facility and the First-Lien
Facility, will mature before the maturity date of the notes.

25


-----

If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to
restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the notes, which could cause us to default on our
debt obligations and impair our liquidity. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the
condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our indebtedness
could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further
restrict our business operations.

Moreover, in the event of a default, the holders of our indebtedness, including the notes, could elect to
declare all the funds borrowed to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. The lenders
under our ABL Facility or First-Lien Facility could also elect to terminate their commitments thereunder and
cease making further loans, such lenders could institute foreclosure proceedings against their collateral and we
could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If we breach our covenants under the credit agreements governing
our ABL Facility and First-Lien Facility or the Existing Unsecured Indenture, we would be in default thereunder.
Such lenders and holders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy
or liquidation.

**Claims of holders of the notes will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of certain of our**
**subsidiaries that will not guarantee the notes.**

The Issuer and each of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that guarantees the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will
initially guarantee the notes. The notes will not be guaranteed by certain of our existing and future subsidiaries.
Claims of holders of the notes will be structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors of these non-guarantor
subsidiaries, including trade creditors, and will not be satisfied from the assets of these non-guarantor
subsidiaries until their creditors are paid in full. In addition, the guarantee of a guarantor will be released in
connection with a transfer of such guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the Indenture or upon certain other
events described in “Description of the Notes—Guarantees.”

For the LTM ended June 30, 2016, those subsidiaries of the Issuer that will not serve as guarantors
accounted for a de minimis percentage of their respective parent’s sales, Adjusted EBITDA, total assets and total
liabilities.

The Indenture will, subject to some limitations, permit these non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur additional
debt and will not limit their ability to incur other liabilities that are not considered indebtedness under the
Indenture, such as trade payables.

**The Indenture will impose, and the credit agreements that govern our ABL Facility and First-Lien Facility**
**and the Existing Unsecured Indenture currently impose, significant operating and financial restrictions on**
**us and our subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities.**

The Indenture will impose, and the credit agreements that govern our ABL Facility and First-Lien Facility
and the Existing Unsecured Indenture currently impose, significant operating and financial restrictions on us.
These restrictions will limit the Issuer’s ability and the ability of the Issuer’s restricted subsidiaries to, among
other things:

   - incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;

   - pay dividends and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock;

   - make certain investments;

   - incur certain liens;

   - enter into transactions with affiliates;

   - merge or consolidate;

26


-----

   - enter into agreements that restrict the ability of the Issuers’ restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or
other payments to the Issuers;

   - designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and

   - transfer or sell assets.

In addition, the ABL Facility requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio if availability
under our ABL Facility falls below a certain threshold.

As a result of these restrictions, we will be limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable
to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business
opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We
cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to
do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.

Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as other terms of our
indebtedness and/or the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could result in an event of default,
which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date.
If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these borrowings, our
results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

**Our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, including as a result**
**of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect**
**our results of operations and our financial condition.**

If there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our indebtedness, the holders of the
defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately.
We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flows would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our
outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance
or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt, the holders of such debt could proceed against the
collateral securing that indebtedness. In addition, any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one
debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments.

**Repayment of our debt, including required principal and interest payments on the notes, is dependent on**
**cash flow generated by our subsidiaries, which may be subject to limitations beyond our control.**

We are a holding company that derives all of our operating income from our subsidiaries. All of our assets
are held by our direct and indirect subsidiaries. We rely on the earnings and cash flows of our subsidiaries, which
are paid to us by our subsidiaries in the form of dividends and other payments or distributions, to meet our debt
service obligations.

Unless they are guarantors of the notes, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on
the notes or to make funds available to the Issuer for that purpose. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries may not be
able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our
indebtedness, including the notes. Each non-guarantor subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain
circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our non-guarantor
subsidiaries. While limitations on our subsidiaries restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other
intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. The Indenture
will not limit the ability of our non-guarantor unrestricted subsidiaries to incur any additional consensual
restrictions on their ability to make any such payments to us.

In the event that we are unable to receive distributions from subsidiaries, we may be unable to make
required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the notes.

27


-----

**Federal and state statutes allow courts, under specific circumstances, to void notes and require note**
**holders to return payments received.**

If we become a debtor in a case under the Bankruptcy Code or encounter other financial difficulty under
federal or state fraudulent transfer law a court may void or otherwise decline to enforce the notes. A court might
do so if it found that when we issued the notes, or in some states when payments became due under the notes, we
received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration and:

   - were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;

   - were left with inadequate capital to conduct its business;

   - believed or reasonably should have believed that we would incur debts beyond our ability to pay; or

   - were a defendant in an action for money damages or had a judgment for money damages docketed against
us if, in either case, the judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment.

The court might also void an issuance of notes, without regard to the above factors, if the court found that
we issued the notes with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its creditors.

A court would likely find that we did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the
notes if we did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes. Because we are
using the proceeds to pay a dividend or distribution to our equityholders, a court could conclude that we did not
receive reasonably equivalent value. If a court were to void the issuance of the notes you would no longer have
any claim against the Issuers. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources,
including the remaining obligors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you
already received from us. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, you may not
receive any repayment on the notes. Further, the avoidance of the notes could result in an event of default with
respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other debt, which could result in acceleration of that debt. The measures of
insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws will vary depending upon the law applied in any
proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, we would be considered
insolvent if:

   - the sum of our debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of our
assets;

   - if the present fair saleable value of our assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay our
probable liability on our existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and
mature; or

   - we could not pay our debts as they become due.

On the basis of historical financial information, recent operating history and other factors, we believe that
we, after giving effect to these notes, will not be insolvent, will not have unreasonably small capital for the
business in which we are engaged and will not have incurred debts beyond our ability to pay such debts as they
mature. In addition, we are not a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for money
damages docketed against us, for which the judgment was unsatisfied after final judgment. We cannot assure
you, however, as to what standard a court would apply in making these determinations or that a court would
agree with our conclusions in this regard.

Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the notes to other
claims against us under the principle of equitable subordination if the court determines that (a) the holder of notes
engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (b) the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors
or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of notes and (c) equitable subordination is not inconsistent
with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

**We can enter into transactions like recapitalizations, reorganizations and other highly leveraged**
**transactions that do not constitute a change of control but that could adversely affect the holders of the**
**notes.**

Certain important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations, may not, under the Indenture,
constitute a “change of control” that would require us to repurchase the notes, notwithstanding the fact that such
corporate events could increase the level of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure,
credit ratings or the value of the notes. Therefore, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions,
including acquisitions, reorganizations, refinancings or other recapitalizations, which would not constitute a
change of control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such
time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings.

**Holders of notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have**
**the notes repurchased has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of our assets.**

The definition of change of control in the Indenture includes a phrase relating to the sale of “all or
substantially all” of our assets. There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under
applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of notes to require us to repurchase its notes as a result of a
sale of less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain. See “Description of the Notes—Change of
Control.”

**Holders of the notes will not be entitled to registration rights and we do not currently intend to register the**
**notes under applicable securities laws, and there are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the**
**notes.**

The notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws and we do not currently intend to register the notes or to offer to exchange the
notes for notes registered under the Securities Act. The holders of the notes will not be entitled to require us to
register the notes for resale or otherwise. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes in the United States only
in a transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment in the notes for an
indefinite period of time. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**An active trading market may not develop for the notes.**

We cannot assure you that an active trading market will develop for the notes. We do not intend to apply for
listing of the notes on any securities exchange or on any automated dealer quotation system in the United States.
Although we have been informed by the initial purchasers that they currently intend to make a market for the
notes, they are not obliged to do so and any market making may be discontinued at any time without notice.

The liquidity of, and trading market for, the notes may also be adversely affected by, among other things:

   - changes in the overall market for securities similar to the notes;

   - changes in our financial performance or prospects;

   - the prospects for companies in our industry generally;

   - the number of holders of the notes;

   - the interest of securities dealers in making a market for the notes;

   - the conditions of the financial markets; and

   - prevailing interest rates.

29


-----

The condition of the financial markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are likely
to fluctuate in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the market prices of the notes.

We are offering these notes in reliance upon an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws. Therefore, the notes may be transferred or resold only in a transaction registered
under or exempt from the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. Historically, the market for noninvestment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of
securities that are similar to the notes. We cannot assure you that the market, if any, for any of the notes will be
free from similar disruptions or that any such disruptions may not adversely affect the prices at which you may
sell your notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the notes may trade at a discount from their initial
offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our performance, and other
factors.

**A lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may adversely**
**affect the market price or liquidity of the notes.**

The notes offered hereby will have a non-investment grade rating. There can be no assurances that such
rating will remain for any given period of time or that such rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a
rating agency if, in that rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as
adverse changes, so warrant. Credit ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold or sell the notes, and may
be revised or withdrawn at any time. Additionally, credit ratings may not reflect the potential effect of risks
relating to the structure or marketing of the notes. If the credit rating of the notes is subsequently lowered or
withdrawn for any reason, you may not be able to resell your notes without a substantial discount.

**During any period in which the notes are rated investment grade, certain covenants contained in the**
**Indenture will not be applicable and the guarantees may be released; however, there is no assurance that**
**the notes will be rated investment grade.**

The Indenture will provide that certain covenants will be suspended and the guarantees may be released if
the notes are rated investment grade by two of Standard & Poor’s Investors Ratings Service, Moody’s Investors
Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings, Inc. and no default or event of default has otherwise occurred and is continuing
under the Indenture. If the notes are subsequently downgraded below investment grade, such covenants and such
guarantees will be reinstated. The covenants that would be suspended include, among others, limitations on our
and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends, make restricted payments, incur indebtedness, sell
certain assets and enter into certain other transactions. Any actions that we take while these covenants are not in
force will be permitted even if the covenants are subsequently reinstated. There can be no assurance that the
notes will ever be rated investment grade, or that if they are rated investment grade, the notes will maintain such
ratings. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of
Investment Grade Status.”

**The notes will be effectively subordinated to the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ indebtedness under the ABL**
**Facility and our other secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such**
**indebtedness on a basis senior to the notes.**

The ABL Facility will be secured by a first-priority lien on the ABL Collateral, subject to certain exceptions
and permitted liens. In addition, the Indenture will, subject to certain limitations, permit us to incur additional
indebtedness secured on a basis prior to the notes by the ABL Collateral in the future. The borrowings under our
ABL Facility and any such future indebtedness will be higher in priority as to the ABL Collateral than the
security interests on the ABL Collateral securing the notes and the guarantees. In addition, we may incur certain
other indebtedness that is secured by permitted liens on assets that do not constitute a part of the Collateral.

The notes and the guarantees will be secured by a second-priority lien, subject to certain exceptions and
permitted liens, on the ABL Collateral. Holders of the indebtedness under the ABL Facility and holders of any

30


-----

other indebtedness secured by a prior lien on the ABL Collateral, creditors holding permitted liens which rank
prior to the noteholders on the Notes Collateral and holders of any indebtedness secured by permitted liens on
assets not constituting a part of the Collateral will be entitled to receive proceeds from the realization of value of
the assets securing such indebtedness to repay such indebtedness in full before the holders of the notes will be
entitled to any recovery from such assets. Accordingly, holders of the notes will only be entitled to receive
proceeds from the realization of the value of the ABL Collateral after all indebtedness and other obligations
under the ABL Facility and any other obligations secured by prior liens on the ABL Collateral are repaid in full.
As a result, the notes will be effectively junior in right of payment to such indebtedness under the ABL Facility
and such other secured indebtedness, to the extent of the realizable value of the assets securing such indebtedness
on a basis senior to the notes.

**The ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement will limit the rights of holders of the notes with respect to certain**
**Collateral, even during an event of default.**

The rights of the holders of the notes with respect to the ABL Collateral will be substantially limited by the
terms of the ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement, even during an event of default. Under the ABL-Notes
Intercreditor Agreement, at any time that obligations that are secured by first-priority liens on the ABL
Collateral, or commitments in respect of such obligations, are outstanding, any actions that may be taken in
respect of such ABL Collateral, including the commencement of enforcement proceedings against such ABL
Collateral and the control of the conduct of such proceedings, and the release of liens on such ABL Collateral
will be at the direction of the holders of the obligations secured by the first-priority liens, and the holders of the
Notes, which are secured by second-priority liens on the ABL Collateral, may be adversely affected. See
“Description of the Notes—Security—Notes Collateral” and “Description of the Notes—ABL-Notes
Intercreditor Agreement.”

In addition, because the holders of the indebtedness secured by first-priority liens on the ABL Collateral
control the disposition of the ABL Collateral, such holders could decide not to proceed against the ABL
Collateral, regardless of whether there is a default under the documents governing such indebtedness or under the
Indenture. In such event, although the holders of the notes may seek to foreclose on the Notes Collateral, such
holders will not be able to foreclose on the ABL Collateral and the only remedy available to the holders of the
notes in respect of the ABL Collateral would be to sue for payment on the notes and the guarantees. The ABLNotes Intercreditor Agreement will contain certain other provisions benefiting the holders of the indebtedness
under the ABL Facility, including provisions prohibiting the Notes Collateral Agent from objecting, following
the filing of a bankruptcy petition, to a number of important matters regarding the ABL Collateral or to certain
financings to be provided to us. After such filing, the value of the ABL Collateral could materially deteriorate
and holders of the notes would be unable to raise an objection. In addition, the right of the holders of obligations
secured by first-priority liens to foreclose upon and sell Collateral upon the occurrence of an event of default also
would be subject to limitations under applicable bankruptcy laws if we or any of our subsidiaries become subject
to a bankruptcy proceeding. See “Description of the Notes—ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement.”

**The Notes Collateral Agent May Cease to be the Controlling Collateral Agent under the Pari Passu**
**Intercreditor Agreement**

The rights of the holders of the notes with respect to the Collateral that will secure the notes will be subject
to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. Under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement any actions that may be
taken with respect to Collateral, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings
against such Collateral or to control such proceedings, will be initially at the direction of the Notes Collateral
Agent until (x) the obligations under the notes do not represent the largest class of indebtedness having Pari
Passu Lien Priority (as defined under “Description of the Notes”) (determined based on the aggregate principal
amount of such indebtedness then outstanding or the aggregate accreted amount of such indebtedness with
respect to any such indebtedness issued at a discount) or (ii) 90 days after the occurrence of an event of default
under the agreement governing and acceleration of the series of obligations representing the largest outstanding

31


-----

principal amount of indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority (other than the obligations under the notes) and
applicable notice from the collateral agent with respect to such obligations; provided that such 90-day period
shall be stayed with respect to any Collateral if the Notes Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently
pursuing an enforcement action with respect to such Collateral or the grantor of the security interest in such
Collateral (whether our company or the applicable subsidiary guarantor) is then a debtor under or with respect to
(or otherwise subject to) an insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

If we issue additional first lien notes or other debt in the future in a greater principal amount than the notes,
then the authorized representative for those additional notes or other debt will become the controlling collateral
agent under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement and will be entitled to exercise rights under the Pari Passu
Intercreditor Agreement, rather than the Notes Collateral Agent.

**The Collateral may not be valuable enough to satisfy all the obligations secured by such Collateral.**

The notes, guarantees and the obligations under the First-Lien Facility will be secured on a pari passu basis
by substantially all the assets of the Issuer and the guarantors, including stock of certain of their subsidiaries
(subject to certain limitations), but specifically excluding certain types of assets. See “Description of the Notes—
Security—Notes Collateral” and “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions—Excluded Assets.” Other
liabilities, including certain debt, can also be secured by the same Collateral to the extent permitted by the
indenture.

No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this offering, and we cannot
assure you that the value of the Collateral is equal to or greater than our obligations with respect to the notes, the
ABL Facility and the First-Lien Facility. In addition, the fair market value of the Collateral is subject to
fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, general economic conditions. The amount to be received
upon a sale of the Collateral would be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual
fair market value of the Collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of the sale and the availability of
buyers. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be
substantial delays in its liquidation. The Indenture will allow us to incur additional secured debt, including under
certain circumstances, secured debt that will share in the Collateral that will secure the notes and the guarantees.
Accordingly, in the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the Collateral may not
be sold in a timely or orderly manner, and the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral may not be
sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ obligations under the notes, the guarantees, the ABL Facility,
the First-Lien Facility and any future debt that is secured by the Collateral.

To the extent that pre-existing liens, liens permitted under the Indenture and other rights, including liens on
excluded assets, such as those securing certain purchase money obligations and capital lease obligations granted
to other parties (in addition to the holders of obligations secured by first-priority liens), encumber any of the
Collateral, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that could
adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent or the holders of the
notes to realize or foreclose on the Collateral.

The security interests in the Collateral also will be subject to practical problems generally associated with
the realization of security interests in Collateral. For example, the consent of a third-party may be required to
obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract. We cannot assure you that any such consent could be obtained.
We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when and if required to facilitate a
foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Notes Collateral Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon
those assets and the value of the Collateral may be significantly impaired. In addition, our business requires
compliance with numerous U.S. federal, state, provincial and local license and permit requirements. Continued
operation of our properties that are part of the Collateral will depend on the continued compliance with such
license and permit requirements to the extent applicable, and our business and the value of the Collateral may be
adversely affected if we fail to comply with these requirements or changes in these requirements. In the event of

32


-----

foreclosure, the transfer of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or may require us to incur significant
cost and expense. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that the applicable governmental authorities will consent to
the transfer of all such permits. If the regulatory approvals required for such transfers are not obtained or are
delayed, the foreclosure may be delayed, our operations may be shut down and the value of the Collateral may be
significantly impaired.

In addition, the Indenture permits us, subject to certain conditions, to issue additional secured debt,
including debt secured equally and ratably with the noteholders on the Collateral. This would reduce amounts
payable to holders of the Notes from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral.

There may not be sufficient Collateral to pay off any amounts we may borrow under the ABL Facility, the
notes, the First-Lien Facility and any other secured indebtedness we incur that ranks pari passu with or prior to
the notes.

Consequently, liquidating the Collateral may not result in proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any
amounts due under the notes and the First-Lien Facility after satisfying the obligations to pay any creditors with
prior liens. If the proceeds of the sale of the Notes Collateral and the ABL Collateral (subject to prior discharge
of obligations under the ABL Facility) are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the notes and the First-Lien
Facility, the holders of the notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would
have only an unsecured claim against our and the guarantors’ remaining assets, which may not be sufficient to
repay our obligations under the notes.

Also, certain permitted liens on the Collateral securing the notes may allow the holder of such lien to
exercise rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral subject to such lien that could adversely affect the
value of such Collateral and the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose upon such Collateral.

**We will, in most cases, have control over the Notes Collateral, and the sale or pledge of particular assets by**
**us could reduce the pool of assets securing the notes and the guarantees.**

The security documents related to the notes generally allow us to remain in possession of, retain exclusive
control over, freely operate, dispose of and collect, invest and dispose of any income from, the Notes Collateral,
with certain limited exceptions. Therefore, the pool of assets securing the notes and the guarantees and any other
debt similarly secured will change from time to time, and its fair market value may decrease from its value on the
date the notes are originally issued. In addition, we will not be required to comply with all or any portion of the
Trust Indenture Act of 1939, including, among others, Section 314(d) thereof. Section 314(d) would otherwise
have required certain appraisal and valuation actions in connection with certain releases of Collateral under the
security documents.

**There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the notes under which the Collateral**
**securing the notes and the guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent**
**of the trustee.**

Under various circumstances, all or a portion of the Collateral may be released, including:

   - to enable the disposition of such Collateral (other than to the Issuer or a guarantor) to the extent not
prohibited under the Indenture;

   - with respect to Collateral held by a guarantor, upon the release of such guarantor from its guarantee;

   - to the extent such Collateral is comprised of property leased to the Issuer or a guarantor, upon termination
or expiration of such lease; and

   - in connection with an amendment to the Indenture or the related security documents that has received the
required consent.

33


-----

The guarantees may be released if the notes are rated investment grade; provided, however, that if the notes
are subsequently downgraded below investment grade the guarantees may be reinstated. See “Description of the
Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.”

In addition, the guarantee of a guarantor will be released in connection with a sale of such guarantor in a
transaction not prohibited by the Indenture.

The Indenture will also permit us to designate one or more of our restricted subsidiaries that is a guarantor
of the notes as an unrestricted subsidiary. If we designate a guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary, all of the liens
on any Collateral owned by such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries and any guarantees of the notes by such
subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries will be released under the Indenture. Designation of a guarantor as an
unrestricted subsidiary will reduce the aggregate value of the Collateral securing the notes to the extent that liens
on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries are released. In addition, the creditors of any
unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have a senior claim on the assets of such unrestricted subsidiary
and its subsidiaries. See “Description of the Notes.”

**There are certain categories of property that are excluded from the Collateral.**

Certain categories of assets are excluded from the Collateral. Excluded assets include, among other things,
property and assets the pledge of which would violate applicable law, certain licenses, contracts and agreements
containing terms prohibiting assignment, certain fee-owned real property interests, including fee-owned real
property with a fair market value of less than $3.5 million, all real property leasehold interests, all rolling stock,
the assets of our non-guarantor subsidiaries and certain capital stock and other securities of our subsidiaries. As
of the date of this offering circular, none of our owned real property met the threshold to be included in the
Collateral. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions—Excluded Assets.” Moreover, we will not be
required to add any asset to the Collateral if we determine in consultation with the administrative agent under the
ABL Facility or the administrative agent under the First-Lien Facility that the cost of taking a lien on such asset
is excessive in relation to the benefit to be afforded by such lien. See “Description of the Notes—Security—
Notes Collateral.” If an event of default occurs and the notes are accelerated, holders of the notes and the
guarantees will rank equally with the holders of other unsubordinated and unsecured indebtedness of the relevant
entity with respect to such excluded assets and junior to holders of indebtedness secured by a lien on such
excluded assets.

**Rights of holders of the notes in the Collateral maybe adversely affected by the failure to perfect security**
**interests in the Collateral. We will not be required to perfect the security interest over certain Collateral.**

Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. The liens on the
Collateral securing the notes and the guarantees may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the notes and
the guarantees if the Notes Collateral Agent is not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens.
Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent has an obligation to perfect or maintain the perfection of the
security interest in the Collateral. If a security interest is not perfected with respect to any portion of the
Collateral, the notes and the guarantees may not be effectively secured by such Collateral.

In addition, applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general
security interest, such as real property, equipment subject to a certificate of title, certain proceeds and other
assets, can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. The Issuer and the
guarantors have limited obligations to perfect the security interest for the benefit of the holders of the notes in
specified Collateral. We cannot assure you that despite our obligation to do so under the Indenture, we will
inform the trustee or Notes Collateral Agent of the future acquisition of assets and rights that constitute
Collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such afteracquired Collateral. Neither the trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent has an obligation to monitor the

34


-----

acquisition of additional assets or rights that constitute Collateral or perfect or monitor the perfection of any
security interest. Such failure to monitor may result in the loss of the security interest in the Collateral or the
priority of the security interest in favor of the notes and the guarantees against third parties. Furthermore, certain
actions are required to be taken periodically to maintain certain security interests granted in the Collateral, and a
failure to do so may result in the loss of the security interest in the Collateral or the priority of the security
interest in favor of the notes and the guarantees, in each case, against third parties.

In addition, in certain jurisdictions, security interests created over particular assets can only be perfected by
possession of the asset by the secured party. The terms of the security documents may not require possession to
be granted to the secured party, meaning that the security interest will remain unperfected until possession is
granted.

Moreover, the Indenture and the security documents will not require us to take any perfection actions with
respect to motor vehicles and other assets subject to certificates of title, certain governmental receivables, certain
commercial tort claims and certain promissory notes. See “Description of the Notes—Security—Limitation on
Certain Collateral and Perfection Items.”

Our failure to meet our obligations to inform the trustee or the collateral agent of the future acquisition of
assets or rights that constitute collateral may constitute a breach under the Indenture, which may result in the
acceleration of our obligations under the notes. However, acceleration of such obligations in such situation may
not provide an adequate remedy to you if the value of the collateral is impaired by the failure to perfect the
security interest in, or create a valid lien with respect to, such after-acquired collateral.

**Any future grant of a security interest in Collateral or guarantee in favor of the holders of the notes might**
**be voidable in bankruptcy.**

Any future grant of a security interest in Collateral or guarantee in favor of the holders of the notes might be
voidable in a bankruptcy case of the grantor or guarantor if certain events or circumstances exist or occur,
including if the grantor or guarantor is insolvent at the time of the grant or guarantee, the grant or guarantee
enables the holders of the notes to receive more than they would if the grant or guarantee had not been made and
the debtor were liquidated under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”), and a
bankruptcy case in respect of the grantor or guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the grant or
guarantee (or one year before commencement of a bankruptcy case if the creditor that benefited from the lien or
guarantee is an “insider” under the Bankruptcy Code).

**The Collateral is subject to casualty risks, which may limit your ability to recover as a secured creditor for**
**losses to the Collateral, and which may have an adverse impact on our operations and results.**

We intend to maintain insurance or otherwise insure against hazards in a manner appropriate and customary
for our business. There are, however, certain losses, including losses resulting from terrorist acts, with respect to
the Collateral that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, in whole or part. Insurance proceeds
may not compensate us fully for our losses. If there is a complete or partial loss of any Collateral, the insurance
proceeds may not be sufficient to satisfy all of our obligations, including the notes and the guarantees.

In the event of a total or partial loss affecting any of the Company’s facilities, certain items of equipment
and inventory may not be easily replaced. Accordingly, even though there may be insurance coverage, the
extended period needed to obtain replacement units or inventory may cause significant delays, which may have
an adverse impact on our operations and results. In addition, certain zoning laws and regulations may prevent
rebuilding substantially the same facilities in the event of a casualty, which may have an adverse impact on our
operations and results.

35


-----

**Bankruptcy laws may limit the ability of holders of the notes to realize value from the Collateral.**

The right of the Notes Collateral Agent to repossess and dispose of the Collateral upon the occurrence of an
event of default under the Indenture is likely to be significantly impaired by applicable bankruptcy law if a
bankruptcy case were to be commenced by or against the Issuer or any of the guarantors before the Notes
Collateral Agent repossesses and disposes of the Collateral. For example, under the Bankruptcy Code, pursuant
to the automatic stay imposed upon the bankruptcy filing, a secured creditor is prohibited from repossessing its
collateral from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of collateral repossessed from such debtor, or
taking other actions to levy against a debtor, without bankruptcy court approval after notice and a hearing.
Moreover, the Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral even though the
debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate
protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” is undefined in the Bankruptcy Code and may vary
according to circumstances (and is within the discretion of the bankruptcy court), but it is intended in general to
protect the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral from diminishing in value during the pending of the
bankruptcy case and may include periodic payments or the granting of additional security, if and at such times as
the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral as a result of the automatic
stay or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court
could conclude that the secured creditor’s interest in its collateral is “adequately protected” against any
diminution in value during the bankruptcy case without the need of providing any additional protection. Due to
the imposition of the automatic stay, the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the
broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict (i) how long payments under the
notes could be delayed or if they will be made at all, following commencement of a bankruptcy case, (ii) whether
or when the Notes Collateral Agent could repossess or dispose of the Collateral or (iii) whether or to what extent
holders of the notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral through the
requirement of “adequate protection.”

**The guarantees and security interests provided by the guarantors may not be enforceable and, under**
**specific circumstances, federal and state statutes may allow courts to void the guarantees and security**
**interests and require holders of notes to return payments received from guarantors.**

Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, a guarantee or
the grant of a security interest could be deemed a fraudulent transfer if the guarantor or grantor of such security
interest received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for giving the guarantee or granting the
security interest, and one of the following is also true:

   - such guarantor or grantor was insolvent on the date that it gave the guarantee or granted the security
interest or became insolvent as a result of giving the guarantee or granting the security interest; or

   - such guarantor or grantor was engaged in business or a transaction, or was about to engage in business or
a transaction, for which property remaining with the guarantor or grantor was an unreasonably small
capital; or

   - such guarantor or grantor intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts that would be beyond
the guarantor’s or grantor’s ability to pay as those debts matured.

A guarantee or the grant of a security interest could also be deemed a fraudulent transfer if it was given with
actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud any entity to which the guarantor or grantor was or became, on or after
the date the guarantee was given or the security interest was granted, indebted.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations will vary depending upon the law
applied in any proceeding with respect to the foregoing. Generally, however, a guarantor or grantor would be
considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:

   - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than all its assets, at a fair valuation; or

36


-----

   - the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and
mature; or

   - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

We cannot predict:

   - what standard a court would apply in order to determine whether a guarantor or grantor was insolvent as
of the date it issued a guarantee or granted a security interest, as applicable, or whether, regardless of the
method of valuation, a court would determine that the guarantor or grantor was insolvent on that date; or

   - whether a court would determine that the payments under a guarantee or the realization on collateral
would constitute fraudulent transfers or fraudulent conveyances on other grounds.

The Indenture will contain a “savings clause” intended to limit each guarantor’s liability under its guarantee
to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer under
applicable law. There can be no assurance that this provision will be upheld as intended. In 2009, the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of Florida in Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of TOUSA,
Inc. v. Citicorp N. Am., Inc. found this kind of provision in that case to be ineffective, and held the guarantees to
be fraudulent transfers and voided them in their entirety.

If a guarantee is deemed to be a fraudulent transfer, it could be voided altogether, or it could be
subordinated to all other debts of the guarantor. In such case, any payment by the guarantor pursuant to its
guarantee could be required to be returned to the guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the creditors of the
guarantor. If a guarantee is voided or held unenforceable for any other reason, holders of the notes would cease to
have a claim against the guarantor based on the guarantee and would be creditors only of the Issuer and any
guarantor whose guarantee was not similarly voided or otherwise held unenforceable.

**Security over certain collateral will not be in place by the closing date of the offering or may not be**
**perfected, or a valid lien may not be created, on the closing date of the offering or at all.**

Certain security interests that may secure the notes will not be in place by the closing date of the offering
and/or will not be perfected or have a valid lien created on the closing date of this offering, including, without
limitation, in respect of certain deposit accounts. To the extent any security interest in the collateral cannot be
perfected or a valid lien created with respect thereto on or prior to the closing date of this offering, we will agree
in the Indenture and the security documents to have all such security interests perfected or a valid lien created
promptly following the closing date of the offering, but in any event no later than 90 days after such date. We
cannot assure you that we will be able to perfect or create a valid lien with respect to any such security interests
on or prior to that date or at all, and our failure to do so will result in a default under the indenture. See
“Description of the Notes—Events of Default and Remedies.” If a security interest in certain collateral is
perfected or a valid lien created subsequent to the closing date of the offering, but within 90 days (or, in certain
circumstances, a period longer than 90 days) prior to a bankruptcy filing, then such security interest is at risk of
avoidance as a preferential transfer in the event of bankruptcy. If the grant of any such mortgage or other security
interest is avoided as a preference, you would lose the benefit of that mortgage or security interest.

**The notes could be wholly or partially voided as a preferential transfer.**

If we become the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding within 90 days after the date of the Indenture (or, with
respect to any insiders specified in bankruptcy law who are holders of the notes, within one year after we issue
the notes), and the court determines that we were insolvent at the time of the closing (under the preference laws,
we would be presumed to have been insolvent on and during the 90 days immediately preceding the date of filing

37


-----

of any bankruptcy petition), the court could find that the incurrence of the obligations under the notes involved a
preferential transfer. In addition, to the extent that certain of our collateral is not perfected until after closing,
such 90-day preferential transfer period would begin on the date of perfection. If the court determined that the
granting of the security interest was therefore a preferential transfer, which did not qualify for any defense under
bankruptcy law, then holders of the notes would be unsecured creditors with claims that ranked pari passu with
all other unsecured creditors of the applicable obligor, including trade creditors. In addition, under such
circumstances, the value of any consideration holders received pursuant to the notes, including upon foreclosure
of the collateral, could also be subject to recovery from such holders and possibly from subsequent assignees, or
such holders might be returned to the same position they held as holders of the notes.

**The waiver in the ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement of rights of marshaling may adversely affect the**
**recovery rates of holders of the notes in a bankruptcy or foreclosure scenario.**

The notes and the guarantees will be secured on a second-priority basis by the ABL Collateral. The ABLNotes Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, at any time holders of the notes hold a second-priority lien on
the ABL Collateral where a first-priority lien on such ABL Collateral exists, the trustee under the Indenture and
the Notes Collateral Agent may not assert or enforce any right of marshaling accorded to a junior lienholder, as
against the holders of such indebtedness secured by first-priority liens in the ABL Collateral. Without this waiver
of the right of marshaling, holders of such indebtedness secured by first-priority liens in the ABL Collateral
would likely be required to liquidate collateral on which the notes did not have a lien, if any, prior to liquidating
the ABL Collateral, thereby maximizing the proceeds of the Collateral that would be available to repay our
obligations under the notes. As a result of this waiver, the proceeds of sales of the ABL Collateral could be
applied to repay any indebtedness secured by first-priority liens in the ABL Collateral before applying proceeds
of other collateral securing indebtedness, and the holders of notes may recover less than they would have if such
proceeds were applied in the order most favorable to the holders of the notes.

**In the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuer or any of the guarantors, holders of the notes may be deemed to**
**have an unsecured claim to the extent that obligations in respect of the notes exceed the fair market value**
**of the Collateral securing the notes.**

In any bankruptcy proceeding under Title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, with respect to the Issuer or any of
the guarantors, it is possible that the bankruptcy trustee, the debtor-in-possession or competing creditors will
assert that the fair market value of the Collateral with respect to the notes on the date of the bankruptcy filing was
less than the then-current principal amount of the notes and all other obligations with equal and ratable security
interests in the Collateral. Upon a finding by the bankruptcy court that the notes are under-collateralized, the
claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the notes would be bifurcated between a secured claim and
an unsecured claim, and the unsecured claim would not be entitled to the benefits of security in the Collateral.
Other consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would be, among other things, a lack of entitlement on
the part of the holders of the notes to receive post-petition interest and a lack of entitlement on the part of the
unsecured portion of the notes to receive “adequate protection” under the Bankruptcy Code. In addition, if any
payments of post-petition interest had been made prior to the time of such a finding of undercollateralization,
those payments could be recharacterized by the bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of the
secured claim with respect to the notes.

**The use of a collateral agent may diminish the rights that a secured creditor would otherwise have with**
**respect to the Collateral.**

The security interest in the Collateral securing the notes will be taken in the name of the Notes Collateral
Agent for the benefit of the holders of the notes and the trustee. The Notes Collateral Agent will enter into each
security document on behalf of the noteholders. The Notes Collateral Agent may effect control actions with
respect to the Collateral (subject to the rights of the collateral agent for the ABL Facility with respect to the ABL
Collateral and the rights of the Term Collateral Agent under the First-Lien Facility or the future controlling

38


-----

collateral agent under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement), which may impair the rights that a noteholder
would otherwise have as a secured creditor. The Notes Collateral Agent may take actions that a noteholder
disagrees with or fail to take actions that a noteholder wishes to pursue. Furthermore, the Notes Collateral Agent
may fail to act in a timely manner, which could impair the recovery of noteholders.

In certain circumstances, the security agreements, the ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement and the Pari
Passu Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the collateral agent for the ABL Facility or the Term Collateral
Agent for the First-Lien Facility will act as bailee or agent on behalf of both the lenders under the ABL Facility
or the First-Lien Facility and the notes in respect of certain Collateral. In addition, the collateral agent for the
ABL Facility or the First-Lien Facility may be subject to conflicts of interest due to its role as bailee or agent on
behalf of competing classes of creditors. Moreover, the holders of the notes will have limited rights against the
collateral agent for the ABL Facility or the First-Lien Facility.

**Under local law, liens securing the notes and the guarantees may not have the priority described in this**
**offering circular and may rank junior, even with respect to Notes Collateral, to liens securing the ABL**
**Facility or the First-Lien Facility, and you must rely on the ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement and/or**
**the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement to ensure that enforcement proceeds of the Collateral are**
**allocated according to the priority described in this offering circular.**

Under local law, the security interests securing the notes and the guarantees may be subject to legal
doctrines that effectively rank them behind the security interests in favor of other obligations, including the
security interests in favor of the lenders under the ABL Facility or the First-Lien Facility. Therefore, the
allocation of enforcement proceeds of the Collateral depends on the enforceability of the ABL-Notes
Intercreditor Agreement and/or the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. As a result, if the ABL-Notes
Intercreditor Agreement and/or the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable for
any reason, or if an administrator, liquidator or similar officer appointed under the laws of any relevant
jurisdiction refuses to give effect to it, the notes may rank behind other outstanding secured indebtedness. In
addition, certain jurisdictions may provide certain creditors with priorities in payment in the event of a
guarantor’s bankruptcy.

**The notes may be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes.**

If the stated principal amount of the notes exceeds their issue price by an amount greater than or equal to a
statutorily-defined de minimis threshold, then the notes will be considered to be issued with OID for United
States federal income tax purposes. If the notes are issued with OID, then, in addition to the stated interest on a
note, a U.S. Holder (as defined in “Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations”) generally will be
required to include the OID on such note in gross income (as ordinary income) as it accrues on a constant yield
basis for United States federal income tax purposes, in advance of the receipt of the cash payments to which such
OID is attributable and regardless of the holder’s regular method of accounting for United States federal income
tax purposes. See “Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations.”

**We may not be able to satisfy our obligations to holders of the notes upon a change of control.**

Upon the occurrence of a “change of control,” as defined in the Indenture, each holder of the notes will have
the right to require the Issuer to purchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount thereof,
together with any accrued and unpaid interest. The Issuer’s failure to purchase, or to give notice of purchase of,
the notes would be a default under the Indenture, which would in turn be a default under the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities. In addition, a change of control may constitute an event of default under the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities. An event of default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities may result in an event of default
under the Indenture if the lenders accelerate the debt under either of the ABL Facility or the First-Lien Facility.
Any of our future debt agreements may contain similar provisions.

39


-----

If a change of control occurs, we may not have enough assets to satisfy all obligations under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities and the notes. Upon the occurrence of a change of control we could seek to refinance
the indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the notes or obtain a waiver from the lenders
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or the holders of the notes. We cannot assure you, however, that we
would be able to obtain a waiver or refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. No
assurances can be given that any court would enforce the change of control provisions in the indenture governing
the notes as written for the benefit of the holders, or as to how these change of control provisions would be
impacted were we to become a debtor in a bankruptcy case.

**We may enter into transactions that would not constitute a change of control that could affect our ability**
**to satisfy our obligations under the notes.**

Legal uncertainty regarding what constitutes a change of control and the provisions of the Indenture may
allow us to enter into transactions, such as acquisitions, refinancings or recapitalizations, that would not
constitute a change of control but may increase our outstanding indebtedness or otherwise affect our ability to
satisfy our obligations under the notes. The definition of change of control for purposes of the notes includes a
phrase relating to the transfer of “all or substantially all” of our assets taken as a whole. Although there is a
limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of
the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, your ability to require the Issuer to repurchase notes as a result of
a transfer of less than all of our assets to another person may be uncertain.

**The trading price of the notes may be volatile and can be directly affected by many factors, including our**
**credit rating.**

The trading price of the notes could be subject to significant fluctuation in response to, among other factors,
changes in our operating results, interest rates, the market for non-investment grade securities, general economic
conditions and securities analysts’ recommendations, if any, regarding our securities.

Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for companies they follow, including us. Any ratings
downgrade could adversely affect the trading price of the notes, or the trading market for the notes, to the extent
a trading market for the notes develops. The condition of the financial and credit markets and prevailing interest
rates have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future and any fluctuation may impact the
trading price of the notes. Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions
that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. We cannot assure you that
any such disruptions may not adversely affect the prices at which you may sell your notes. In addition,
subsequent to their initial issuance, the notes may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending
upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our performance and other factors.

**Holders of the notes will not be entitled to registration rights and we do not currently intend to register the**
**notes under applicable securities laws, and there are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the**
**notes.**

The notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws and we do not currently intend to register the notes or to offer to exchange the
notes for notes registered under the Securities Act. The holders of the notes will not be entitled to require us to
register the notes for resale or otherwise. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes in the United States only
in a transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite
period of time. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

40


-----

**We may be unable to repay or repurchase the notes at maturity.**

At maturity, the entire principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, will become due and
payable. We may not have the ability to repay or refinance these obligations. If the maturity date occurs at a time
when other arrangements prohibit us from repaying the notes, we would try to obtain waivers of such
prohibitions from the lenders and holders under those arrangements, or we could attempt to refinance the
borrowings that contain the restrictions. If we could not obtain the waivers or refinance these borrowings, we
would be unable to repay the notes.

41


-----

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We expect that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $ million after deducting
the estimated discount to the initial purchasers and the fees and expenses of this offering. We intend to use the
net proceeds from this offering to redeem all of the Existing Secured Notes currently outstanding, repay a portion
of the First-Lien Facility and pay related transaction fees and expenses, with any residual net proceeds being used
for general corporate purposes.

Certain of the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates may hold a portion of the Existing Secured Notes and,
as such, may receive a portion of the net proceeds in connection with this offering. Additionally, certain of the
initial purchasers and/or their affiliates may be lenders under the First-Lien Facility and, as such, may receive a
portion of the net proceeds in connection with the repayment of existing indebtedness under the First-Lien
Facility.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS**

_The following is a summary of certain provisions of the instruments evidencing the Issuer’s material_
_indebtedness. This summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by_
_reference to, all of the provisions of the agreements, including the definitions of certain terms therein that are not_
_otherwise defined in this offering circular._

**Senior Secured Credit Facilities**

On July 31, 2015, the Issuer entered into a $600.0 million term loan credit agreement (the “Term Loan
Credit Agreement”) with Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch as administrative agent and collateral agent. The
Term Loan Credit Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, provided for the First-Lien
Facility.

In addition, on July 31, 2015, the Issuer amended and restated the ABL Facility, with SunTrust Bank as
administrative agent and collateral agent. The ABL Facility provides for revolving credit financings of up to
approximately $800.0 million, subject to availability under the borrowing base thereunder. The borrowing base
for the ABL Facility, which determines availability under the ABL Facility, is based on a percentage of the value
of certain of the assets comprising the ABL Collateral.

**Maturity; Mandatory Prepayments**

The First-Lien Facility matures on July 31, 2022. The ABL Facility matures on July 31, 2020.

Subject to certain exceptions, the First-Lien Facility is subject to mandatory prepayments, including in
amounts equal to:

   - 100% of the net cash proceeds from issuances or the incurrence of debt by the Issuer or any of the
guarantors (other than certain indebtedness permitted by the First-Lien Facility);

   - 100% of the net cash proceeds from certain sales or other dispositions of assets (including as a result of
casualty or condemnation) by the Issuer or any of the guarantors in excess of a certain amount and subject
to customary reinvestment provisions and certain other exceptions; and

   - 50% (with stepdowns to 25% and 0% based upon achievement of specified first lien net leverage ratios)
of annual excess cash flow of the Issuer and the guarantors, subject to customary exceptions and
limitations.

**Security; Guarantees**

The obligations of the Issuer under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are guaranteed by each of its direct
and indirect, existing and future, domestic subsidiaries, subject to customary exceptions and limitations.

The ABL Facility is secured by a first priority lien over the ABL Collateral and a second priority lien over
Notes Collateral. The First-Lien Facility is secured by a first priority lien on the Notes Collateral and a second
priority lien on the ABL Collateral, in each case, prior to the offering of notes hereby and the redemption of the
Existing Secured Notes, shared with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as collateral agent under that
certain indenture, date as of May 29, 2013, by and among, inter alios, the Issuer, as issuer, and Wilmington Trust,
National Association, as trustee and Notes Collateral Agent.

**Interest**

At the Issuer’s election, the interest rate per annum applicable to loans issued under the First-Lien Facility is
based on a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to either (i) a base rate determined by reference to
the higher of (a) the rate last quoted by the administrative agent as its “prime rate” (or certain alternative “prime

44


-----

rates”), (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% and (c) (x) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)
applicable for an interest period of one month, plus (y) 1.00% per annum, in each case, plus an applicable margin
or (ii) LIBOR, plus an applicable margin.

At the Issuer’s election, the interest rate per annum applicable to loans issued under the ABL Facility is based
on a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to either (i) a base rate determined by reference to the
highest of (a) the rate which the administrative agent under the ABL Facility announces from time to time as its
prime lending rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% and (c) (x) the Eurodollar rate applicable for an
interest period of one month, plus (y) 1.00% per annum, in each case, plus an applicable margin or (ii) an adjusted
LIBOR rate determined by reference to the higher of (a) LIBOR and (b) 0%, in each case, plus an applicable
margin.

**Fees**

We must pay certain recurring fees with respect to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including, (i) fees on
the unused commitments of the lenders under the ABL Facility, (ii) letter of credit fees on the aggregate face
amounts of outstanding letters of credit plus a fronting fee to the issuing bank plus additional charges upon each
drawing under, or amendment, extension, renewal or transfer of, a letter of credit and (iii) administration fees.

**Covenants**

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants
that, among other things, limit or restrict the ability of the Issuer and the guarantors to:

   - incur additional indebtedness (including guarantee obligations);

   - incur liens;

   - engage in mergers or other fundamental changes;

   - sell certain property or assets;

   - pay dividends or other distributions;

   - make acquisitions, investments, loans and advances;

   - prepay certain indebtedness;

   - change the nature of their business;

   - engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and

   - incur restrictions on contractual obligations limiting interactions between the Issuer and its subsidiaries or
limit actions in relation to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

In addition, the ABL Facility contains a springing financial covenant that requires the Issuer, after failure to
meet the minimum availability threshold, to comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (consolidated
EBITDA minus taxes plus tax refunds minus capital expenditures to Fixed Charges (as defined in the ABL
Facility)) of 1.00 to 1.00. Under the ABL Facility, consolidated EBITDA includes additional add-backs to net
income for certain costs, fees, taxes, losses, charges, write-offs, write-downs and expenses and Fixed Charges
include cash interest expenses, scheduled principal payments in respect of funded indebtedness and the amount
of certain restricted payments.

**Events of Default**

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain customary events of default, including with respect to
nonpayment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts; material inaccuracy of a representation or warranty; failure

45


-----

to perform or observe covenants; bankruptcy and insolvency events; monetary judgment defaults in an amount of
$50 million; actual or asserted invalidity or impairment of any material definitive loan documentation; and a change
of control.

**Existing Secured Notes**

The Issuer’s Existing Secured Notes were issued pursuant to the indenture, dated as of May 29, 2013, by
and between the Issuer, certain subsidiaries of the Issuer, as guarantors, and Wilmington Trust, National
Association, as trustee and Notes Collateral Agent (the “Existing Secured Indenture”). The Issuer pays interest on
the Existing Secured Notes at a rate of 7.625% per annum semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of
each year. The Existing Secured Notes mature on June 1, 2021. The Issuer expects to use the net proceeds from
this offering, in part, to redeem all the Existing Secured Notes currently outstanding.

**Existing Unsecured Notes**

The Issuer’s Existing Unsecured Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of July 31, 2015, by
and between the Issuer, certain subsidiaries of the Issuer, as guarantors, and Wilmington Trust, National
Association, as trustee (the “Existing Unsecured Indenture”). The Issuer pays interest on the Existing Unsecured
Notes at a rate of 10.75% per annum semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year.

**Optional Redemption**

The Issuer has the right to redeem the Existing Unsecured Notes at the redemption prices set forth below:

   - at any time (which may be more than once) before August 15, 2018, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of
the aggregate principal amount of the Existing Unsecured Notes with the net proceeds of one or more
equity offerings at a price of 110.75% of the face amount of the Existing Secured Notes, plus accrued and
unpaid interest to the date of redemption;

   - at any time prior to August 15, 2018, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Existing Unsecured Notes at
a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the applicable premium as of, and
accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the date of the redemption. Applicable
premium is the greater of:

(1) 1.0% of the principal amount of such Existing Unsecured Note; and

(2) the excess (to the extent positive) of (a) the present value at such applicable date of redemption
(the “Redemption Date”) of (i) the redemption price of such Existing Unsecured Note at August
15, 2018 (108.063%), excluding accrued but unpaid interest, if any, plus (ii) all required interest
payments due on such Existing Unsecured Note through August 15, 2018, excluding accrued but
unpaid interest, if any, computed upon the Redemption Date using a discount rate equal to the
Applicable Treasury Rate (as defined in the Existing Unsecured Indenture) as of such Redemption
Date plus 50 basis points; over (b) the principal amount of such Existing Unsecured Note;

   - on and after August 15, 2018, the Issuer may redeem the Existing Unsecured Notes, in whole or in part at
the redemption prices (expressed in percentages of principal amount of the Existing Unsecured Notes to
be redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but excluding, the
applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on August 15 of the
years set forth below:

**Change of Control**

If a change of control occurs with respect to the Issuer, unless the Issuer has exercised its right to redeem all
of the outstanding Existing Unsecured Notes, each noteholder shall have the right to require the Issuer to
repurchase such noteholder’s Existing Unsecured Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase.

**Covenants and Events of Default**

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

The following is a description of the $750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of % senior secured notes
due 2024 (the “Notes”). The Notes will be issued by Builders FirstSource, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
“Company”). In this Description of the Notes, the term “Company” refers only to Builders FirstSource, Inc. and
not to any of its Subsidiaries.

The Company will issue the Notes under an indenture (the “Indenture”) to be dated as of the Issue Date,
among the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”)
and the collateral agent (in such capacity, the “Notes Collateral Agent”). The Notes will be issued in a private
transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Notice to Investors.”
The Notes are subject to all such terms pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, and Holders of the Notes are
referred to the Indenture for a statement thereof.

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Collateral Documents.
Because this is a summary, it may not contain all the information that is important to you. You should read the
Indenture and the Collateral Documents in their entirety. Copies of the proposed forms of the Indenture and the
Collateral Documents are available as described under “Where You Can Find More Information.” You can find
the definitions of certain terms used in this description under “—Certain Definitions.” The capitalized terms
defined in “—Certain Definitions” below are used in this “Description of the Notes” as so defined.

The Company does not intend to list the Notes on any securities exchange. The Company will not be
required to, nor does the Company currently intend to, offer to exchange the Notes for notes registered under the
Securities Act or otherwise register or qualify by prospectus the Notes for resale under the Securities Act. The
Indenture will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act or subject to the terms of the Trust Indenture Act.
Accordingly, the terms of the Notes include only those stated in the Indenture.

**Brief Description of the Notes and the Note Guarantees**

The Notes will be:

   - general senior secured obligations of the Company;

   - pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Senior Indebtedness (including guarantees of
the Credit Agreement, the ABL and the Existing Unsecured Notes) of the Company;

   - secured on a first-priority basis by the Notes Collateral owned by the Company and on a second-priority
basis by the ABL Collateral owned by the Company, in each case subject to certain Liens permitted under
the Indenture;

   - equal in priority as to the Notes Collateral owned by the Company with respect to the Credit Agreement
Obligations, and the Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations (if any) incurred after the Issue Date;

   - senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company;

   - unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis, jointly and severally, by each Guarantor;

   - effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of the Company to the extent of the
value of the Collateral owned by the Company (after giving effect to any senior Lien on such Collateral
including in respect of the Lien on the ABL Priority Collateral Securing the ABL Obligations), and
effectively senior to all existing and future Indebtedness under the ABL and the other ABL Obligations to
the extent of the value of the Notes Collateral owned by the Company;

   - effectively subordinated to (i) the Company’s existing and future Indebtedness under the ABL and the
other ABL Obligations to the extent of the value of the ABL Collateral owned by the Company and (ii)
any existing and future Indebtedness of the Company that is secured by Liens on assets that do not
constitute a part of the Collateral to the extent of the value of such assets; and

48


-----

   - structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities, including preferred
stock, of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries and any other Subsidiaries of the Company that are not Guarantors.

Each Note Guarantee (as defined below) will be:

   - a general senior secured obligation of the applicable Guarantor;

   - pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of that Guarantor,
including its guarantee of the ABL Credit Agreement, the ABL and the Existing Unsecured Notes;

   - secured on a first-priority basis by the Notes Collateral owned by that Guarantor and on a second-priority
basis by the ABL Collateral owned by that Guarantor, in each case subject to certain Liens permitted
under the Indenture;

   - equal in priority as to the Notes Collateral owned by that Guarantor with respect to the Credit Agreement
Obligations, and the Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations of that Guarantor (if any) incurred after the Issue
Date;

   - senior in right of payment to all future Subordinated Indebtedness of that Guarantor;

   - effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of that Guarantor, to the extent of the
value of the Collateral owned by that Guarantor (after giving effect to any senior Lien on such Collateral,
including in respect of the Lien on the ABL Priority Collateral securing the ABL Obligations), and
effectively senior to any existing and future Obligations of that Guarantor under the ABL and the other
ABL Obligations of that Guarantor to the extent of the value of the Notes Collateral owned by that
Guarantor;

   - effectively subordinated to (i) any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor under the ABL and
the other ABL Obligations of that Guarantor to the extent of the value of the ABL Collateral owned by
that Guarantor and (ii) any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is secured by Liens on
assets that do not constitute a part of the Collateral to the extent of the value of such assets; and

   - structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities, including preferred
stock, of any Subsidiaries of that Guarantor that are not Guarantors.

As of June 30, 2016, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, (1) the Company’s
outstanding senior Indebtedness would have been approximately $2,022.3 million, $1,604.7 million of which
would have been Secured Indebtedness, including $269.3 million in lease finance obligations and $9.5 million of
capital leases; and (2) our borrowing base under our ABL would have been approximately $848.3 million and we
would have had approximately $611.0 million of availability thereunder, after deducting $85.0 million of
outstanding and undrawn letters of credit.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Company will issue Notes in minimum denominations of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in
excess thereof. The rights of Holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive the payments on such Notes
are subject to applicable procedures of DTC. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a
Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to
payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any
further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

The Company will issue an aggregate principal amount of $750,000,000 of Notes on the Issue Date. The
Notes will mature on, 2024 . Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate per annum set forth on the
cover of this offering circular and will be payable, in cash, semi-annually in arrears on and of
each year, commencing on, 2017, to Holders of record on the immediately preceding
and, respectively. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been
paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of original issuance. If the Company delivers global notes to
the Trustee for cancellation on a date that is after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest

49


-----

payment date, then interest shall be paid in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC. Interest will be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Each interest period will end on
(but not include) the relevant interest payment date.

**Additional Notes**

The Company may issue additional Notes (the “Additional Notes”) from time to time under the Indenture.
The Indenture will provide for the issuance of Additional Notes having identical terms and conditions to the
Notes offered hereby, subject to compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture. Additional Notes will
be part of the same issue as the Notes offered hereby under the Indenture for all purposes, including waivers,
amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase and Holders of Additional Notes will share equally and ratably
in the Collateral with other Holders; provided that Additional Notes will not be issued with the same CUSIP as
the Notes offered hereby unless such Additional Notes are fungible with the Notes offered hereby for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.

**Payments**

Principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be payable at the office or agency of the
Company maintained for such purpose (along with any other paying agent maintained by the Company, the
“Paying Agent”) or, at the option of the Paying Agent, payment of interest, if any, may be made by check mailed
to the Holders of the Notes at their respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders or by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holders of the Notes provided that all payments of
principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to Notes represented by one or more global notes registered
in the name of or held by the DTC or its nominee will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the accounts specified by the Holders thereof. Until otherwise designated by the Company, the Company’s office
or agency maintained for such purpose will be the office of the Trustee.

**Guarantees**

The obligations of the Company under the Notes and the Indenture will be, jointly and severally,
unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis (the “Note Guarantees”) by each existing and future
Wholly-Owned Domestic Restricted Subsidiary (the “Guarantors”) that Guarantees the Company’s obligations
under the Credit Agreement. Following the Issue Date, Subsidiaries will be required to Guarantee the Notes to
the extent described in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees.”

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2016, after giving effect to the Acquisition Transactions, those
subsidiaries of the Company that will not serve as guarantors accounted for a de minimis percentage of the
Company’s sales, Adjusted EBITDA, total assets and total liabilities.

Each Note Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Note Guarantor’s
obligations subject to avoidance under applicable law as a fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or unjust
preference, including provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or
state law or provincial law to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this
limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable
with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note Guarantee. See “Risk
Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal and state statutes allow courts, under
specific circumstances, to void notes and require note holders to return payments received.”

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate upon:

(1) a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, merger or amalgamation) of the Capital
Stock of such Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor
to a Person other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and as otherwise permitted by the
Indenture;

50


-----

(2) the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or the
occurrence of any event after which the Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary;

(3) defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and
Discharge”;

(4) to the extent that such Guarantor is not an Immaterial Subsidiary solely due to the operation of clause
(i) of the definition of “Immaterial Subsidiary,” upon the release of the guarantee referred to in such
clause;

(5) such Guarantor being released from all of (i) its obligations under all of its Guarantees of payment by
the Company of any Indebtedness of the Company under the Credit Agreement and all other
Indebtedness with Pari Passu Lien Priority relative to the Notes or (ii) in the case of a Note Guarantee
made by a Guarantor (each, an “Other Guarantee”) as a result of its guarantee of other Indebtedness of
the Company or a Guarantor pursuant to the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Guarantees,” the relevant Indebtedness, except in the case of (i) or (ii), a release as a result of payment
under such Guarantee (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still
considered a release, and if any such Guarantee of such Guarantor under the Credit Agreement or any
Other Guarantee is so reinstated, such Note Guarantee shall also be reinstated); or a refinancing or
repayment in full of the Credit Agreement and/or such other Indebtedness with Pari Passu Lien Priority
relative to the Notes; and

(6) solely if such Guarantor does not Guarantee Indebtedness (or commitments in respect thereof) (other
than the Notes) with Pari Passu Lien Priority relative to the Notes (for the avoidance of doubt, prior to
giving effect to any release pursuant to this clause (6)) immediately prior and during the Suspension
Period, upon the achievement of Investment Grade Status by the Notes; provided that such Note
Guarantee shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date or, if earlier, the Guarantee by such Guarantor
of Indebtedness (or commitments in respect thereof) with Pari Passu Lien Priority relative to the Notes
(for the avoidance of doubt, prior to giving effect to any release pursuant to this clause (6)).

Claims of creditors of Non-Guarantors, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding
debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of
those Subsidiaries and claims against joint ventures generally will have priority with respect to the assets and
earnings of those Subsidiaries and joint ventures over the claims of creditors of the Company, including Holders
of the Notes. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefor will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including
trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Company (other than the
Guarantors) and joint ventures. Although the Indenture limits the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions.
Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities
that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

**Security**

The Notes and the Guarantees will have the benefit of the Collateral, which will consist of (i) the Notes
Collateral, as to which the Holders of the Notes and holders of the Credit Agreement Obligations and future
Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations (if any) will have a first-priority security interest (subject to Permitted Liens)
and the ABL Lenders and the other holders of ABL Obligations will have a second-priority security interest, and
(ii) the ABL Collateral, as to which the ABL Lenders and the other holders of ABL Obligations will have a firstpriority security interest and the Holders of the Notes and holders of the Credit Agreement Obligations and future
Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations (if any) will have a second-priority security interest (subject to Permitted
Liens).

The Company and the Guarantors will be able to incur additional Indebtedness in the future that could share
in the Collateral. The amount of all such additional Indebtedness will be limited by the covenants disclosed under

51


-----

“—Certain Covenants—Liens” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.” Under certain
circumstances the amount of such additional Secured Indebtedness could be significant. See “Risk Factors—
Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may be able to
incur substantially more debt and enter into other transactions which could further exacerbate the risks to our
financial condition described above” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—
There are certain categories of property that are excluded from the Collateral.”

**Notes Collateral**

The Notes Collateral will be pledged as collateral to the Notes Collateral Agent for the benefit of the
Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent, and the Holders of the Notes. The Notes Collateral was previously pledged
as collateral to the Term Loan Credit Agreement Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Credit Agreement
Obligations. The Notes and Guarantees, together with the Credit Agreement Obligations and future Other Pari
Passu Lien Obligations (if any), will be secured by first-priority security interests in the Notes Collateral, subject
to Permitted Liens. The Notes Collateral generally consists of substantially all present and future tangible and
intangible assets of the Company and the Guarantors (including, all of the Capital Stock owned by the Company
or any Guarantor other than Excluded Equity Interests) in each case other than (i) the ABL Collateral and (ii)
Excluded Assets.

Initially, subject to Permitted Liens, only the Notes, the Guarantees and the Credit Agreement Obligations
will have the benefit of the first-priority security interest in the Notes Collateral. Except for Indebtedness secured
by Permitted Liens (including, the Credit Agreement Obligations and, subject to the terms described herein,
future Indebtedness constituting Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations), no other Indebtedness incurred by the
Company or any Guarantor may share in the first-priority security interest in the Notes Collateral.

The Company and the Guarantors have granted a second-priority Lien on and security interest in the Notes
Collateral for the benefit of the ABL Lenders and the other holders of ABL Obligations, which initially will
consist of the loans outstanding under the ABL made by the ABL Lenders, obligations with respect to letters of
credit issued under the ABL, certain hedging obligations incurred with the ABL Lenders or their affiliates
pursuant to a Secured Hedge Agreement and Banking Product Obligations and any other ABL Obligations under
the ABL. Any additional Indebtedness that is incurred by the Company or any Guarantor in compliance with the
terms of the Indenture may also be given a Lien on and security interest in the Notes Collateral that ranks junior
to the Lien of the Notes Secured Parties in the Notes Collateral. See “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Except as
provided in the ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement, holders of such junior Liens will not be able to take any
enforcement action with respect to the Notes Collateral so long as any Notes are outstanding.

**ABL Collateral**

The Credit Agreement Obligations are, and the Notes, the Guarantees and future Other Pari Passu Lien
Obligations (if any) will also be, secured by a second-priority Lien on and security interest in the ABL Collateral
(subject to Permitted Liens). The ABL Collateral generally consists of the following assets of the Company and
the Guarantors (other than Excluded Assets) whether now owned or hereafter acquired:

   - accounts (including credit card receivables) and all other rights to payment arising from services rendered
or from the sale, lease, use or other disposition of inventory, whether such rights to payment constitute
payment intangibles, letter-of-credit rights or any other classification of property, or are evidenced in
whole or in part by instruments, chattel paper or documents;

   - inventory and documents relating to inventory;

   - all rights of an unpaid vendor with respect to inventory;

   - deposit accounts (other than separately maintained insurance deposit accounts), commodity accounts,
securities accounts and lockboxes, including all money and certificated securities, uncertificated
securities (other than Capital Stock of Subsidiaries of the Company and the Guarantors), securities

52


-----

entitlements and related investment property (including all cash, marketable securities and other funds
held in or on deposit in any deposit account, commodity account or securities account), and all cash and
cash equivalents, including cash and cash equivalents securing reimbursement obligations in respect of
letters of credit or other ABL Obligations;

   - instruments, chattel paper and general intangibles pertaining to the other items of property otherwise
comprising ABL Collateral (other than any Capital Stock of Subsidiaries of the Company and Guarantors
and intellectual property);

   - books and records, supporting obligations, documents and related letters of credit, letter-of-credit rights,
commercial tort claims or other claims and causes of action, in each case, to the extent arising out of,
related to or given in exchange or settlement of any of the foregoing; and

   - all substitutions, replacements, accessions, products and proceeds (including, without limitation,
insurance proceeds, licenses, royalties, income, payments, claims, damages and proceeds of suit) of all or
any of the foregoing.

All terms used in the preceding paragraph and defined in the UCC and not otherwise defined in this offering
circular have the meanings given to such terms in the UCC; provided that the term “instrument” has the meaning
given to such term in Article 9 of the UCC.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to the provisions of the ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement, the
ABL Collateral will not include any identifiable cash proceeds from a sale, lease, conveyance or other disposition
of any Notes Collateral that has been deposited in the Collateral Account in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture, the Collateral Documents and the ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement, until such time as such cash
proceeds are released therefrom in accordance with the terms of such agreements.

**Limitation on Certain Collateral and Perfection Items**

The Company and its Subsidiaries will not be required under the terms of the Indenture or the Collateral
Documents to deliver landlord lien waivers, estoppels or collateral access letters and will not be required to
subject any accounts (other than any Collateral Account), securities accounts or commodities accounts to control
agreements; provided that Collateral shall not include any Excluded Assets or Excluded Equity Interests.

**Possession of the Collateral**

Subject to the terms of the Collateral Documents, and unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing and the Notes Collateral Agent or, subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreements, the ABL
Collateral Agent or Credit Agreement Collateral Agent shall have commenced enforcement of remedies with
respect to the Collateral, the Company and the Guarantors will have the right to remain in possession and retain
exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Obligations under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Indenture
(other than any cash, securities and Cash Equivalents constituting part of the Collateral and deposited with the
Notes Collateral Agent or the ABL Collateral Agent, as applicable in accordance with the provisions of the
Collateral Documents), to freely operate the Notes Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income
therefrom. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—We will, in most cases, have
control over the Notes Collateral, and the sale or pledge of particular assets by us could reduce the pool of assets
securing the Notes and the guarantees.”

**Information Regarding Collateral**

The Company will furnish to the Notes Collateral Agent, with respect to the Company or any Guarantor,
prompt written notice of any change in such Person’s (i) organizational name, (ii) jurisdiction of organization or
formation, (iii) identity or organizational structure or (iv) organizational identification number. The Company
and the Guarantors will agree to make all filings under the UCC or equivalent statutes, or otherwise that are
required by applicable law in order for the Notes Collateral Agent to continue at all times following such change
to have a valid, legal and perfected security interest in all the Collateral.

53


-----

**Further Assurances and After-Acquired Property**

Subject to the applicable limitations set forth in the Collateral Documents and the Indenture (including with
respect to Excluded Assets), the Company and the Guarantors shall execute any and all further documents,
financing statements, applications for registration, agreements and instruments, and take all further action that
may be required under applicable law, or that the Notes Collateral Agent may reasonably request, in order to
grant, preserve, protect and perfect the validity and priority of the security interests created or intended to be
created by the Collateral Documents in the Collateral. Subject to the applicable limitations set forth in the
Collateral Documents and the Indenture (including with respect to Excluded Assets), if, after the Issue Date, the
Company or a Guarantor acquires property that is not automatically subject to a perfected security interest under
the Collateral Documents and such property constitutes or would constitute Collateral (including, without
limitation, any asset of the Company or a Guarantor that becomes Collateral subsequent to the Issue Date as a
result of such asset ceasing to be an Excluded Asset) or an entity becomes a Guarantor, then the Company or
such Guarantor will, as soon as practicable, but in any event, within 90 days, provide for security over such
property (or, in the case of a new Guarantor, its assets of the type that would constitute Collateral under the
Collateral Documents) in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent and deliver certain joinder agreements or
supplements as required by the Indenture and the Collateral Documents and take all actions required by the
Collateral Documents and the Indenture to perfect the liens created by the Collateral Documents.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the Discharge of the ABL Obligations, the Company and the Guarantors
shall only be required to comply with the foregoing requirements with respect to any ABL Collateral to the
extent that such ABL Collateral is concurrently being pledged to secure the ABL Obligations.

**Collateral Documents and Certain Related Intercreditor Provisions**

The Company, the Guarantors and the Notes Collateral Agent (on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders of
the Notes) will enter into one or more Collateral Documents creating and establishing the terms of the security
interests that secure the Notes and the Guarantees and any Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations (if any). These
security interests will secure the payment and performance when due of all of the obligations of the Company
and the Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture, the Guarantees and the Collateral Documents and any
applicable Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations (if any), as provided in the Collateral Documents. The Company
and the Guarantors will complete all filings and other similar actions required in connection with the provision
and/or perfection of security interests in the Collateral that may be perfected by the filing of a financing
statement under the UCC and the pledge of the Capital Stock of any Domestic Subsidiary (to the extent not
constituting an Excluded Asset), in each case on the Issue Date. In addition, the Company and the Guarantors
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to complete all other filings and other similar actions required in
connection with the provision and/or perfection of security interests on other Collateral on the Issue Date, but to
the extent they are unable to do so without undue burden or expense, will in any event complete such actions
within 90 days following the Issue Date subject to the below provisions of this paragraph regarding real property
Collateral. Wilmington Trust, National Association will be appointed, pursuant to the Indenture, as the Notes
Collateral Agent. The Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent and each Holder of Notes and each other holder of, or
obligee in respect of, any Obligations in respect of the Notes outstanding at such time are referred to collectively
as the “Noteholder Secured Parties.” Certain security interests in real property Collateral including all mortgages
on real property Collateral, will not be in place on the Issue Date or will not be validly created and perfected on
the Issue Date. The Company and the Guarantors will use commercially reasonable efforts to perfect on the Issue
Date the security interests in the real property Collateral for the benefit of the Holders of Notes that are created
on the Issue Date, but to the extent any such security interest cannot be perfected by such date, the Company will
use commercially reasonable efforts to do or cause to be done all acts and things that may be required, to have all
security interests in the real property Collateral duly created and enforceable and perfected, to the extent required
by the security documents, promptly following the Issue Date, and all such security interests in the real property
Collateral will have been duly created and be enforceable and perfected, to the extent required by the security
documents, no later than the later of (a) 90 days after the Issue Date and (b) the date such security interests in the
real property Collateral are required to be duly created and enforceable and perfected under the Collateral
Documents (after giving effect to any waiver or extension obtained from the Holders of the Notes thereunder).

54


-----

With regard to any property upon which a security interest must be perfected, such security interests and Liens
will be created under the Collateral Documents in form and substance reasonably necessary to grant to the Notes
Collateral Agent, on behalf of the Holders of the Notes, a security interest in such collateral and the Company
and the Guarantors shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Notes Collateral Agent, on behalf of the Holders
of the Notes, all such instruments and documents (including certificates, legal opinions and lien searches) as are
necessary to evidence compliance with this covenant. With regard to any property upon which a security interest
must be perfected, the Company and the Guarantors shall deliver to the Notes Collateral Agent, on behalf of the
Holders of the Notes, new title insurance policies insuring the Lien of the applicable mortgage or deed of trust on
any real property Collateral upon which a security interest must be perfected in a customary form. The Company
and the Guarantors shall deliver a survey to the Notes Collateral Agent, on behalf of the Holders of the Notes,
and will otherwise ensure that the title insurance policies issued to the Notes Collateral Agent with respect to
such real property contains customary survey coverage. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness
and the Notes—Security over certain collateral will not be in place by the closing date of the offering or may not
be perfected, or a valid lien may not be created, on the closing date of the offering.”

**ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement**

The Notes Collateral Agent will become a party to the ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement. Although the
Holders of the Notes are not party to the ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement, by their acceptance of the Notes
they will agree to be bound by the terms of the ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement. If any other Indebtedness is
designated as Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations and is permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Credit
Agreement and the ABL (or any other applicable Credit Facility) to be secured by the Collateral on a pari passu
basis with the Notes and the Guarantees, the representatives of the holders of such Other Pari Passu Lien
Obligations will also become party to the ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement and the Pari Passu Intercreditor
Agreement. See also “—Pari Passu Intercreditor Arrangements.”

Pursuant to the terms of the ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement, prior to the discharge of the Obligations
with respect to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Indenture, the Credit Agreement Obligations (and Other Pari
Passu Lien Obligations (if any)), the “Applicable Authorized Representative” under the Pari Passu Intercreditor
Agreement will determine the time and method by which the security interests in the Notes Collateral will be
enforced and, prior to the Discharge of the ABL Obligations, the ABL Collateral Agent will determine the time
and method by which the security interests in the ABL Collateral will be enforced.

**Lien Subordination**

Notwithstanding the time, order or method of creation, attachment or perfection of any Lien in respect of
any ABL Collateral and notwithstanding any provision of any applicable law, any security document or any other
document or instrument, the Notes Collateral Agent will agree on behalf of the Noteholder Secured Parties that:
the Liens of the Notes Collateral Agent in respect of the ABL Collateral, shall be expressly subordinate and
junior in right, priority, operation and effect to any Lien of the ABL Collateral Agent in respect of the ABL
Collateral. The ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement will provide for subordination of the ABL Collateral
Agent’s Lien with respect to the Notes Collateral and the priority of the Notes Collateral Agent’s and Credit
Agreement Collateral Agent’s Liens with respect to the Notes Collateral.

**No Action with Respect to the ABL Collateral**

The ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement provides that, with respect to the ABL Collateral, none of the
Noteholder Secured Parties (or holders of Credit Agreement Obligations or Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations (if
any)) may (or may direct the Notes Collateral Agent or the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent or any
representative with respect to Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations, if applicable, to) (i) commence any judicial or
nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official
appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect

55


-----

to, or otherwise exercise or join any other person in exercising any right, remedy or power with respect to, or
otherwise take any action to enforce its interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in
respect of any ABL Collateral, other than certain limited protective measures, (ii) challenge or question in any
proceeding the validity or enforceability of any ABL Obligations or related security document, or the validity,
attachment, perfection or priority of any Lien securing ABL Obligations, or the validity or enforceability of the
priorities, rights or duties established by or other provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, (iii) it will not itself
take or cause to be taken any action the purpose or intent of which is, or could be, to interfere with, hinder or
delay, in any manner, whether by judicial proceedings or otherwise, any sale, transfer or other disposition of the
ABL Collateral by any ABL Secured Parties, (iv) it shall have no right to (A) direct ABL Collateral Agent or any
holder of ABL Obligations to exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to the ABL Collateral or (B)
consent to the exercise by any ABL Secured Party of any right, remedy or power with respect to the ABL
Collateral, (v) it will not itself institute any suit or assert in any suit or Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding any
claim against any ABL Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance,
instructions or otherwise with respect to, and no ABL Secured Party shall be liable for, any action taken or
omitted to be taken by such ABL Secured Party with respect to any ABL Collateral and (vi) it will not seek, and
waives any right, to have any ABL Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other
disposition of such ABL Collateral. In addition to the foregoing, the ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement
provides that the ABL Collateral Agent has the exclusive right to take any enforcement action with respect to the
ABL Collateral without any consultation with and without the consent of any Noteholder Secured Party (or
holder of Credit Agreement Obligations or Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations (if any)). The ABL-Notes
Intercreditor Agreement provides reciprocal limitations on the ABL Secured Parties’ rights to take action with
respect to the Notes Collateral.

**Collateral Access Rights**

If the ABL Collateral Agent takes any enforcement action with respect to the ABL Lien Collateral, the Pari
Notes Debt Secured Parties (i) shall cooperate with the ABL Agent (at the sole cost and expense of the ABL
Agent and subject to the condition that the Pari Notes Debt Secured Parties shall have no obligation or duty to
take any action or refrain from taking any action that could reasonably be expected to result in the incurrence of
any liability or damage to the Pari Notes Debt Secured Parties) in its efforts to enforce its security interest in the
ABL Collateral and to finish any work-in-process and assemble the ABL Collateral, (ii) shall not take any action
designed or intended to hinder or restrict in any respect the ABL Agent from enforcing its security interest in the
ABL Collateral or from finishing any work-in-process or assembling the ABL Collateral, and (iii) subject to the
rights of any landlords under real estate leases, shall permit the ABL Agent, its employees, agents, advisers and
representatives, at the sole cost and expense of the ABL Secured Parties and upon reasonable advance notice, to
enter upon and use the Notes Collateral (including equipment, processors, computers and other machinery related
to the storage or processing of records, documents or files), for a period not to exceed 180 days after the taking of
such enforcement action, for purposes of (1) assembling and storing the ABL Collateral and completing the
processing of and turning into finished goods of any ABL Collateral consisting of work-in-process, (2) selling
any or all of the ABL Collateral located on such Notes Collateral, whether in bulk, in lots or to customers in the
ordinary course of business or otherwise, (3) removing any or all of the ABL Collateral located on such Notes
Collateral, or (4) taking reasonable actions to protect, secure and otherwise enforce the rights of the ABL Secured
Parties in and to the ABL Collateral; provided, however, that nothing contained in the ABL-Notes Intercreditor
Agreement shall restrict the rights of any Pari Notes Debt Agent from selling, assigning or otherwise transferring
any Notes Collateral prior to the expiration of such 180-day period if the purchaser, assignee or transferee thereof
agrees to be bound by this provisions. If any stay or other order prohibiting the exercise of remedies with respect
to the ABL Collateral has been entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, such 180-day period shall be tolled
during the pendency of any such stay or other order. If the ABL Agent conducts a public auction or private sale
of the ABL Collateral at any of the real property included within the Notes Collateral, the ABL Agent shall
provide each Pari Notes Debt Agent with reasonable notice and use reasonable efforts to hold such auction, or
sale in a manner which would not unduly disrupt such Pari Notes Debt Agent’s use of such real property.

56


-----

Each Pari Notes Debt Agent and each Pari Notes Debt Secured Party, in its capacity as a secured party (or as
a purchaser, assignee or transferee, as applicable), and to the extent of its interest therein, has granted or will
grant to the ABL Agent and the ABL Secured Parties a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide
license to use, license or sublicense any and all intellectual property now owned or hereafter acquired included as
part of the Notes Collateral (and including in such license access to all media in which any of the licensed items
may be recorded or stored and to all computer software and programs used for the compilation or printout
thereof) as is or may be necessary or advisable in the ABL Agent’s reasonable judgment for the ABL Agent to
process, ship, produce, store, supply, lease, complete, sell, liquidate or otherwise deal with the ABL Collateral, or
to collect or otherwise realize upon any accounts receivable comprising ABL Collateral, in each case solely in
connection with any exercise of remedies available to the ABL Secured Parties; provided that (i) any such license
shall terminate upon the sale of the applicable ABL Collateral and shall not extend or transfer to the purchaser of
such ABL Collateral, (ii) the ABL Agent’s use of such intellectual property shall be reasonable and lawful, and
(iii) any such license is granted on an “AS-IS” basis, without any representation or warranty whatsoever.
Furthermore, each Pari Notes Debt Agent agrees that, in connection with any exercise of remedies available to
any Pari Notes Debt Agent in respect of Notes Collateral, such Pari Notes Debt Agent shall provide written
notice to any purchaser, assignee or transferee of intellectual property pursuant to such exercise of remedies, that
the applicable intellectual property is subject to such license.

**Tracing of Proceeds of ABL Collateral and Notes Collateral**

The ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement provides that, prior to an issuance of any Enforcement Notice with
respect to Collateral or the commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, any proceeds of
Collateral, whether or not deposited under Account Agreements, which are used by any Grantor to acquire other
property which is Collateral shall not (solely as between the ABL Agent, the ABL Secured Parties, on the one
hand, and the Pari Notes Debt Agents and the Pari Notes Debt Secured Parties) be treated as proceeds of
Collateral for purposes of determining the relative priorities in the Collateral which was so acquired. In addition,
unless and until the discharge of ABL Obligations occurs, the Pari Notes Debt Agents and the Pari Notes Debt
Secured Parties by consent to the application, prior to the receipt by the ABL Agent of an Enforcement Notice
issued by any Pari Notes Debt Agent, of cash or other proceeds of Collateral, deposited under control agreements
to the repayment of ABL Obligations pursuant to the ABL documents; provided that after the receipt by the ABL
Agent of an Enforcement Notice from any Pari Notes Debt Agent, any identifiable proceeds of Notes Collateral
(whether or not deposited under Account Agreements with the ABL Agent) shall be treated as Notes Collateral.

**No Duties of the ABL Secured Parties**

The ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement provides that none of the ABL Secured Parties have any duty or
liability and each Noteholder Secured Party (and each holder of Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations (if
any)) waives, under the ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement, all claims against any of the ABL Secured Parties
arising out of any and all actions any ABL Secured Party may take or permit or omit to take ( including with
respect to: the foreclosure upon, sale, release or depreciation of, or failure to realize upon, the ABL Collateral) in
accordance with the ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement, the ABL Documents or any other agreement related
thereto or the collection of the ABL Obligations or the valuation, use, protection or release of any security for the
ABL Obligations. In addition, the ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement further provides that the ABL Collateral
Agent is entitled to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of or deal with the ABL Collateral without regard to the
second-priority security interest of the Notes Collateral Agent on such ABL Collateral or any rights to which any
Noteholder Secured Party (or holder of Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations (if any)) would otherwise be entitled as
a result of such second-priority security interest.

57


-----

**Payment Over; No New Liens Reinstatement**

Each Pari Notes Debt Agent has agreed or will agree that if it shall obtain possession of any ABL Collateral
or shall realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such Collateral, pursuant to any security document or
by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding
or through any other exercise of remedies, at any time prior to the associated discharge of ABL Obligations
secured, or intended to be secured, by such Collateral, then it shall hold such Collateral, proceeds or payment in
trust for the ABL Secured Parties and transfer such Collateral, proceeds or payment, as the case may be, to the
ABL Agent reasonably promptly after receiving written notice from the ABL Secured Parties that it has
possession of such Collateral or proceeds or payments in respect thereof.

In addition to the foregoing, the ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Grantors will not, and
will not permit their Subsidiaries to, grant any new Lien to the Notes Collateral Agent or any other Pari Notes
Debt Agent on any of their property unless such Grantor or, as the case may be, such Subsidiary, has granted (or
offered to grant with a reasonable opportunity for such Lien to be accepted) a Lien on such property in favor of
the ABL Collateral Agent for the benefit of the ABL Secured Parties as security for the ABL Obligations, with
the priorities set forth in the ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement. To the extent that any Collateral is subject to a
Lien securing the Obligations under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Indenture and is not subject to a Lien
securing the ABL Obligations, the Notes Collateral Agent will (x) hold and be deemed to have held such Lien
and security interest on such property for the benefit of the holders of ABL Obligations with respect to such
property as security for the ABL Obligations, or (y) if directed by the holders of the ABL Obligations with
respect to such property constituting ABL Collateral, take any actions that are necessary to make such Lien
subject to the ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement and provide the benefit of such Lien to the holders of the ABL
Obligations with respect to such property. The Grantors will agree to similar provisions regarding additional
Liens on the Notes Collateral, and the ABL Secured Parties will agree to reciprocal limitations and release and
assignment provisions with respect to their rights in the Notes Collateral.

In the event that any of the ABL Obligations shall be paid and such payment or any part thereof shall
subsequently, for whatever reason (including an order or judgment for disgorgement of a preference or other
avoidance under the Bankruptcy Code, or any similar law, or the settlement of any claim in respect thereof), be
required to be returned or repaid, the terms and conditions of the ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement shall be
fully applicable thereto until all such ABL Obligations shall again have been paid in full in cash.

**Agreements with Respect to Bankruptcy, Insolvency or Liquidation Proceedings**

If the Company or any other Grantor becomes subject to a bankruptcy case or any other voluntary or
involuntary insolvency or liquidation proceeding and, as a debtor-in-possession, moves for approval of financing
under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code (“Post-Petition Financing”) or the use of cash collateral under
Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, the ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Noteholder
Secured Parties (and the holders of Credit Agreement Obligations and Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations (if any))
will not raise an objection, and will waive any claim such person may have, to any such financing or to the Liens
on the ABL Collateral securing the same, or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes ABl Collateral or to any
grant of administrative expense priority under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code, unless (i)(A) the ABL
Secured Parties, or ABL Collateral Agent, shall then oppose or object to such Post-Petition Financing or such
Liens or such use of cash collateral, (B) such Liens are neither senior to, nor rank equal with, the ABL Secured
Parties’ Liens upon any property of the estate in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding or (C) such PostPetition Financing shall not provide that cash collateral consisting of ABL Collateral (including ABL Collateral
arising after the commencement of such insolvency proceeding) shall be required to be remitted to the ABL
Agent in accordance with the ABL Debt Documents for permanent application to the ABL Obligations unless
otherwise agreed by the ABL Agent or, (ii) with respect to any Post-Petition Financing provided by the ABL
Secured Parties that is secured by a Lien on the ABL First Priority Collateral that is senior in priority to the Lien
of the Notes Secured Parties on the ABL First Priority Collateral, the aggregate principal amount of such PostPetition Financing, together with the aggregate outstanding amount of pre-petition ABL Obligations then

58


-----

outstanding, does not exceed the Maximum ABL Facility Amount. To the extent such Post-Petition Financing
Liens are senior to, or rank equal with, the ABL Secured Parties’ Liens, each pari Notes Debt Agent will, for
itself and on behalf of the other Pari Notes Debt Secured Parties of the applicable series, subordinate their Liens
on the ABL Collateral to (i) the ABL Secured Parties’ Liens (and all adequate protection liens on the ABL
Collateral granted to the ABL Secured Parties) and the Post-Petition Financing Liens and (ii) any “carve out” for
professional fees and United States Trustee fees and other payments from the ABL Collateral agreed to by the
ABL Collateral Agent, so long as the Pari Notes Debt Secured Parties retain their valid, perfected and unvoidable
Liens on all the ABL Collateral, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of any Insolvency or
Liquidation Proceeding, with the same priority as existed prior to the commencement of the case under the
Bankruptcy Code.

The ABL Secured Parties will agree to reciprocal limitations with respect to any Post-Petition Financing
secured with Liens on the Notes Collateral on a senior basis to those of the ABL Secured Parties; provided that,
the maximum amount of such Post-Petition Financing, together with any remaining Obligations under the Notes,
the Guarantees and the Indenture (and remaining Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations (if any)), does not exceed the
Maximum Note Amount.

Each Pari Notes Debt Secured Party agrees that it will not object to or oppose (i) a sale or other disposition
of any ABL Collateral (or any portion thereof) under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or any other provision
of the Bankruptcy Code if the ABL Secured Parties shall have consented to such sale or disposition of such ABL
Collateral and all secured parties’ Liens will attach to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition with the same
priorities set forth in the ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement or (ii) any lawful exercise by any holder of claims
in respect of any ABL Obligations of the right to credit bid such claims under Section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy
Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or in any sale in foreclosure of ABL Collateral.

**Adequate Protection and Cash Collateral**

The ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Noteholder Secured Parties (and holders of
Credit Agreement Obligations and Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations (if any)) will not oppose (or support the
opposition of any other Person) in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding to (A) any motion or other request by
any ABL Secured Party for adequate protection with respect to ABL Agent’s Liens upon the ABL Collateral,
including any claim of any ABL Secured Party to post-petition interest, fees, or expenses as a result of the ABL
Lien on the ABL Collateral (so long as any post-petition interest, fees, or expenses paid as a result thereof is not
paid from the proceeds of Notes Collateral and is allowable under Section 506(b) of the Bankruptcy Code), a
request for the application of proceeds of ABL Collateral to the ABL Obligations, and request for additional or
replacement Liens on post-petition assets of the same type as the ABL Collateral and/or a superpriority
administrative claim, or (B) any objection by any ABL Secured Party to any motion, relief, action or proceeding
based on such ABL Secured Party claiming a lack of adequate protection with respect to the ABL Liens in the
ABL Collateral. In addition, the ABL Agent, for itself and on behalf of the ABL Secured Parties, may seek
adequate protection of its junior interest in the Notes Collateral in the form of an additional or replacement Lien
on post-petition assets of the same type as the Notes Collateral and/or a superpriority administrative claim,
subject to the provisions of this Agreement; provided that each Pari Debt Notes Agent is also granted adequate
protection in the same form that is granted to the ABL Agent, which additional or replacement Lien on postpetition assets of the same type as the Notes Collateral or superpriority administrative claim (as applicable) is
senior to that granted to the ABL Agent in respect of the Notes Collateral. Such Lien on post-petition assets of
the same type as the Notes Collateral and/or superpriority administrative claim, if granted to the ABL Agent, will
be subordinated to the adequate protection Liens and/or superpriority administrative claims (as applicable)
granted in favor of each Pari Notes Debt Agent on such post-petition assets, and, if applicable, to the DIP
Financing Liens of each Pari Notes Debt Agent or any other Pari Notes Debt Secured Party on such post-petition
assets of the same type as the Notes Collateral. If the ABL Agent, for itself and on behalf of the ABL Secured
Parties, seeks or requires (or is otherwise granted) adequate protection of its junior interest in the Notes Collateral
in the form of an additional or replacement Lien on post-petition assets of the same type as the Notes Collateral
and/or a superpriority administrative claim, then the ABL Agent, for itself and the ABL Secured Parties, agrees

59


-----

that each Pari Notes Debt Agent shall also be granted an additional or replacement Lien on such post-petition
assets and/or a superpriority administrative claim as adequate protection of its senior interest in the Notes
Collateral and that the ABL Agent’s additional or replacement Lien on post-petition assets of the same type as
the Notes Collateral and/or superpriority administrative claim (as applicable) shall be subordinated to the
additional or replacement Lien on post-petition assets of the same type as the Notes Collateral and/or
superpriority administrative claim of each Pari Notes Debt Agent on the same basis as the Liens of the ABL
Agent on, and claims with respect to, the Notes Collateral are subordinated to the Liens of each Pari Notes Debt
Agent on, and claims with respect to, the Notes Collateral under this Agreement. If the ABL Agent or any ABL
Secured Party receives as adequate protection a Lien on post-petition assets of the same type as the ABL
Collateral, then such post-petition assets shall also constitute ABL Collateral to the extent of any allowed claim
of the ABL Secured Parties secured by such adequate protection Lien and shall be subject to this Agreement.

**Refinancings of and Amendments to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Notes and Other Pari Passu**
**Lien Obligations**

Subject to the limitations set forth in the Indenture, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities may be amended,
renewed, replaced, exchanged, extended, modified or supplemented from time to time in any manner, all without
affecting the subordination of the Liens in favor of the Noteholder Secured Parties and the other Pari Notes Debt
Secured Parties relative to the Liens in favor of the ABL Secured Parties.

**Pari Passu Intercreditor Arrangements**

The Notes Collateral Agent will join the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, which Pari Passu Intercreditor
Agreement may be amended as necessary in the event that additional permitted Other Pari Passu Lien
Obligations are incurred. The term “Collateral” as used in the description of the Pari Passu Intercreditor
Agreement shall mean the Collateral on which the collateral agents of two or more classes of Indebtedness
having Pari Passu Lien Priority have a valid and perfected Lien. Under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement,
the Holders will be represented by the Notes Collateral Agent, the holders of the Credit Agreement Obligations
will be represented by the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent and the holders of each class of Other Pari Passu
Lien Obligations will be represented by their designated agent (each, an “Authorized Representative”). The Pari
Passu Intercreditor Agreement provides for the priorities and other relative rights among the Holders, the holders
of the Credit Agreement Obligations and the holders of the Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations, including, among
other things, that:

(1) notwithstanding the date, time, method, manner or order of grant, attachment or perfection of any Liens
on the Collateral securing the Notes, the Credit Agreement Obligations and the Other Pari Passu Lien
Obligations, the Liens securing all such Indebtedness shall be of equal priority; and

(2) the Obligations in respect of the Notes, the Credit Agreement Obligations and the Other Pari Passu Lien
Obligations may be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, refunded,
refinanced or otherwise amended from time to time, in each case, to the extent permitted by the Indenture, the
Credit Agreement and the documentation governing the Other Pari Passu Lien Obligations.

(3) The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement also provides that only the “Applicable Authorized
_Representative” will have the right to direct foreclosures and take other actions with respect to the Collateral. The_
Notes Collateral Agent (or any other Applicable Authorized Representative) will be the Applicable Authorized
Representative until such time as either (i) the Notes Obligations (or the applicable class of Indebtedness having
Pari Passu Lien Priority represented by the then-Applicable Authorized Representative) do not represent the
largest class of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority (determined based on the aggregate principal
amount of such Indebtedness then outstanding or the aggregate accreted amount of such Indebtedness with
respect to any such Indebtedness issued at a discount) (a “Larger Holder Event”) or (ii) the occurrence of a NonControlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date (such earlier date, the “Applicable Authorized Agent
_Change Date”). Following the Applicable Authorized Agent Change Date, either (x) in the event that a Larger_

60


-----

Holder Event has occurred, the designated agent under the largest class of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien
Priority or (y) in the event that a Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date has occurred, the
Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative, will become the Applicable Authorized Representative.

As of any date, the “Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative” is the Authorized Representative of
the largest class of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority then-outstanding (other than the same class as
the class of Indebtedness represented by then Applicable Authorized Representative). The “Non-Controlling
_Authorized Representative Enforcement Date” is the date that is 90 days (throughout which 90-day period the_
applicable Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative) after the
occurrence of both (a) an event of default under the terms of the class of Indebtedness represented by such
Authorized Representative and (b) the Notes Collateral Agent’s and each other Authorized Representative’s
receipt of written notice from that Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such Authorized Representative is
the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and that an event of default with respect to the class of
Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority represented by the Major Non-Controlling Authorized
Representative has occurred and is continuing and (ii) such class of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority
is currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with
the terms of that class of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority; provided, however, that the NonControlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be stayed and shall not occur and shall be deemed
not to have occurred with respect to any Collateral (1) at any time the Applicable Authorized Representative has
commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such Collateral with reasonable
diligence in light of the then-existing circumstances or (2) at any time the Company or any other Grantor that has
granted a security interest in such Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any
insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

Only the Applicable Collateral Agent will and will have the right to exercise, or refrain from exercising, any
rights, remedies and powers with respect to the Collateral, including any action to enforce their respective
security interest in or realize upon any Collateral and any right, remedy or power with respect to any Collateral
under any intercreditor agreement (other than the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement), and then only on the
instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative, (ii) the Applicable Collateral Agent shall not be
required to, and shall not, follow any instructions or directions with respect to Collateral (including with respect
to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Collateral) from any Non-Controlling Secured Party, it being
understood and agreed that, notwithstanding any such instruction or direction by the Applicable Authorized
Representative, the Applicable Collateral Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion, could
expose such collateral agent to liability or be contrary to any security document or applicable law, and (iii) no
Non-Controlling Secured Party shall, or shall instruct the Applicable Collateral Agent to, commence any judicial
or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar
official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, take any other action to enforce its
security interest in or realize upon, or exercise any other right, remedy or power with respect to (including any
right, remedy or power under any intercreditor agreement other than the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement) any
Collateral, whether under any credit document, applicable law or otherwise, it being agreed that only the
Applicable Collateral Agent, acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative and in
accordance with the applicable security documents, shall be entitled to take any such actions or exercise any such
rights, remedies and powers with respect to Collateral. Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens
established under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, the Applicable Collateral Agent (acting on the
instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative) may deal with the Collateral as if such collateral agent
had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No Non-Controlling Secured Party will contest, protest or object to any
foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Applicable Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized
Representative or any Controlling Secured Party, or any other exercise by the Applicable Collateral Agent, the
Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party of any rights, remedies or powers with
respect to the Collateral, or seek to cause either Collateral Agent to do so. “Applicable Collateral Agent” means,
at any time with respect to any Collateral, the Collateral Agent of the same class as the Authorized
Representative that is the Applicable Authorized Representative with respect to such Collateral at such time.

61


-----

“Controlling Secured Parties” means, at any time with respect to any Collateral, the Secured Parties of the same
Class as the Authorized Representative that is the Applicable Authorized Representative with respect to such
Collateral at such time. “Non-Controlling Secured Parties” means, at any time with respect to any Collateral, the
Secured Parties that are not Controlling Secured Parties at such time with respect to such Collateral.

If (i) an event of default has occurred and is continuing under any Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien
Priority, and any Authorized Representative or Pari Notes Debt Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in
respect of any Collateral, (ii) any distribution is made with respect to any Collateral in any bankruptcy case of the
Company or any other Grantor or (iii) any Authorized Representative or Pari Notes Debt Secured Party receives
any payment with respect to any Collateral pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the Pari Passu
Intercreditor Agreement), the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Collateral by any
Authorized Representative or Pari Notes Debt Secured Party on account of such enforcement of rights or exercise
of remedies, and any such distributions or payments received by Authorized Representative or Pari Notes Debt
Secured Party, will be applied among the Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority to the payment in full of
all such Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to
the Notes Collateral Agent, any other collateral agent with respect to Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien
Priority and the other Authorized Representatives, in their capacities as such. None of the holders of
Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority may institute any suit or assert in any suit or other proceeding any
claim against the Notes Collateral Agent, any other collateral agent with respect to Indebtedness having Pari
Passu Lien Priority or any other holder of Pari Passu Indebtedness seeking damages from or other relief by way
of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Collateral. In addition, none of the holders
of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority may seek to have any Collateral or any part thereof marshaled
upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any holder of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien
Priority obtains possession of any Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof, in each case,
as a result of the enforcement of remedies, at any time prior to the discharge of each of such Indebtedness, then it
must hold such Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other holders of Indebtedness having Pari Passu
Lien Priority and promptly transfer such Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Applicable Authorized
Representative to be distributed in accordance with the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement

The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement provides that the the holders of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien
Priority of each class (and not the the holders of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of any other class)
bear the risk of (a) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (i) any Indebtedness having Pari
Passu Lien Priority of such class is unenforceable under applicable Law or is subordinated to any other
obligations (other than to any Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of any other class), (ii) any
Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of such class does not have a valid and perfected Lien on any of the
Collateral securing any Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of any other class and/or (iii) any person
(other than any Authorized Representative or any holder of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority) has a
Lien on any Collateral that is senior in priority to the Lien on such Collateral securing Indebtedness having Pari
Passu Lien Priority of such Class, but junior to the Lien on such Collateral securing any Indebtedness having Pari
Passu Lien Priority of any other Class (any such Lien being referred to as an “Intervening Lien”, and any such
Person being referred to as an “Intervening Creditor”), or (b) the existence of any Collateral securing
Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of any other class that does not constitute Collateral with respect to
Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of such class (any condition referred to in clause (a) or (b) with
respect to Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of such class being referred to as an “Impairment” of
such class). In the event an Impairment exists with respect to Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien Priority of any
class, the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of Indebtedness having Pari Passu Lien
Priority of such class, and the rights of such holders (including the right to receive distributions in accordance
with the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement) shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the results of such
Impairment are borne solely by such holders.

62


-----

**Release of Collateral**

The Company and the Guarantors will be entitled to the releases of property and other assets included in the
Collateral from the Liens securing the Notes under any one or more of the following circumstances:

   - to enable the sale or other disposition of such property or assets, including Capital Stock (other than to the
Company or a Guarantor), to the extent not prohibited under the covenant described under “—Repurchase
at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales;”

   - in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee, the release of the property and assets of
such Guarantor;

   - to the extent such Collateral is comprised of property leased to the Company or a Guarantor, upon
termination or expiration of such lease;

   - with respect to Collateral that is Capital Stock, upon the dissolution or liquidation of the issuer of that
Capital Stock that is not prohibited by the Indenture;

   - with respect to any Collateral that becomes an “Excluded Asset” or that becomes subject to certain
Permitted Liens; or

  - as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” below.

In the event of a sale, transfer or other disposition of the ABL Collateral or any such ABL Collateral
becoming excluded collateral under the ABL Debt Documents (regardless of whether or not an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing under the Notes Documents at the time of such sale, transfer or other disposition
or any such ABL Collateral becoming excluded collateral under the ABL Debt Documents), the Lien on such
ABL Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees will terminate and be released automatically and without
further action if the Liens of the ABL Agent on such Collateral are released and if such sale, transfer or other
disposition either (A) is then not prohibited by the Notes Documents or (B) occurs in connection with the
foreclosure upon or other exercise of rights and remedies with respect to such ABL Collateral (including, in
connection with any liquidation of ABL Collateral consented to by the ABL Agent); provided that such Lien
securing the Notes and the Guarantees shall remain in place with respect to any proceeds of a sale, transfer or
other disposition under this clause (a) that remain after the associated discharge of ABL Obligations. In addition,
for the avoidance of doubt, the Junior Representative and each Junior Secured Obligations Secured Party agree
that, with respect to any property or assets that would otherwise constitute Senior Secured Obligations Collateral,
the requirement that a Junior Lien attach to, or be perfected with respect to, such property or assets shall be
waived automatically and without further action so long as the requirement that a Senior Lien attach to, or be
perfected with respect to, such property or assets is waived by the Senior Secured Obligations Secured Parties (or
the Senior Representative) in accordance with the Senior Documents and so long as no Event of Default under
the Junior Documents shall have occurred, be continuing or would result therefrom at such time. The first
priority Liens on the Notes Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees shall also terminate and be released
automatically in connection with a sale, transfer or disposition of Notes Collateral that occurs in connection with
the foreclosure of, or other exercise of remedies with respect to, Notes Collateral by any collateral agent under
the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement (except with respect to the proceeds of such sale, transfer or disposition).

The security interests in all Collateral securing the Notes also will be released upon (i) payment in full of the
principal of, together with accrued and unpaid interest on, the Notes and all other obligations (other than
contingent indemnity obligations for which no demand has been made) under the Indenture, the Guarantees
under the Indenture and the Collateral Documents that are due and payable at or prior to the time such principal,
together with accrued and unpaid interest, is paid, or (ii) a legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the
Indenture as described below under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or a discharge of the
Indenture as described under “—Satisfaction and Discharge.”

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below, the Notes are not redeemable at the option of the Company.

At any time prior to, 2019, the Company may redeem the Notes in whole or in part, at its
option, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of such Notes plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest to the
redemption date.

At any time and from time to time on or after, 2019, the Company may redeem the Notes in
whole or in part upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to the
percentage of principal amount set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes redeemed,
to, but excluding, the applicable date of redemption, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning
on of the year indicated below:

At any time and from time to time prior to, 2019, the Company may redeem Notes with the net
cash proceeds received by the Company from any Equity Offering at a redemption price equal to % plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, in an aggregate principal amount for all such
redemptions not to exceed 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including Additional
Notes); provided that

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related Equity
Offering, and

(2) not less than 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued under the Indenture
remains outstanding immediately thereafter (excluding Notes held by the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries).

In addition, at any time and from time to time during the 36 month period following the Issue Date, the
Company may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued under the Indenture
(including any Additional Notes) during each twelve-month period beginning on the Issue Date at a redemption
price of 103% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes
redeemed, to, but excluding, the applicable date of redemption.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Notes, including a Change of
Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Company, or any
third party making a such tender offer in lieu of the Company, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn by such Holders, the Company or such third party will have the right upon not less than 15 nor more
than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 15 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes that
remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price equal to the price offered to each other Holder
in such tender offer plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, thereon, to, but not including, the date of such redemption.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

Notice of any redemption of the Notes may, at the Company’s discretion, be given prior to the completion
of a corporate transaction (including an Equity Offering, an incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of Control or

64


-----

other corporate transaction) and any redemption notice may, at the Company’s discretion, be subject to one or
more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a related transaction. If such redemption
or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such
condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Company’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed
until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption or purchase may not occur and
such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the
redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed. In addition, the Company may provide in such notice
that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Company’s obligations with respect to such
redemption may be performed by another Person.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to the redemption date will be paid to the Person in whose name
the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to
Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Company.

Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund**

The Company is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to offer to purchase
Notes as described under the captions “—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of
Assets and Subsidiary Stock.” The Company may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes in the open
market or otherwise.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select the Notes for redemption
in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed, as
certified to the Trustee by the Company, and in compliance with the requirements of DTC, or if the Notes are not
so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Notes are not held through DTC or DTC
prescribes no method of selection, on a pro rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Note in an unauthorized
denomination remains outstanding after such redemption; provided, however, that no Note of $2,000 in aggregate
principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least 15 days but not
more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at the address of such
Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC,
except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption
date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the
Indenture.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the
portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Note will be
issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a global note, an
appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to
the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any
conditions contained therein), Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and
after the redemption date, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to
accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

65


-----

**Change of Control**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless the Company has previously or
substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as
described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Company will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant
to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate
principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase, subject
to the right of Holders of the Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company will deliver or cause to be
delivered notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the procedures of DTC or by
first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the
security register, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to
repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no
earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures
required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control
Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the
Indenture by virtue thereof. The Company may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the
staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions
that permit the Holders of the Notes to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a
takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the
Credit Agreement and the ABL that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder and
would also likely require the Company to offer to repurchase the Existing Unsecured Notes. Future Indebtedness
of the Company or its subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change
of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by
the holders of their right to require the Company to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such
Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the
Company. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required
repurchases.

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be
limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary
to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain
circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent
management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of
the Notes and us. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control after the
Issue Date, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including
acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the
Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our
capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the
covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such

66


-----

covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the
Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a
third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and
purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of
redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the
caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on
the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent
contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a
Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of
Control.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable
law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and
whether a Holder of Notes may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described
above.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture.

**Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status**

Following the first day:

(a) the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture,

then, beginning on that day and continuing until the Reversion Date (as defined below), the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following
headings (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

   - “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

   - “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

   - “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

   - “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

   - “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

   - “—Limitation on Guarantees”; and

   - the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Amalgamation and Consolidation.”

67


-----

If at any time the Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status, then the Suspended Covenants will
thereafter be reinstated as if such covenants had never been suspended (the “Reversion Date”) and be applicable
pursuant to the terms of the Indenture (including in connection with performing any calculation or assessment to
determine compliance with the terms of the Indenture), unless and until the Notes subsequently attain Investment
Grade Status and no Default or Event of Default is in existence (in which event the Suspended Covenants shall
no longer be in effect for such time that the Notes maintain an Investment Grade Status); provided, however, that
no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the
Note Guarantees with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on, and none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for, any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period (as
defined below), or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising prior to the
Reversion Date, regardless of whether such actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable
Suspended Covenants remained in effect during such period. The period of time between the date of suspension
of the covenants and the Reversion Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period.”

On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been
outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of
“—Limitation on Indebtedness.” On and after the Reversion Date, all Liens created during the Suspension Period
will be considered Permitted Liens. Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be
made as Restricted Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be made as though the covenants
described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect since the Issue Date and prior to, but
not during, the Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not
reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of “—Limitation on
Restricted Payments.” On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Any Affiliate
Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension
Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under
clause (6) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.” Any encumbrance or
restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (A) through (C) of
the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes
effective during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have existed on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as
permitted under clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from
Restricted Subsidiaries.” In addition, any future obligation to grant further Guarantees shall be released. All such
further obligation to grant Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date.

On and after each Reversion Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the
transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such contract
and such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status.

The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes, shall not be deemed to have any
knowledge of the ratings of the Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Notes achieve Investment
Grade Status.

**Limitation on Indebtedness**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Company and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro
forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries is greater than 2.00 to 1.00; provided, further, that NonGuarantors may not Incur Indebtedness under this paragraph if, after giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence
(including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), more than an aggregate of the greater of

68


-----

(a) $300.0 million and (b) 75% of LTM EBITDA of Indebtedness of Non-Guarantors would be outstanding
pursuant to this paragraph at such time.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness
(collectively, “Permitted Debt”):

(1) (X) Indebtedness Incurred under any Credit Facility (other than the ABL) by the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (including letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or created under any
Credit Facility) and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness, up to an aggregate principal amount
equal to the sum of (I) the greater of (a) $600.0 million and (b) the maximum amount of Indebtedness that
the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries could incur such that either (i) in the case of Indebtedness
with Pari Passu Lien Priority relative to the Notes, the Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio is equal to
or less than 4.00 to 1.00 on a pro forma basis (provided that, for purposes of determining the amount that
may be Incurred under this clause (I)(b)(i), all Indebtedness incurred under this clause (I)(b)(i) shall be
deemed to be secured by Liens) that are not junior to the Liens Securing the Notes or (ii) in the case of
Indebtedness with Junior Lien Priority relative to the Notes or Secured Indebtedness not secured by a
Lien on any Collateral, the Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio is equal to or less than 5.00 to 1.00 on a
pro forma basis (provided that, for the purposes of determining the amount that may be Incurred under
this clause (I)(b)(ii), all Indebtedness incurred under this clause (I)(b) shall be deemed to be secured by
Liens plus (II) $375.0 million, in each case, outstanding at any one time, (Y) Indebtedness Incurred under
the ABL by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (including letters of credit or bankers’
acceptances issued or created under any Credit Facility) and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness,
up to an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time not to exceed the greater of (a) $1,300.0
million and (b) the Borrowing Base as of the date of such incurrence, and (Z) in the case of any
refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount
of fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, premiums (including, without limitation,
tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including, without limitation, original issue discount,
upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing, and any Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof;

(2) Guarantees by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other obligations of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness or other
obligation is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Company owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided,
_however, that:_

(a) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any such
Indebtedness being held by a Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary; and

(b) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary,

shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Company or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) Indebtedness represented by (a) the Notes (other than any Additional Notes), including any Guarantee
thereof, (b) any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clauses (1), (2) and
(4)(a) above) outstanding on the Issue Date (including the Existing Unsecured Notes) and any
Guarantee thereof, (c) Refinancing Indebtedness (including, with respect to the Notes and the Existing
Unsecured Notes, any Guarantee thereof) Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in this
clause or clauses (2), (5) or (8) of this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this
covenant, and (d) Management Advances;

(5) Indebtedness of (x) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurred or issued to finance an
acquisition or (y) Persons that are acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiaries or merged

69


-----

into or consolidated with the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture; provided that such Indebtedness is in an aggregate amount not to exceed (i) the greater
of $100.0 million and 25% of LTM EBITDA at any time outstanding plus (ii) unlimited additional
Indebtedness if after giving effect to such acquisition, merger or consolidation, either

(a) the Company would be permitted to Incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the
first paragraph of this covenant,

(b) either the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries would not
be lower or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries would not be higher, in each case, than immediately prior to such acquisition, merger
or consolidation, or

(c) such Indebtedness constitutes Acquired Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness Incurred in
contemplation of the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person
became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary); provided that the only obligors with respect to such Indebtedness shall be those
Persons who were obligors of such Indebtedness prior to such acquisition, merger or
consolidation;

(6) Hedging Obligations (excluding Hedging Obligations entered into for speculative purposes);

(7) Indebtedness (i) represented by Capitalized Lease Obligations or Purchase Money Obligations in an
aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all
other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause and then outstanding, does not exceed the greater of

against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice; provided,
_however, that such Indebtedness is extinguished within five Business Days of Incurrence; (c) customer_
deposits and advance payments received in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past
practice from customers for goods or services purchased in the ordinary course of business or
consistent with past practice; (d) letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, guarantees or other similar

of business or consistent with past practice; (e) any customary treasury, depositary, cash management,
automatic clearinghouse arrangements, overdraft protections, credit or debit card, purchase card,
electronic funds transfer, cash pooling or netting or setting off arrangements or similar arrangements in
the ordinary course of business; or consistent with past practice; and (f) Settlement Indebtedness;

(9) Indebtedness arising from agreements providing for guarantees, indemnification, obligations in respect
of earn-outs or other adjustments of purchase price or, in each case, similar obligations, in each case,

Person acquiring or disposing of such business or assets or such Subsidiary for the purpose of financing
such acquisition or disposition); provided that the maximum liability of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries in respect of all such Indebtedness in connection with a disposition shall at no time exceed

-----

(10) Indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the
principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause and then outstanding, will
not exceed 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds received by the Company from the issuance or sale (other
than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of its Capital Stock or otherwise contributed to the equity (in each case,
other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock, Designated Preferred Stock or an Excluded
Contribution) of the Company, in each case, subsequent to the Issue Date and any Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof; provided, however, that (i) any such Net Cash Proceeds that are so
received or contributed shall not increase the amount available for making Restricted Payments to the
extent the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries Incur Indebtedness in reliance thereon and (ii) any
Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of Incurring
Indebtedness pursuant to this clause to the extent such Net Cash Proceeds or cash have been applied to
make Restricted Payments;

(11) Indebtedness of Non-Guarantors in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (a) $100.0 million

-----

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) subject to clause (3) below, in the event that all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness meets the
criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of
this covenant, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify,
such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in
the first paragraph above or one of the clauses of the second paragraph of this covenant;

(2) additionally, all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness may later be reclassified as having been
Incurred pursuant to any type of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this
covenant so long as such Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred pursuant to such provision and any
related Liens are permitted to be Incurred at the time of reclassification;

(3) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the Credit Agreement and the ABL shall be
deemed to have been Incurred on the Issue Date under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the
description of this covenant;

(4) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, such Indebtedness shall not include the aggregate amount
of fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, premiums (including, without limitation,
tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including, without limitation, original issue discount,
upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(5) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination
of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(6) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as incurred pursuant to any clause of the
second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or
other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be
included;

(7) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or
repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the
liquidation preference thereof;

(8) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or
more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(9) in the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a
revolving credit facility, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio,
Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as applicable, for
borrowings and reborrowings thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and
bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the Company’s option as elected on the date the Company or
a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, enters into or increases such commitments, either (a) be
determined on the date of such revolving credit facility or such increase in commitments (assuming
that the full amount thereof has been borrowed as of such date), and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio, the Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio or the
Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any
borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’
acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio or
the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as applicable, at the time of any borrowing or reborrowing (or
issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount

permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’
acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness
_Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated First Lien_
Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as
applicable) or (b) be determined on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any such facility or
increased commitment;

(10) in the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (x) incurs Indebtedness to finance an
acquisition or (y) assumes Indebtedness of Persons that are acquired by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary or merged into the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture, the date of determination of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated First Lien
Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as
applicable, shall, at the option of the Company, be the date that a definitive agreement for such
acquisition is entered into and the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated First Lien Leverage
Ratio, Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as applicable,
shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such acquisition and the other transactions to be entered
into in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof)
consistent with the definition of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated First Lien
Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, as
applicable, and, for the avoidance of doubt, (A) if any such ratios are exceeded as a result of
fluctuations in such ratio (including due to fluctuations in the EBITDA of the Company or the target
company) at or prior to the consummation of the relevant acquisition, such ratios will not be deemed to
have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether such
acquisition and any related transactions are permitted hereunder and (B) such ratios shall not be tested
at the time of consummation of such acquisition or related transactions; provided, further, that if the
Company elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement,
(i) any such transaction shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreement is
entered into and to be outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any ratios under the Indenture
after the date of such agreement and before the earlier of the date of consummation of such acquisition
or the date such agreement is terminated or expires without consummation of such acquisition and
(ii) to the extent any covenant baskets were utilized in satisfying any covenants, such baskets shall be
deemed utilized until the earlier of the date of consummation of such acquisition or the date such
agreement is terminated or expires without consummation of such acquisition, but any calculation of
Consolidated EBITDA for purposes of other incurrences of Indebtedness or Liens or making of
Restricted Payments (not related to such acquisition) shall not reflect such acquisition until it has been
consummated;

(11) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness incurred to
refinance Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this
covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such
refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based
on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA
restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing
Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus
premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance, costs and fees in connection with such refinancing;
and

(12) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal
to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of GAAP.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends
in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments

73


-----

or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of
Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.”

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as of such date (and, if
such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this
“—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Company shall be in default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of
Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency
shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was
Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided, that if such
Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing
would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall
be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not
exceed (a) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (b) the aggregate amount of fees,
underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest, premiums (including, without limitation, tender premiums)
and other costs and expenses (including, without limitation, original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees)
Incurred in connection with such refinancing.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded
solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness
Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being
refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such
Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

The Indenture will provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, directly or
indirectly, incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that is subordinated or junior in right of
payment to any Indebtedness of the Company or such Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such Indebtedness is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee to the extent and in
the same manner as such Indebtedness is subordinated to other Indebtedness of the Company or such Guarantor,
as the case may be.

The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness
merely because it is unsecured or (2) senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other senior
Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or is secured by different
collateral or because it is guaranteed by different obligors.

**Limitation on Restricted Payments**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on or in respect of the Company’s or any
Restricted Subsidiary’s Capital Stock (including, without limitation, any such payment in connection
with any merger or consolidation involving the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) except:

(a) dividends or distributions payable in Capital Stock of the Company (other than Disqualified
Stock) or in options, warrants or other rights to purchase such Capital Stock of the Company; or

(b) dividends or distributions payable to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (and, in the case of
the Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary making such dividend or distribution, to holders
of its Capital Stock other than the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary on no more than a
_pro rata basis);_

retirement in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity,
in each case, due within one year of the date of purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other
acquisition or retirement and (b) any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (3) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”); or

(4) make any Restricted Investment;

(any such dividend, distribution, purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, other acquisition, retirement or
Restricted Investment referred to in clauses (1) through (4) are referred to herein as a “Restricted Payment”), if at
the time the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary makes such Restricted Payment:

(a) an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would immediately thereafter result
therefrom);

(b) the Company is not able to Incur an additional $1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first
paragraph under the “—Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant immediately after giving effect, on
a pro forma basis, to such Restricted Payment; or

(c) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments made
subsequent to the July 31, 2015 (and not returned or rescinded) (including Permitted Payments
made pursuant to clauses (1) (without duplication) and (10) of the next succeeding paragraph, but
excluding all other Restricted Payments made pursuant to the next succeeding paragraph) would
exceed the sum (the “Available Amount”) of (without duplication):

(i) $100.0 million;

(ii) 50% of Consolidated Net Income for the period (treated as one accounting period) from
July 1, 2016 to the end of the most recent fiscal quarter ending prior to the date of such
Restricted Payment for which internal consolidated financial statements of the Company are
available (or, in the case such Consolidated Net Income is a deficit, minus 100% of such
deficit);

(iii) 100% of the aggregate cash, and the fair market value of property or assets or marketable
securities, received by the Company from the issue or sale of its Capital Stock or as the result
of a merger or consolidation with another Person subsequent to the Issue Date, or otherwise
contributed to the equity (other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock or Designated
Preferred Stock) of the Company subsequent to the Issue Date (other than (x) Net Cash
Proceeds or property or assets or marketable securities received from an issuance or sale of
such Capital Stock to a Restricted Subsidiary or an employee stock ownership plan or trust
established by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company for the benefit of its
employees to the extent funded by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, (y) cash or

good faith by the Company, of marketable securities or other property received by means of:

Restricted Investments made by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries and repurchases
and redemptions of such Restricted Investments from the Company or its Restricted
Subsidiaries and repayments of loans or advances, and releases of guarantees, which
constitute Restricted Investments by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case
after the Issue Date; or (ii) the sale (other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) of
the stock of an Unrestricted Subsidiary or a distribution from an Unrestricted Subsidiary
(other than to the extent of the amount of the Investment that constituted a Permitted
Investment or was made under clause (17) of the next succeeding paragraph and will increase
the amount available under the applicable clause of the definition of “Permitted Investment”
or clause (17) of the next succeeding, as the case may be) or a dividend from an Unrestricted
Subsidiary after the Issue Date; and

(vi) in the case of the redesignation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary or

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit any of the following (collectively, “Permitted Payments”):

(1) the payment of any dividend or distribution within 60 days after the date of declaration thereof, if at the
date of declaration such payment would have complied with the provisions of the Indenture or the
redemption, repurchase or retirement of Indebtedness if, at the date of any redemption notice, such
payment would have complied with the provisions of the Indenture as if it were and is deemed at such
time to be a Restricted Payment at the time of such notice;

(2) (a) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of Capital
Stock (“Treasury Capital Stock”) or Subordinated Indebtedness made by exchange (including any such

(x) $65.0 million and (y) 20% of LTM EBITDA at the time of such redemption, defeasance,

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment (or
portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments described in clauses
(1) through (19) above, or is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or one or more of the
clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,” the Company will be entitled to classify such
Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify (based on
circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion
thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant, including as an Investment pursuant to one or more of
the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments.”

79


-----

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of such
Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Company or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of
any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted
Payment, property or assets other than cash shall be determined conclusively by the Company acting in good
faith.

**Limitation on Liens**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur
or suffer to exist any Lien (except Permitted Liens) (each, a “Subject Lien”) that secures Obligations under any
Indebtedness on any asset or property of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, except for in the case of
Subject Liens on any other asset or property that does not constitute Collateral, any Subject Lien, if the Notes and
the Guarantees are equally and ratably secured with (or on a senior basis to, in the case such Subject Lien secures
any Subordinated Indebtedness) the Obligations secured by such Subject Lien.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes pursuant of the preceding paragraph may
provide by its terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the
release and discharge of the Subject Lien that gave rise to the obligation to so secure the Notes and the
Guarantees (which release and discharge in the case of any sale of any such asset or property shall not affect any
Lien that the Notes Collateral Agent may otherwise have on the proceeds from such sale).

Any reference to a “Permitted Lien” is not intended to subordinate or postpone, and shall not be interpreted
as subordinating or postponing, or as any agreement to subordinate or postpone, any Lien in favor of the Notes
Collateral Agent in respect of the Notes Collateral or the ABL Collateral.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time
of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of
property securing Indebtedness.

**Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit
to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any
Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to_
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to
constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility, (b) the Existing Unsecured Notes or
(c) any other agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date;

(4) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating to any

acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which such agreement or
instrument is assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition
of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any
portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to
which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Company or was merged,
consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or entered
into in contemplation of or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided
that, for the purposes of this clause, if another Person is the Successor Company, any Subsidiary
thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or
assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor
Company;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset
that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract or agreement, or the assignment or transfer of
any lease, license or other contract or agreement;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under the
Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the
Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer or encumbrance of
the property or assets subject to such mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in any
reciprocal easement agreements of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease
Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or restrictions on

-----

(12) other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of Foreign Subsidiaries permitted to be
Incurred or issued subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” that impose restrictions solely on the Foreign Subsidiaries party
thereto or their Subsidiaries;

(13) restrictions created in connection with any Receivables Facility that, in the good faith determination of
the Company, are necessary or advisable to effect such Receivables Facility;

(14) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any
Indebtedness, shall only be permitted if such Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the
Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”
if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a
whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in the Credit Agreement, together with the security documents associated therewith as in
effect on the Issue Date or (ii) in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Company)
and where, in the case of clause (ii), either (a) the Company determines at the time of entry into such
agreement or instrument that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any
material respect, the Company’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes or (b) such
encumbrance or restriction applies only during the continuance of a default relating to such agreement
or instrument;

(15) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under “—Limitation on Liens”;
or

(16) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to
in clauses (1) to (15) of this paragraph or this clause (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any
amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clauses (1) to (15) of this
paragraph or this clause (16); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to
such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any
material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in
the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or
other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Company).

**Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition
unless:

(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by
way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or
otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date of
contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Company, of the
shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset Disposition,
together with all other Asset Dispositions since the Issue Date (on a cumulative basis) (including by
way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or
otherwise), received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form
of cash or Cash Equivalents; and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied:

(a) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is required
by the terms of any Indebtedness), (i) to prepay, repay or purchase any Indebtedness of a Non
82


-----

Guarantor (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary) or any Secured Indebtedness, including Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement or
ABL (or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) within 450 days from the later of
(A) the date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided,
_however, that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness_
pursuant to this clause (i), the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such
Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) to be reduced in an amount equal to
the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased; or (ii) to prepay, repay or purchase
Indebtedness with Pari Passu Lien Priority relative to the Notes; provided further that, to the
extent the Company redeems, repays or repurchases such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (ii),
the Company shall equally and ratably reduce Obligations under the Notes as provided under “—
Optional Redemption,” through open-market purchases (to the extent such purchases are at or
above 100% of the principal amount thereof) or by making an offer (in accordance with the
procedures set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes at
100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on
the amount of Notes that would otherwise be prepaid; provided further, that, notwithstanding to
the foregoing, the Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition of Collateral may not be applied
pursuant to clause (i) of this paragraph to prepay, repay or purchase any unsecured Indebtedness
or Indebtedness with Junior Lien Priority in respect of the Collateral relative to the Notes;

(b) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to invest in
Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted
Subsidiary equal to the amount of Net Available Cash received by the Company or another
Restricted Subsidiary) within 450 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and
(ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that a binding agreement shall be
treated as a permitted application of Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment with
the good faith expectation that an amount equal to Net Available Cash will be applied to satisfy
such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an “Acceptable Commitment”) and, in the
event of any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such
amount is applied in connection therewith, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into
another Acceptable Commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within 180 days of such cancellation
or termination; provided further that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated
for any reason before such amount is applied, then such Net Available Cash shall constitute
Excess Proceeds; and

(c) if such Asset Disposition involves the disposition of Collateral, the Company or such Subsidiary
has complied with the provisions of the Indenture and the Collateral Documents.

_provided that, pending the final application of the amount of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with_
clause (a) or clause (b) above, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness
or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

The amount of any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed
to be applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds”
under the Indenture. On the 451st day after the later of an Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available
Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the Indenture exceeds $100.0 million, the Company will
within 10 Business Days be required to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders of Notes issued
under such Indenture and, to the extent the Company elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu
Indebtedness with Pari Passu Lien Priority in respect of the Collateral relative to the Notes, to purchase the
maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer
applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount
equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth

83


-----

in the Indenture or the agreements governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and, with respect to the
Notes, in minimum denominations of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Company
will deliver notice of such Asset Disposition Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the
Trustee, the Paying Agent and each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security
register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, describing the transaction or
transactions that constitute the Asset Disposition and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase
price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from
the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such
notice. The Company may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an
Asset Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to all Net Available Cash prior to the
expiration of the relevant 450 days (or such longer period provided above) or with respect to any unapplied
Excess Proceeds.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness with Pari Passu Lien Priority in
respect of the collateral relative to the Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset
Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Company may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any
purpose not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset
Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness with Pari Passu Lien Priority in respect of the
collateral relative to the Notes surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess
Proceeds, the Company shall allocate the Excess Proceeds among the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be
purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and such Pari Passu
Indebtedness provided that no Notes or other such Pari Passu Indebtedness will be selected and purchased in an
unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall
be reset at zero. Additionally, the Company may, at its option, make an Asset Disposition Offer using proceeds from
any Asset Disposition at any time after the consummation of such Asset Disposition. Upon consummation or
expiration of any Asset Disposition Offer, any remaining Net Available Cash shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds
and the Company may use such Net Available Cash for any purpose not prohibited by the Indenture.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a
currency other than U.S. dollars, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes shall not exceed the net
amount of funds in U.S. dollars that is actually received by the Company upon converting such portion into U.S.
dollars.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Net Available
Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Foreign Subsidiary (a “Foreign Disposition”) is (x) prohibited or delayed by
applicable local law, (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents or any agreement or (z) subject to
other onerous organizational or administrative impediments from being repatriated to the United States, the
portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this
covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary so long, but only so long, as
the applicable local law documents or agreements will not permit repatriation to the United States (the Company
hereby agreeing to use reasonable efforts (as determined in the Company’s reasonable business judgment) to
otherwise cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary to within one year following the date on which the respective
payment would otherwise have been required, promptly take all actions reasonably required by the applicable
local law, applicable organizational impediments or other impediment to permit such repatriation), and if within
one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required such
repatriation of any of such affected Net Available Cash is permitted under the applicable local law, applicable
organizational impediment or other impediment, such repatriation will be promptly effected and such repatriated
Net Available Cash will be promptly (and in any event not later than five (5) Business Days after such
repatriation could be made) applied (net of additional Taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof)
(whether or not such repatriation actually occurs) in compliance with this covenant and (ii) to the extent that the
Company has determined in good faith that repatriation of any of or all the Net Available Cash of any Foreign
Disposition would have an adverse Tax consequence (which for the avoidance of doubt, includes, but is not
limited to, any prepayment whereby doing so the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary, or any of their respective

84


-----

affiliates and/or equity owners would incur a tax liability, including a tax dividend, deemed dividend pursuant to
Code Section 956 or a withholding tax, the Net Available Cash so affected may be retained by the applicable
Foreign Subsidiary. The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing
provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be
cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or a
Guarantor) and the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such
Indebtedness or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into
cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such
Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released
from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company (other than Subordinated Indebtedness)
received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in
such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated
Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to
exceed the greater of $125.0 million and 4.0% of Total Assets (with the fair market value of each item
of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect
to subsequent changes in value).

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable
securities laws, rules and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the
Indenture by virtue thereof.

The provisions of the Indenture relative to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes.

The Credit Agreement and ABL may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to
which the Company becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Company from purchasing any Notes pursuant to
this covenant. In the event the Company is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Company could seek the
consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such
prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited
from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Company’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an
Event of Default under the Indenture.

**Limitation on Affiliate Transactions**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to enter into or conduct any
transaction (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with
any Affiliate of the Company (an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of $25.0 million,
unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Company
or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable transaction

85


-----

at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction in arm’s length
dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of $50.0 million, the terms
of such transaction have been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (2) of this
paragraph if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors, if any.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation
on Restricted Payments,” or any Permitted Investment;

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or other
payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering
into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation
arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Company, any
Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Entity, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock
appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans
(including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or
similar plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees,
directors or consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the Company, in each case in the
ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) (a) any transaction between or among the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted
Subsidiaries and (b) any merger, amalgamation or consolidation with any Parent Entity, provided that
such Parent Entity shall have no material liabilities and no material assets other than cash, Cash
Equivalents and the Capital Stock of the Company and such merger, amalgamation or consolidation is
otherwise consummated in compliance with the Indenture;

(5) the payment of compensation, fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities
(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided
on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Company, any Parent Entity or any
Restricted Subsidiary (whether directly or indirectly and including through any Controlled Investment
Affiliate of such directors, officers or employees);

(6) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of
funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date, as these agreements and
instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed or refinanced from time to
time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to
the Holders in any material respect;

(7) sales of accounts receivable, or participations therein, in connection with any Receivables Facility;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, joint venture partners, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods
or services, in each case in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice, which are
fair to the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board
of Directors or the senior management of the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on
terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an
unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction between or among the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Person that is an
Affiliate of the Company or an Associate or similar entity solely because the Company or a Restricted

86


-----

Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted
Holder owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(10) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preferred Stock) of the
Company or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock and the granting of
registration and other customary rights in connection therewith or any contribution to capital of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(11) (a) payments by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly
or indirectly) of annual management, consulting, monitoring, refinancing, subsequent transaction exit
fees, advisory fees and related costs and expenses and indemnitees in connection therewith in an
aggregate amount not to exceed 2.5% of LTM EBITDA and (b) customary payments by the Company
or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including through
any Parent Entity) for financial advisory, financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect of
other investment banking activities, including in connection with acquisitions or divestitures, which
payments are approved by a majority of the Board of Directors in good faith;

(12) payment to any Permitted Holder of all out of pocket expenses Incurred by such Permitted Holder in
connection with its direct or indirect investment in the Company and its Subsidiaries;

(13) (a) the Acquisition Transactions and the payment of all costs and expenses (including all legal,
accounting and other professional fees and expenses) related to the Acquisition Transactions and (b)
the Transactions and the payment of all costs and expenses (including all legal, accounting and other
professional fees and expenses) related to the Transactions, in each case as disclosed in this offering
circular;

(14) transactions in which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, delivers to the
Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the requirements of
clause (1) of the preceding paragraph;

(15) the existence of, or the performance by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiaries of its obligations
under the terms of, any equityholders agreement (including any registration rights agreement or
purchase agreements related thereto) to which it is party as of the Issue Date and any similar agreement
that it may enter into thereafter; provided, however, that the existence of, or the performance by the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of its obligations under any future amendment to the
equityholders’ agreement or under any similar agreement entered into after the Issue Date will only be
permitted under this clause to the extent that the terms of any such amendment or new agreement are
not otherwise disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect;

(16) any purchase by the Company’s Affiliates of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of the Company or
any of their Restricted Subsidiaries the majority of which Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock is
purchased by Persons who are not the Company’s Affiliates; provided that such purchases by the
Company’s Affiliates are on the same terms as such purchases by such Persons who are not the
Company’s Affiliates;

(17) (i) investments by Affiliates in securities of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (and
payment of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Affiliates in connection therewith) so
long as the investment is being offered by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary generally to
other non-affiliated third party investors on the same or more favorable terms and (ii) payments to
Affiliates in respect of securities of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries contemplated in
the foregoing subclause (i) or that were acquired from Persons other than the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case, in accordance with the terms of such securities;

(18) payments by the Company (and any Parent Entity) and its Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to any tax

respective Controlled Investment Affiliates or Immediate Family Members) of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its direct or indirect parent companies pursuant to any management equity plan
or stock option plan or any other management or employee benefit plan or agreement or any stock
subscription or shareholder agreement; and any employment agreements, stock option plans and other
compensatory arrangements (and any successor plans thereto) and any supplemental executive

are, in each case, approved by the board of directors of the Company in good faith;

(20) employment and severance arrangements between the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries and their
respective offers and employees in the ordinary course of business;

(21) any transition services arrangement, supply arrangement or similar arrangement entered into in
connection with or in contemplation of the disposition of assets or Equity Interests in any Restricted

Unrestricted Subsidiary is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary as described under the caption
“—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries”; and

(23) any Permitted Tax Restructuring.

**Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

The Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation
would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate
fair market value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the
Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of
the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the covenant described above
under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or under one or more clauses of
the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Company. That designation will only be permitted
if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition
of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The Company may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted
Subsidiary if that redesignation would not cause a Default.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of the Company as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the
Trustee by an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the preceding conditions and
was permitted by the covenant described above under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Restricted Payments.” If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements
as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the
Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of
the Company as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under the
covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Company will be
in default of such covenant.

The Company may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such
designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under the
caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” (including pursuant to clause 5(b) thereof treating

such redesignation as an acquisition for the purpose of such clause) calculated on a pro forma basis as if such
designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of
Default would be in existence following such designation. Any such designation by the Company shall be
evidenced to the Trustee by an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the preceding
conditions.

**Reports**

Notwithstanding that the Company may not be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d)
of the Exchange Act or otherwise report on an annual and quarterly basis on forms provided for such annual and
quarterly reporting pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, from and after the Issue Date, the
Company will furnish to the Trustee:

(1) within 100 days (120 days in the case of the fiscal year containing the Issue Date) after the end of each
fiscal year, all financial information that would be required to be contained in an annual report on Form
10-K, or any successor or comparable form, filed with the SEC, including a “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and a report on the annual financial
statements by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm;

(2) within 55 days (60 days in the case of the first three fiscal quarters after the Issue Date) after the end of
each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year, all financial information that would be required
to be contained in a quarterly report on Form 10-Q, or any successor or comparable form, filed with the
SEC, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations,” and (B) financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP; and

(3) within 15 days after the occurrence of any of the following events, all current reports that would be
required to be filed with the SEC on Form 8-K or any successor or comparable form (if the Company
had been a reporting company under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act); provided, that the foregoing
shall not obligate the Company to make available (i) any information otherwise required to be included
on a Form 8-K regarding the occurrence of any such events if the Company determines in its good faith
judgment that such event that would otherwise be required to be disclosed is not material to the Holders
of the Notes or the business, assets, operations, financial positions or prospects of the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (ii) a summary of the terms of, any employment or
compensatory arrangement, agreement, plan or understanding between the Company (or any of its
Subsidiaries) and any director, manager or executive officer of the Company (or any of its
Subsidiaries) or (iii) copies of any agreements, financial statements or other items that would be
required to be filed as exhibits to a current report on Form 8-K (except for (x) material Indebtedness
and (y) historical and pro forma financial statements to the extent reasonably available):

(a) the entry into or termination of material agreements;

(b) significant acquisitions or dispositions;

(c) bankruptcy;

(d) cross-default under direct material financial obligations;

(e) a change in the Company’s certifying independent auditor;

(f) the appointment or departure of directors or executive officers;

(g) non-reliance on previously issued financial statements; and

(h) change of control transactions,

in each case, in a manner that complies in all material respects with the requirements specified in such form,
except as described above or below and subject to exceptions consistent with the presentation of information in
the offering circular; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to (i) comply with Regulation G
under the Exchange Act or Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K with respect to any “non-GAAP” financial information

89


-----

contained therein, (ii) provide any information that is not otherwise similar to information currently included in
the offering circular or (iii) provide separate financial statements or other information contemplated by Rule 309, Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X, or in each case any successor provisions or any schedules required
by Regulation S-X. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will not be required to (i) comply
with Sections 302, 906 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or (ii) otherwise furnish any
information, certificates or reports required by Items 307 or 308 of Regulation S-K. To the extent any such
information is not so filed or furnished, as applicable, within the time periods specified above and such
information is subsequently filed or furnished, as applicable, the Company will be deemed to have satisfied its
obligations with respect thereto at such time and any Default with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been
cured; provided that such cure shall not otherwise affect the rights of the Holders under “—Events of Default” if
Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the then total outstanding Notes have declared the principal,
premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and
payable immediately and such declaration shall not have been rescinded or cancelled prior to such cure. In
addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Company will agree that, for so long as any Notes are
outstanding, it will furnish to Holders and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the
information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

Substantially concurrently with the furnishing or making such information available to the Trustee pursuant
to the immediately preceding paragraph, the Company shall also use its commercially reasonable efforts to post
copies of such information required by the immediately preceding paragraph on a website (which may be
nonpublic and may be maintained by the Company or a third party) to which access will be given to Holders,
prospective investors in the Notes (which prospective investors shall be limited to “qualified institutional buyers”
within the meaning of Rule 144A of the Securities Act or non-U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S under the
Securities Act) that certify their status as such to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company), and securities
analysts and market making financial institutions that are, in the case of securities analysts and market making
financial institutions, reasonably satisfactory to the Company. To the extent the Company determines in good
faith that it cannot make such reports available in the manner described in the preceding sentence after the use of
its commercially reasonable efforts, the Company shall furnish such reports to the Holders of the Notes, upon
their request. The Company may condition the delivery of any such reports to such Holders, prospective
investors in the Notes, and securities analysts and market making financial institutions on the agreement of such
Persons to (i) treat all such reports (and the information contained therein) and information as confidential,
(ii) not use such reports and the information contained therein for any purpose other than their investment or
potential investment in the Notes and (iii) not publicly disclose any such reports (and the information contained
therein) and information.

The Company will also hold quarterly conference calls for the Holders of Notes, prospective investors in the
Notes and securities analysts and market making financial institutions, to discuss financial information for the
previous quarter (it being understood that such quarterly conference call may be the same conference call as with
the Company’s (or as applicable, any of any Parent Entity’s) equity investors and analysts). The conference call
will be following the last day of each fiscal quarter of the Company and not later than 10 Business Days from the
time that the Company distributes the financial information as set forth in the third preceding paragraph. No
fewer than two days prior to the conference call, the Company will issue a press release or otherwise announce
the time and date of such conference call and providing instructions for Holders, securities analysts, prospective
investors and market making financial institutions to obtain access to such call.

If the Company has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries and such Unrestricted
Subsidiaries hold in the aggregate more than 5.0% of the Total Assets of the Company, then the annual and
quarterly financial information required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant will include
a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, and in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of the financial
condition and results of operations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial
condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Company.

90


-----

The Indenture will permit the Company to satisfy its obligations in this covenant with respect to financial
information relating to the Company by furnishing financial information relating to a Parent Entity; provided that
the same is accompanied by consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between
the information relating to such Parent Entity (and other direct or indirect Parent Entities included in such
information, if any), on the one hand, and the information relating to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
on a standalone basis, on the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, the consolidating information referred to in
the proviso in the preceding sentence need not be audited.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, if the Company or any Parent Entity of the
Company has furnished the Holders of Notes or filed with the SEC the reports described in the preceding
paragraphs with respect to the Company or any Parent Entity, the Company shall be deemed to be in compliance
with the provisions of this covenant.

**Limitation on Guarantees**

The Company will not permit any of its Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiaries that are Restricted
Subsidiaries (and non-Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiaries if such non-Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiaries
guarantee, or are a co-issuer of, other capital markets debt securities of the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary or guarantee all or a portion of, or are a co-borrower under, the Credit Agreement), other than a
Guarantor, to Guarantee the payment of any Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor, unless:

(1) such Restricted Subsidiary within 60 days (i) executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to the
Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary, except that with respect to a
guarantee of Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor, if such Indebtedness is by its express
terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee, any such
guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in
right of payment to such Guarantee substantially to the same extent as such Indebtedness is
subordinated to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Guarantee of the Notes and (ii) executes and delivers a
supplement or joinder to the Collateral Documents or new Collateral Documents and takes all actions
required thereunder to perfect the Liens created thereunder; provided that if such Indebtedness is by its
express terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee, any
such Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated
in right of payment to such Note Guarantee with respect to the Notes substantially to the same extent as
such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Guarantee of the Notes; and

(2) such Restricted Subsidiary waives and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or
advantage of, any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any other rights against the
Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary as a result of any payment by such Restricted Subsidiary
under its Guarantee until payment in full of Obligations under the Indenture.

_provided that this covenant shall not be applicable (i) to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed_
at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in
contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) in the event that the Guarantee of the
Company’s obligations under the Notes or the Indenture by such Subsidiary would not be permitted under
applicable law.

The Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause any Subsidiary that is not otherwise required to be a
Guarantor to become a Guarantor, in which case, such Subsidiary shall not be required to comply with the 60-day
period described above.

If any Guarantor becomes an Immaterial Subsidiary, the Company shall have the right, by execution and
delivery of a supplemental indenture to the Trustee, to cause such Immaterial Subsidiary to cease to be a
Guarantor, subject to the requirement described in the first paragraph above that such Subsidiary shall be
required to become a Guarantor if it ceases to be an Immaterial Subsidiary (except that if such Subsidiary has

91


-----

been properly designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary it shall not be so required to become a Guarantor or
execute a supplemental indenture); provided, further, that such Immaterial Subsidiary shall not be permitted to
Guarantee the Credit Agreement or other Indebtedness of the Company or the other Guarantors, unless it again
becomes a Guarantor.

**Merger, Amalgamation and Consolidation**

**_The Company_**

The Company will not consolidate with or merge or amalgamate with or into or convey, transfer or lease all
or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) will be a Person organized and
existing under the laws of the United States of America, any State of the United States or the District of
Columbia and the Successor Company (if not the Company) will expressly assume, by supplemental
indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, all the obligations of Company under the Notes, the
Collateral Documents and the Indenture and if such Successor Company is not a corporation, a coobligor of the Notes is a corporation organized or existing under such laws;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the applicable Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the applicable Successor
Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the applicable Successor Company
or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the applicable Successor Company would
be able to Incur at least an additional $1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of
the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries would not be lower than it was immediately prior to
giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel,
each stating that such consolidation, merger, amalgamation or transfer and such supplemental indenture
(if any) comply with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel stating that such supplemental indenture
(if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement
enforceable against the Successor Company, provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel
may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to satisfaction of clauses
(2) and (3) above.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of,
the Company under the Notes, the Collateral Documents and the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2), (3) and (4) (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this
sentence), (a) any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge or
amalgamate into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Company, (b) any Restricted Subsidiary
may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge or amalgamate into or transfer all or part of its properties and
assets to any other Restricted Subsidiary and (c) the Company and its Restricted Subsidiary may complete any
Permitted Tax Restructuring. Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) (which do not apply to the
transactions referred to in this sentence), the Company may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge or
amalgamate into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the
Company, reincorporating the Company in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Company.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

92


-----

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of this section) shall not apply to the
creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company.

**_Guarantors_**

No Guarantor may

(1) consolidate with or merge or amalgamate with or into any Person, or

(2) sell, convey, transfer or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or a series of
related transactions, to any Person, or

(3) permit any Person to merge or amalgamate with or into such Guarantor, unless

(A) the other Person is the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a
Guarantor concurrently with the transaction; or

(B) (1) either (x) the Company or a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving
or transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Note
Guarantee, the Collateral Documents and the Indenture; and

(2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default has occurred and is continuing;
or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, merger
or amalgamation) of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of
the Guarantor (in each case other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise
permitted by the Indenture.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under the
Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Company or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days after written notice by the Trustee on
behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes with any
agreement or obligation contained in the Indenture or the Collateral Documents; provided that in the
case of a failure to comply with the Indenture provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—
Reports,” such period of continuance of such default or breach shall be 270 days after written notice
described in this clause (3) has been given;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any
Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary) (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Company or any Significant
Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary)) other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary
whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date hereof, which default:

93


-----

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after
giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (“payment default”);
or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the “cross
_acceleration provision”);_

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of
any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default of principal at its stated
final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, aggregates to $100.0 million or more at any one time outstanding;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary
or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial
statements for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary
(the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), to pay final judgments aggregating in excess
of $100.0 million other than any judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies
issued by, reputable and creditworthy companies, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged
and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event
such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any
creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed (the “judgment default
_provision”);_

(7) any Guarantee of the Notes by a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect, other than
(1) in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, (2) a Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary
denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Guarantee of the Notes, other than in accordance with the
terms thereof or upon release of such Note Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture or (3) in
connection with the bankruptcy of a Guarantor, so long as the aggregate assets of such Guarantor and
any other Guarantor whose Note Guarantee ceased or ceases to be in full force as a result of a
bankruptcy are less than $100.0 million; or

(8) with respect to any Collateral, individually or in the aggregate, having a fair market value in excess of
$20.0 million, any of the Collateral Documents ceases to be in full force and effect, or any of the
Collateral Documents ceases to give the Holders of the Notes the Liens purported to be created thereby
with the priority contemplated thereby, or any of the Collateral Documents is declared null and void or
the Company or any Guarantor denies in writing that it has any further liability under any Collateral
Document or gives written notice to such effect (in each case other than in accordance with the terms
of the Indenture, the ABL-Notes Intercreditor Agreement and the Collateral Documents), except to the
extent that any loss of perfection or priority results from the failure of the Notes Collateral Agent or the
ABL Collateral Agent to maintain possession of certificates actually delivered to it representing
securities pledged under the Collateral Documents, or otherwise results from an action (but not an
omission) constituting gross negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of the Trustee, the Notes
Collateral Agent or the ABL Collateral Agent; provided, that if a failure of the sort described in this
clause (8) is susceptible of cure (including with respect to any loss of Lien priority on material portions
of the Collateral), no Event of Default shall arise under this clause (8) with respect thereto until 30 days
after notice of such failure shall have been given to the Company by the Trustee or the Holders of at
least 30% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes issued under the Indenture.

However, a Default under clause (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the
Trustee or the Holders of 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Company of the Default
and, with respect to clause (6) the Company does not cure such Default within the time specified in clause (6) of
this paragraph after receipt of such notice.

94


-----

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the
Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company or the Holders of at least 30% in
principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Company and the Trustee may, and the
Trustee (subject to certain conditions) at the request of such holders shall, declare the principal of and accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of
acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “Events of Default” has
occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the
event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or
cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default
shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect
thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a
court of competent jurisdiction.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Company occurs and is continuing,
the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and
payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all
past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal or interest which
may only be waived with the consent of each affected Holder) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to
such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of
competent jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is
cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another
default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and
(ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant
entitled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other
provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such
covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period
specified in the Indenture.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the
request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security
satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of
principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes
unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the
Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security or indemnity
satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request
and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60day period.

95


-----

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are
given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee or the Note Collateral Agent or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee or the Note
Collateral Agent. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent
person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that
conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other
Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the
Trustee and the Note Collateral Agent will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it against all fees, losses,
liabilities and expenses that may be caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such
occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being
notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of or interest on any Note,
the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is
in the interests of the Holders. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of
each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred
during the previous year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence
thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and
what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified
with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes) and,
subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the
consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such Notes). However, an
amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any such Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note (other than
provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note (other than provisions relating to
Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which any
such Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any such Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Note;

(6) impair the contractual right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on such
Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such
payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the amendment,
supplement or modification in accordance with the terms of the Indenture of the covenants described
above under the captions “—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants” and clauses (3), (4),
(6) and (7) of “—Events of Default” and the related definitions shall be deemed not to impair the
contractual right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on such Holder’s Notes
on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or with
respect to such Holder’s Note);

(7) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or interest
(except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in

96


-----

aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such
acceleration);

(8) make any change in the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreements or the Indenture dealing with the
application of proceeds of Collateral that would adversely affect the Holders of the Notes in any
material respect;

(9) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent described
in this sentence; or

(10) except as expressly permitted by the Indenture, modify the Note Guarantees of any Significant
Subsidiary in any manner materially adverse to the Holders.

Without the consent of Holders of at least two-thirds in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding, no amendment or waiver may release all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Lien of the
Indenture and the Collateral Documents with respect to the Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Company, the Trustee and the other
parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Documents and the Company may direct the
Trustee or Note Collateral Agent, the Trustee or Note Collateral Agent shall, enter into an amendment to the
Note Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency, conform any provision to this
“Description of the Notes,” or reduce the minimum denomination of the Notes;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Company or a Guarantor
under any Note Document;

(3) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;

(4) add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any
right or power conferred upon the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect;

Additional Notes;

(8) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance with the Covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness,” to add Guarantees with respect
to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release,

as permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation, to facilitate the issuance and
administration of Notes; provided, however, that (i) compliance with the Indenture as so amended
would not result in Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable
securities law and (ii) such amendment does not adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes

proposed amendment of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the
proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given
in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

**Defeasance**

The Company at any time may terminate all obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under the Note
Documents (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain
obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and
indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Company in connection therewith and obligations
concerning issuing temporary Notes, registrations of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the
maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust.

The Company at any time may terminate the obligations of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries
under the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) of “—Certain
Covenants—Merger, Amalgamation and Consolidation”) and “—Change of Control” and the default provisions
relating to such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a
payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Company and
Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision and the guarantee provision described under “—Events
of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Company at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the
Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes so long as no Notes are
then outstanding. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of
the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3), (4), (5) (with respect
only to Significant Subsidiaries), (6) or (7) under “—Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Company must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
“defeasance trust”) with the Trustee cash in U.S. dollars or U.S. Government Obligations or a combination
thereof for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the
case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, stating
that Holders of the Notes, in their capacity as Holders of the Notes, will not recognize income, gain or
loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject
to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal
defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling of the U.S.

98


-----

Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law since the issuance of the
Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Company; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of transfer or
exchange of the Notes and indemnification rights of the Trustee, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to
all Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen
or destroyed Notes and certain Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the
funds have been released to the Company) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Notes
not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due
and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under
arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at
the expense, of the Company; (2) the Company has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee, money
in U.S. dollars or U.S. Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient
to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation,
for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and
payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Company has paid or caused to
be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; and (4) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent under the
“—Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture
have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of
fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Company or any of its respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Note
Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each
Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S.
federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and the Note Collateral Agent**

Wilmington Trust, National Association will be appointed as Trustee and Notes Collateral Agent under the
Indenture. The Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will
perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in such Indenture. During the existence of an Event of
Default, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same
degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee
to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or
duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the
Company, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of
any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the
Company and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

99


-----

The Indenture sets out the terms under which the Trustee and the Note Collateral Agent may retire or be
removed, and replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee and the Note Collateral Agent
may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of then outstanding Notes, or may
resign at any time by giving written notice to the Company and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or
acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, (b) fails to meet certain minimum limits regarding the
aggregate of its capital and surplus or (c) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or
bankrupt, then the Company may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less
than 6 months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee or the Note Collateral Agent shall not become effective until the
acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee or the successor Note Collateral Agent, as applicable.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes and
expenses incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with
the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

All notices to Holders of Notes will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their
respective addresses in the register of the Holders of the Notes, if any, maintained by the registrar. For so long as
any Notes are represented by global notes, all notices to Holders of the Notes will be delivered to DTC in
accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements
of this paragraph, which will give such notices to the Holders of book-entry interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more
than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed,
such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the earlier of such publication and the fifth day after being so
mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or
other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to him if so mailed within the time prescribed.

Failure to electronically deliver or mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not
affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is electronically delivered or
mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it.

The Indenture and the Notes, including any Note Guarantees and the rights and duties of the parties
thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

facility computed with a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such
Indebtedness during the reference period except as set forth in the first paragraph of this definition. Interest on
Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate,

indirect participants (including Euroclear and Clearstream), which may change from time to time.

**Depository Procedures**

The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream is provided
solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective
settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these operations and
procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

DTC has advised us that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New
York, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal
Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing
agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold
securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and
settlement of transactions in those securities between Participants through electronic book-entry changes in
accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial
purchasers), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s
system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or

141


-----

maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect
Participants”). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC
only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership
interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect
Participants.

DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it:

(1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the initial
purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and

(2) ownership of these interests in Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these
interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or
by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in
Global Notes).

Investors in Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants in DTC’s system may hold their interests therein
directly through DTC. Investors in Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests
therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) that are Participants in DTC. All
interests in a Global Note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Investors in Regulation S
Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants
in those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Distribution
Compliance Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes through
Participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold
interests in Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in
their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as
operator of Euroclear, and Citibank, N.A., as operator of Clearstream which in turn hold such interests in
customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’ names on the books of DTC. Interests in a Global Note held
through Euroclear or Clearstream may be subject to the procedures and requirements of those systems (as well as
to the procedures and requirements of DTC). The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical
delivery in definitive form of securities that they own and the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global
Note to Persons that are subject to those requirements will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on
behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person having
beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge those interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC
system, or otherwise take actions in respect of those interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical
certificate evidencing those interests.

Except as described below, owners of an interest in Global Notes will not have notes registered in their
names, will not receive physical delivery of definitive notes in registered certificated form (“Certificated Notes”)
and will not be considered the registered owners or “Holders” thereof under the Indenture for any purpose.

Payments in respect of the principal of and premium and interest on a Global Note registered in the name of
DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered Holder under the Indenture. Under
the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the Persons in whose names notes, including
Global Notes, are registered as the owners of such notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other
purposes. Consequently, neither the Issuer, the Trustee or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee has or will have
any responsibility or liability for:

(1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or
payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records
relating to the beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes; or

(2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect
Participants.

142


-----

DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the
notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on
the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on that payment date. Each
relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the
principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the
Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary
practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the
responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by
DTC or any of its Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of any notes, and the Issuer and the Trustee
may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all
purposes.

Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between Participants in
DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds and transfers
between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and
operating procedures.

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, cross-market
transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand,
will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case
may be, by its respective depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions
to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules
and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as
the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective
depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant
Global Note from DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day
funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver
instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a Holder of notes only at the
direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and
only in respect of the portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which that Participant or those
Participants has or have given the relevant direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the notes,
DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute
those notes to its Participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing
procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in Global Notes among Participants, they are under no
obligation to perform those procedures, and may discontinue or change those procedures at any time.

Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the
performance by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or their respective Participants or Indirect Participants of their
respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes**

A Global Note is exchangeable for a Certificated Note if:

   - DTC (a) notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the applicable Global Notes
or (b) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in each case, a successor
depositary is not appointed;

   - we at our option, notify, the Trustee in writing that we elect to cause the issuance of Certificated Notes
(although Regulation S Global Notes at the Issuer’s election pursuant to this clause may not be exchanged
for Certificated Notes prior to (a) the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period and (b) the receipt
of any certificates required under the provisions of Regulation S); or

143


-----

   - there has occurred and is continuing a Default or event of default with respect to the notes.

In addition, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Notes upon prior written
notice given to the Issuer and the Registrar by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the Indenture. In all cases,
Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests in a Global Note will be
registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the depositary
(in accordance with its customary procedures) and will bear the applicable restrictive legend referred to in
“Transfer Restrictions,” unless that legend is not required by applicable law.

**Exchange of Certificated Notes for Global Notes**

If Certificated Notes are issued in the future, they will not be exchangeable for beneficial interests in any
Global Note unless the transferor first delivers to the Issuer and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that the transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions
applicable to the notes being transferred. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Exchanges Among Global Notes**

Prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global
Note may be exchanged for beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note only if:

   - the exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the notes pursuant to Rule 144A; and

   - the transferor first delivers to the Issuer and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that the notes are being transferred:

    - to a Person who (i) the transferor reasonably believes to be a qualified institutional buyer within the
meaning of Rule 144A and (ii) is purchasing for its own account or the account of a qualified
institutional buyer in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A; and

    - in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other
jurisdictions.

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the
form of an interest in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the Distribution
Compliance Period, only if the transferor first delivers to the Issuer and the Registrar a written certificate (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that the transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903 or Rule
904 of Regulation S or Rule 144.

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between a Regulation S Global Note and a Rule 144A
Global Note will be effected in DTC by means of an instruction originated by the DTC Participant through the
DTC Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate
adjustments will be made to reflect the changes in the principal amounts of the Regulation S Global Note and the
Rule 144A Global Note, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a
Person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an
interest in the original Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interest in the other
Global Note.

**Same Day Settlement and Payment**

We will make payments in respect of notes represented by Global Notes, including payments of principal,
premium, if any, and interest by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the
DTC or its nominee. We will make all payments of principal of and premium, if any, and interest on Certificated
Notes by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holders of the Certificated

144


-----

Notes or, if no account is specified, by mailing a check to each Holder’s registered address. See “Description of
the Notes—Principal, Maturity and Interest.” Notes represented by Global Notes are expected to be eligible to
trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity in
notes represented by Global Notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available
funds. Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant
purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a Participant will be credited, and any such crediting will be
reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day
(which must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of
DTC. DTC has advised us that cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a
Global Note by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a Participant will be received with value on
the settlement date of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of
the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.

**CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the notes by U.S. Holders and non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below). This
summary is general in nature and does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be
relevant to a holder of notes in light of its particular circumstances. In addition, this summary does not describe
any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. jurisdiction and does not consider any
aspects of U.S. federal tax law other than income taxation (such as estate and gift taxation).

This summary is based on the provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”), the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial authority, published administrative positions
of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this
offering circular. Changes in such authorities or new interpretations thereof may have retroactive effect and could
significantly affect the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below. We have not sought any ruling
from the IRS with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and
there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with our statements and conclusions or that a court
would not sustain any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.

This summary deals only with beneficial owners of notes that purchase the notes for cash in this offering at
their “issue price” (generally, the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold for money to
investors, not including bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of
underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and that will hold the notes as “capital assets” within the meaning
of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This summary is general in nature and
does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that might be relevant to particular holders in light of
their personal investment circumstances or status, nor does it address tax considerations applicable to investors
that may be subject to special tax rules, such as:

   - banks and other financial institutions;

   - dealers or traders in securities or currencies;

   - brokers;

   - investors that have elected mark-to-market treatment;

   - retirement plans and other tax-deferred accounts;

   - tax-exempt entities;

   - S corporations, partnerships or other pass through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes or
investors in such entities;

   - insurance companies;

   - real estate investment trusts;

   - regulated investment companies;

   - non-U.S. trusts or estates with U.S. beneficiaries;

   - U.S. persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

   - investors that hold the notes as part of a hedge, straddle, synthetic security or conversion transaction;

   - controlled foreign corporations;

   - passive foreign investment companies;

   - corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;

   - U.S. Holders who hold notes through non-U.S. brokers or other non-U.S. intermediaries;

146


-----

   - former citizens or residents of the United States subject to Section 877 of the Code;

   - entities subject to the anti-inversion rules; and

   - taxpayers subject to the alternative minimum tax.

In the case of a holder of notes that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the
tax treatment of the notes to a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the tax status of the partner
and the activities of the partner and the partnership. If you are a partner in a partnership considering an
investment in the notes, then you should consult your tax advisors.

The following summary is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for careful tax planning
and advice. Investors considering the purchase of notes should consult their tax advisors with respect to the
application of the U.S. federal income tax laws to their particular situations, as well as any tax consequences
arising under any other U.S. federal tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction or
under any applicable tax treaty.

**Effect of Certain Contingencies**

We may be required to pay amounts in addition to the stated principal amount of and stated interest on the
notes (e.g., at a change in control as described in “Description of the Notes—Change of Control”). Although the
issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of payment of such additional
amounts does not result in the notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under applicable
Treasury regulations. This position will be based in part on our determination that, as of the date of the issuance
of the notes, the possibility that such additional amounts will have to be paid, in the aggregate, is a remote or
incidental contingency within the meaning of applicable Treasury regulations.

Our determination that these contingencies are, in the aggregate, remote or incidental is binding on a holder,
unless such holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which it acquires the notes
that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary
position to that described above, then the notes may be treated as contingent payment debt instruments and a
holder subject to U.S. federal income taxation may be required to accrue interest income on the notes at a rate in
excess of the stated interest and any OID (as defined below) based upon a “comparable yield”. The “comparable
yield” is the yield at which we would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no contingent payments, but with
terms and conditions similar to those of the notes. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, redemption,
retirement or other taxable disposition of the notes would be recharacterized as ordinary income. Holders of
notes should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the notes being treated as contingent
payment debt instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes will not be treated as
contingent payment debt instruments.

**U.S. Holders**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations if you are a U.S. Holder. For
purposes of this summary, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a note that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes:

   - an individual who is a citizen or a resident of the United States;

   - a corporation organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

   - an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

   - a trust, if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over its
administration and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions,
or (ii) in the case of a trust that was treated as a domestic trust under the law in effect before 1997, a valid
election is in place under applicable Treasury regulations to treat such trust as a domestic trust.

147


-----

**Stated Interest**

Stated interest on a note will be included in the gross income of a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the
time that such interest is accrued or received, in accordance with the holder’s regular method of accounting for
U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**Original issue discount**

If the stated principal amount of the notes exceeds their issue price (as defined above) by an amount greater
than or equal to a statutorily-defined de minimis threshold (generally, 1/4 of 1 percent of the principal amount of
the notes, multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity from their original issue date), then the notes
will be considered to be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for United States federal income tax
purposes. The amount of OID on a note generally is equal to the excess of the note’s stated principal amount over
its issue price. If the notes are issued with OID, a U.S. Holder of a note (i) generally will be required to include
the OID on a note in gross income (as ordinary interest income) as such OID accrues, on a constant yield basis
over the term of the note, in advance of the receipt of the cash attributable to such OID and regardless of the
holder’s regular method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, but (ii) generally will not
be required to recognize any additional income upon the receipt of any cash payment on the note that is
attributable to previously accrued OID that has been included in such holder’s income.

**Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of a Note**

Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note, a U.S. Holder
generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount realized upon the
disposition and (ii) the holder’s adjusted tax basis in the note. The amount realized will be equal to the sum of the
amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in exchange for the note, less any portion
allocable to any accrued and unpaid stated interest, which portion will be taxed as ordinary interest income (as
described above under “—Stated Interest”) to the extent not previously so taxed. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax
basis in a note generally will equal the cost of the note to such holder, increased by any OID included in income
by such U.S. Holder with respect to such note. Any such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss, and
will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has held the note for more than one year. In general,
long-term capital gains of a non-corporate U.S. Holder are taxed at lower rates than those applicable to ordinary
income. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax
advisors as to the deductibility of capital losses in their particular circumstances.

**Medicare Tax**

A 3.8% tax is imposed on certain U.S. Holders who are individuals, estates or trusts on the lesser of (1) the
U.S. Holder’s “net investment income” (or undistributed “net investment income” in the case of a trust or estate)
for the relevant taxable year and (2) the excess of the U.S. Holder’s modified adjusted gross income for the
taxable year over a certain threshold (which in the case of individuals will be between $125,000 and $250,000,
depending on the individual’s circumstances). A U.S. Holder’s net investment income will generally include its
interest income (including any OID) and its net gains from the disposition of notes, unless such interest income
or net gains are derived in the ordinary course of the conduct of a trade or business (other than a trade or business
that consists of certain passive or trading activities). If you are a U.S. Holder that is an individual, estate or trust,
you are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding the applicability of the Medicare tax to your income and
gains in respect of your investment in the notes.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

In general, we must report certain information to the IRS with respect to payments of stated interest,
accruals of OID, and payments of the proceeds of the sale or other taxable disposition (including a retirement or
redemption) of a note, to certain U.S. Holders. The payor (which may be us or an intermediate payor) may be

148


-----

required to impose backup withholding at a rate of 28%, if (i) the payee fails to furnish a taxpayer identification
number (“TIN”) to the payor or to otherwise establish an exemption from backup withholding; (ii) the IRS
notifies the payor that the TIN furnished by the payee is incorrect; (iii) there has been a notified payee
underreporting described in section 3406(c) of the Code; or (iv) the payee has not certified under penalties of
perjury that it has furnished a correct TIN and that the IRS has not notified the payee that it is subject to backup
withholding under the Code. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the
backup withholding rules from a payment to a U.S. Holder will be allowed as a credit against that holder’s U.S.
federal income tax liability, if any, and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided that the required information
is timely furnished to the IRS.

**Non-U.S. Holders**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations if you are a non-U.S. Holder.
For purposes of this summary, the term “non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a note that is, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes:

   - a nonresident alien individual;

   - a foreign corporation; or

   - a foreign estate or trust.

The following discussion assumes that no item of income, gain, deduction or loss derived by a non-U.S.
Holder in respect of the notes at any time is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business.
Non-U.S. Holders with any item of income, gain, deduction or loss in respect of the notes that is effectively
connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S.
federal income tax and branch profits tax consequences of investing in the notes.

**Payment of Interest**

Subject to the discussions below of backup withholding and FATCA (as defined below), interest (including
any OID) paid on a note by us or any paying agent to a non-U.S. Holder will be exempt from U.S. federal income
and withholding tax, provided that:

   - the non-U.S. Holder does not, actually or constructively, own 10% or more of the combined voting power
of all classes of our voting stock and is not a controlled foreign corporation related to us, actually or
constructively;

   - the non-U.S. Holder is not a bank that acquired the note in consideration for an extension of credit made
pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business; and

   - either (a) the non-U.S. Holder provides to the payor an applicable IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or
a suitable substitute form), signed under penalties of perjury, that includes its name and address and that
certifies its non-U.S. status in compliance with applicable law and regulations, (b) a securities clearing
organization, bank or other financial institution that holds customers’ securities in the ordinary course of
its trade or business on behalf of the non-U.S. Holder provides a statement to the payor under penalties of
perjury in which it certifies that an applicable IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or a suitable substitute
form) has been received by it from the non-U.S. Holder, or (c) the non-U.S. Holder holds its notes
through a “qualified intermediary” and the qualified intermediary provides the payor with a properly
executed IRS Form W-8IMY (or other applicable form) on behalf of itself together with any applicable
underlying IRS forms sufficient to establish that the non-U.S. Holder is not a U.S. Holder. This
certification requirement may be satisfied with other documentary evidence in the case of a note held in
an offshore account or through certain foreign intermediaries.

If a non-U.S. Holder cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest (including any
OID) made to such holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at the rate of 30%, unless the

149


-----

holder provides the payor with a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or suitable substitute
form) establishing an exemption from or reduction in the withholding tax under the benefit of an applicable tax
treaty.

**Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of a Note**

Subject to the discussions below of backup withholding and FATCA, a non-U.S. Holder generally will not
be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax on any gain realized on a sale, exchange, redemption,
retirement or other taxable disposition of a note (other than in respect of any amount representing accrued but
unpaid interest (including any OID) on the note, which is subject to the rules discussed above under “—Payment
of Interest”), unless the non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more
during the taxable year of the disposition of a note and certain other requirements are met, in which case such
non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a flat rate of 30 percent (unless a lower
applicable tax treaty rate applies) on any such holder’s net U.S.-source gain.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

The amount of interest (including any OID) paid to a non-U.S. Holder and the amount of tax, if any,
withheld from such payment generally must be reported annually to the non-U.S. Holder and to the IRS. The IRS
may make this information available under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty to the tax authorities
in the country in which the non-U.S. Holder is resident.

Provided that a non-U.S. Holder has complied with certain reporting procedures (usually satisfied by
providing an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E) or otherwise establishes an exemption, the non-U.S. Holder
generally will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to interest payments on a note. Rules relating to
information reporting requirements and backup withholding with respect to the payment of proceeds from the
disposition (including a redemption or retirement) of a note are as follows:

   - if the proceeds are paid to or through the U.S. office of a broker, a non-U.S. Holder generally will be
subject to backup withholding and information reporting unless the non-U.S. Holder certifies under
penalties of perjury that it is not a U.S. person (usually on an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E) or
otherwise establishes an exemption;

   - if the proceeds are paid to or through a non-U.S. office of a broker that is a U.S. person or that has certain
specified U.S. connections, a non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to information reporting (but
generally not backup withholding) unless the non U.S. Holder certifies under penalties of perjury that it is
not a U.S. person (usually on an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E) or otherwise establishes an
exemption; and

   - if the proceeds are paid to or through a non-U.S. office of a broker that is not a U.S. person and does not
have certain specified U.S. connections, a non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to backup
withholding or information reporting.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
from a payment to a non-U.S. Holder will be allowed as a credit against the non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal
income tax liability, if any, and may entitle the holder to a refund, provided that the required information is
timely furnished to the IRS.

**Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (“FATCA”) generally impose U.S. federal withholding tax of 30%
on interest income (including any OID) paid on a debt obligation and, after December 31, 2018, on the gross
proceeds of a disposition of a debt obligation paid to (i) a foreign financial institution (whether such foreign
financial institution is the beneficial owner or an intermediary), unless such institution enters into an agreement

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

**General**

The U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), imposes certain
requirements on employee benefit plans subject to Title I of ERISA and on entities that are deemed to hold the
assets of such plans (“ERISA Plans”), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans.
Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including, but not limited
to, the requirement of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plan’s
investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the plan.

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an
ERISA Plan (as well as those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the
Code, such as individual retirement accounts or an entity deemed to hold the assets of such plans (together with
ERISA Plans, “Plans”)) and certain persons (referred to as “parties in interest” or “disqualified persons”) having
certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction.
A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to
excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the plan
that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA
and the Code.

Any Plan fiduciary which proposes to cause a Plan to purchase the notes should consult with its counsel
regarding the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code to such an investment, and to confirm that such purchase and holding is in accordance
with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and will not constitute or result in a non-exempt
prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA.

Non-U.S. plans, governmental plans and certain U.S. church plans, while not subject to the fiduciary
responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the
Code, may nevertheless be subject to non-US, state, local or other federal laws or regulations that are
substantially similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA or the Code (“Similar Law”). Fiduciaries of any such
plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing the notes to determine the suitability of the notes for
such plan and the need for, and the availability, if necessary, of any exemptive relief under any such law or
regulations.

**Prohibited Transaction Exemptions**

The fiduciary of a Plan that proposes to purchase and hold any notes should consider, among other things,
whether such purchase and holding may involve a prohibited transaction, including without limitation (i) the
direct or indirect extension of credit between a Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, (ii) the sale or
exchange of any property between a Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, or (iii) the transfer to, or
use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or disqualified person, of any Plan assets.

Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules could be applicable to the purchase and holding of
notes by a Plan, depending on the type and circumstances of the fiduciary making the decision to acquire such
notes and the relationship of the party in interest or disqualified person to the Plan. Included among these
exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code for certain transactions
between a Plan and non-fiduciary service providers to the Plan. In addition, the U.S. Department of Labor has
issued certain administrative prohibited transaction exemptions that may apply to the purchase and holding of
notes, including Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (“PTCE”) 84-14 (relating to transactions effected by a
“qualified professional asset manager”), PTCE 90-1 (relating to investments by insurance company pooled
separate accounts), PTCE 91-38 (relating to investments by bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60
(relating to investments by insurance company general accounts) or PTCE 96-23 (relating to transactions directed
by an in-house asset manager) (collectively, the “Class Exemptions”)

152


-----

Each of these exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application, and there can be no
assurance that any of these Class Exemptions or any other exemption will be available with respect to any
particular transaction involving the notes.

**Consultation with Counsel**

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be comprehensive; by its offer of the
notes, the Issuer makes no representation that the purchase or holding of such notes meets the relevant legal
requirements with respect to any particular investor. The complexity of these rules, and the severity of potential
penalties, make it particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering an acquisition of notes on
behalf of or with the plan assets of any Plan, or plan subject to Similar Law, consult with its counsel regarding
the suitability of an acquisition of the notes in light of such prospective purchaser’s particular circumstances.

**Deemed Representation**

By its acquisition of any note or any interest therein, the purchaser or transferee thereof will be deemed to
have represented and warranted that either:

   - (i) no portion of the assets used by the purchaser or transferee to acquire or hold the notes or an interest
therein constitutes the assets of any Plan or non-U.S., governmental or church plan that is subject to
Similar Law or (ii) the acquisition, holding and dispositions of such notes or an interest therein by such
purchaser or transferee does not and will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction
under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or violation under any applicable Similar Law.

153


-----

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any other applicable securities
law and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons
(as such terms are defined under the Securities Act) except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and such other securities laws. Accordingly, the
notes are being offered hereby only (a) to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers (as
defined in Rule 144A) in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act
provided by Rule 144A and (b) outside the United States to persons other than U.S. persons in reliance upon
Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Each purchaser of the notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented
to, and agreed with us and the initial purchasers as follows:

(1) It understands and acknowledges that the notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any
other applicable securities law, the notes are being offered for resale in transactions not requiring
registration under the Securities Act or any other securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule
144A, and none of the notes may be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with
the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities law, pursuant to an
exemption therefrom or in a transaction not subject thereto and in each case in compliance with the
conditions for transfer set forth in paragraph (4) below.

(2) It is either:

(A) a qualified institutional buyer and is aware that any sale of the notes to it will be made in reliance
on Rule 144A. Such acquisition will be for its own account or for the account of another qualified
institutional buyer, or

(B) an institution that, at the time the buy order for the notes was originated, was outside the United
States and was not a U.S. person (and was not purchasing for the account or benefit of a U.S.
person) within the meaning of Regulation S (an “Initial Foreign Purchaser”).

(3) It acknowledges that none of the Issuer, the guarantors or the initial purchasers or any person
representing the Issuer or the guarantors or the initial purchasers has made any representation to it with
respect to the Issuer, the guarantors or the offering or sale of any notes, other than the information
included in this offering circular, which offering circular has been delivered to it. Accordingly, it
acknowledges that no representation or warranty is made by the initial purchasers as to the accuracy or
completeness of such materials. It has had access to such financial and other information as it has
deemed necessary in connection with its decision to purchase any of the notes, including an
opportunity to ask questions of and request information from the Issuer, the guarantors and the initial
purchasers, and it has received and reviewed all information that it requested.

(4) It is purchasing the notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which it is acting
as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act, subject to any requirement
of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all
times within its or their control and subject to its or their ability to resell such notes pursuant to Rule
144A, Regulation S or any exemption from registration available under the Securities Act. It agrees on
its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing the notes and each
subsequent holder of the notes by its acceptance thereof will agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer
such notes prior to the date which is one year after the later of the date of the original issue of the notes,
the original issue date of any additional notes and the last date on which we or any of our affiliates was
the owner of such notes (the “Resale Restriction Termination Date”) only (a) to us or any of our
subsidiaries, (b) pursuant to a registration statement which has been declared effective under the
Securities Act, (c) for so long as the notes are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person it

154


-----

reasonably believes is a qualified institutional buyer that purchases for its own account or for the
account of a qualified institutional buyer to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in
reliance on Rule 144A, (d) pursuant to offers and sales to non-U.S. persons that occur outside the
United States within the meaning of Regulation S under the Securities Act, (e) pursuant to an
exemption from registration provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act (if available) or (f) pursuant
to any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, subject in
each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property
of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and to compliance with
any applicable state securities laws. The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to
the Resale Restriction Termination Date. Each purchaser acknowledges that we and the Registrar
reserve the right prior to any offer, sale or other transfer pursuant to clause (d) prior to the end of the
40-day distribution compliance period within the meaning of Regulation S under the Securities Act or
pursuant to clauses (e) or (f) prior to the Resale Restriction Termination Date of the notes to require the
delivery of an opinion of counsel, certifications and/or other information satisfactory to us.

Each certificate representing a note will include a legend substantially to the following effect:

THE NOTES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS. NEITHER THIS NOTE

(8) It acknowledges that we, the initial purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the
foregoing acknowledgments, representations, warranties and agreements and agrees that if any of the

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC is acting as representative of the initial purchasers named below.
Subject to the terms and conditions stated in the purchase agreement dated the date of this offering circular, each
initial purchaser named below has severally agreed to purchase, and we have agreed to sell to that initial
purchaser, the principal amount of notes set forth opposite the initial purchaser’s name.


**Initial Purchaser**

The purchase agreement provides that the obligations of the initial purchasers to purchase the notes are
subject to approval of legal matters by counsel and to other conditions. The initial purchasers must purchase all
the notes if they purchase any of the notes.

The initial purchasers propose to resell the notes at the offering price set forth on the cover page of this
offering circular within the United States to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers (as
defined in Rule 144A) in reliance on Rule 144A and outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S. See
“Transfer Restrictions.” The price at which the notes are offered may be changed at any time without notice. The
initial purchasers may offer and sell notes through certain of their affiliates.

The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and
may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as
defined in Regulation S) except in transactions exempt from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of
the Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within the
United States by a dealer that is not participating in this offering may violate the registration requirements of the
Securities Act if that offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A.

We have agreed that, during the period from the date of this offering circular through and including the date
that is 180 days after the date of this offering circular, we and the guarantors will not, without the prior written
consent of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt
securities issued or guaranteed by us or any of the guarantors having a tenor of more than one year.

The notes will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to
list the notes on any securities exchange or automated inter-dealer quotation system. We cannot assure you that
the prices at which the notes will sell in the market after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering
prices or that an active trading market for the notes will develop and continue after this offering. The initial
purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the notes. However, they are not
obligated to do so and they may discontinue any market-making activities with respect to the notes at any time
without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of, or the trading market for, the notes.

In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell notes in the open market.
Purchases and sales in the open market may include short sales, purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing
purchases.

   - Short sales involve secondary market sales by the initial purchasers of a greater number of notes than they
are required to purchase in the offering.

157


-----

   - Covering transactions involve purchases of notes in the open market after the distribution has been
completed in order to cover short positions.

   - Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase notes so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a
specified maximum.

Purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases, as well as other purchases by the initial purchasers
for their own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes. They
may also cause the price of the notes to be higher than the price that would otherwise exist in the open market in the
absence of these transactions. The initial purchasers may conduct these transactions in the over-the-counter market or
otherwise. If the initial purchasers commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.

The initial purchasers are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include
securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal
investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates have in the
past performed commercial banking, investment banking and advisory services for us from time to time for which they
have received customary fees and reimbursement of expenses and may, from time to time, engage in transactions with
and perform services for us in the ordinary course of their business for which they may receive customary fees and
reimbursement of expenses. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and their
respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or
related derivative securities) and financial instruments (which may include bank loans and/or credit default swaps) for
their own account and for the accounts of their customers and may at any time hold long and short positions in such
securities and instruments. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours
or our affiliates. Certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates that have a lending relationship with us
routinely hedge, and certain other of the initial purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us
may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. A typical such
hedging strategy would include these initial purchasers or their affiliates hedging such exposure by entering into
transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our
securities. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or
publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or
recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

An affiliate of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. acts as administrative agent and collateral agent in
connection with the ABL Facility, an affiliate of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. acts as administrative agent and
collateral agent in connection with the First-Lien Facility and certain of the initial purchasers act or may act as
lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

Certain of the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates may hold a portion of the Existing Secured Notes and, as
such, may receive a portion of the net proceeds in connection with this offering. Additionally, certain of the initial
purchasers and/or their affiliates may be lenders under the First Lien Facility and, as such, may receive a portion of
the net proceeds in connection with the repayment of existing indebtedness under the First Lien Facility.

We have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the
Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to make because of any of
those liabilities.

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on, 2016, which will
be the tenth business day following the date of pricing of the notes (such settlement being referred to as “T+ ”).
Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in three
business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish
to trade notes on the date hereof or on the next succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the
fact that the notes initially settle in T+, to specify an alternative settlement arrangement at the time of any such
trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes which wish to trade the notes during such period
should consult their advisors.

initial purchasers.

The distribution of notes in Canada is being made only in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and
British Columbia on a private placement basis exempt from the requirement that we prepare and file a prospectus
with the securities regulatory authorities in each province where trades of these securities are made. Any resale of
the notes in Canada must be made under applicable securities laws which may vary depending on the relevant

159


-----

jurisdiction, and which may require resales to be made under available statutory exemptions or under a
discretionary exemption granted by the applicable Canadian securities regulatory authority. Purchasers are
advised to seek legal advice prior to any resale of the securities.

**Representations of Canadian Purchasers**

By purchasing notes in Canada and accepting delivery of a purchase confirmation, a purchaser is
representing to us and the dealer from whom the purchase confirmation is received that:

   - the purchaser is entitled under applicable provincial securities laws to purchase the notes without the
benefit of a prospectus qualified under those securities laws as it is an “accredited investor” as defined
under National Instrument 45-106—Prospectus Exemptions,

   - the purchaser is a “permitted client” as defined in National Instrument 31-103—Registration

Canadian purchasers are hereby notified that Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities
Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. are

_Underwriting Conflicts from having to provide certain conflict of interest disclosure in this document._

**Statutory Rights of Action**

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies for
rescission or damages if the offering circular (including any amendment thereto) such as this document contains
a misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within
the time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser of
these securities in Canada should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s
province or territory for particulars of these rights or consult with a legal advisor.

**Enforcement of Legal Rights**

All of our directors and officers as well as the experts named herein may be located outside of Canada and,
as a result, it may not be possible for Canadian purchasers to effect service of process within Canada upon us or
those persons. All or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of those persons may be located outside of
Canada and, as a result, it may not be possible to satisfy a judgment against us or those persons in Canada or to
enforce a judgment obtained in Canadian courts against us or those persons outside of Canada.

**Taxation and Eligibility for Investment**

Canadian purchasers of notes should consult their own legal and tax advisors with respect to the tax
consequences of an investment in the notes in their particular circumstances and about the eligibility of the notes
for investment by the purchaser under relevant Canadian legislation.
