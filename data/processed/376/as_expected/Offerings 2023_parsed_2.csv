The Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering circular were audited by Grant Thornton LLP, independent auditors, as set forth in their independent auditor’s report included elsewhere in this offering circular. The interim financial information of the Company presented in this offering circular has been derived from the Company’s unaudited financial statements for the six-month periods ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022 included elsewhere in this offering circular. Our financial results for the six months ended December 31, 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, and you should not assume the financial results for any past periods indicate results for any future period. In addition, we have presented in this offering circular certain summary financial information for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, which we calculated by taking the results of operations of the Company for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 and adding to it the results of operations of the Company for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and deducting from it the results of operations of the Company for the six months ended December 31, 2021. The financial information for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 does not comply with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, and should not be used as the basis for or prediction of an annualized calculation. This data has been prepared solely for the purpose of this offering circular and is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting and has not been audited or reviewed. In the context of any discussion of the Company’s historical financial information in this offering circular, any reference to a year relates to the Company’s fiscal year ended on June 30 of that year.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

Key position data used throughout this offering circular reflects our best estimates relating to our specific product lines within our divisions and is on the basis of Net Sales for the periods indicated. We also obtained market, industry and other data from third parties. Although we believe that the good faith estimates and determinations of management are reliable, neither we nor the initial purchasers can guarantee the accuracy or completeness of this information, and the initial purchasers have not independently verified this information. In addition, although industry publications, studies and surveys generally state that information therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, they do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information.

376_2,Offerings 2023.md,2946,"NON-GAAP, COMBINED AND AS ADJUSTED FINANCIAL MEASURES AND INFORMATION",2946.1,,2946.1.1,,"EBITDA, Management Adjusted EBITDA, Combined Net Sales, Combined Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and Combined Free Cash Flow, as well as any ratios related thereto (collectively, the “nonGAAP measures”) are presented in this offering circular as supplemental measures of our performance. These non-GAAP measures are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP or SEC rules regarding the presentation of non-GAAP and pro forma financial information. These are not measures of our financial performance under GAAP. The non-GAAP measures presented herein have been prepared by us and were not reviewed or audited by our auditors. The SEC has adopted rules to regulate the use in filings with the SEC and in public disclosures of nonGAAP financial measures that are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. These rules govern the manner in which non-GAAP financial measures are publicly presented and require, among other things, a presentation with equal or greater prominence of the most comparable financial measure or measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, as well as a statement disclosing the purposes for which the registrant’s management uses the non-GAAP financial measure. These rules also prohibit, among other things, exclusions of charges or liabilities that require cash settlement or would have required cash settlement absent an ability to settle in another manner from non-GAAP liquidity measures and adjustment of a non-GAAP performance measure to eliminate or smooth items identified as non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, when the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably likely to occur. The non-GAAP measures presented in this offering circular do not comply with the SEC rules governing the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures that are applicable to SEC registrants and filings with the SEC. Our management uses these non-GAAP measures for planning and forecasting future periods. In particular, EBITDA and Management Adjusted EBITDA are presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that EBITDA and Management Adjusted EBITDA are widely ----- used to measure performance, and as a basis for valuation, and is therefore useful in measuring performance at a consolidated or segment level as well. EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Management Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA to eliminate the impact of certain non-cash items, closures, exit and carrying costs, other non-recurring costs, merger and acquisition costs, foreign exchange (gains) and losses and certain other defined addbacks. In addition, because we have historically reported EBITDA and Management Adjusted EBITDA, we believe their inclusion provides consistency in our financial reporting. However, the presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, cash flows from operating activities and other statement of operations or cash flows data prepared in accordance with GAAP as a measure of liquidity or profitability. Because of these limitations, you should rely primarily on our GAAP results and use the non-GAAP measures only supplementally. For more information and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most closely comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, see “Summary — Summary Financial Information — Summary Non-GAAP Financial Information and Combined Data”. We have also presented Combined Net Sales, Combined Adjusted EBITDA and Combined Free Cash Flow to further present the impact of certain acquisitions. Combined Net Sales represents Net Sales adjusted to give effect to the Acquisition Transactions for the periods presented. Combined Adjusted EBITDA represents Management Adjusted EBITDA adjusted to give effect to the Acquisition Transactions and the unrealized synergies of each of the Acquisition Transactions for the periods presented. Combined Free Cash Flow represents Combined Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures. Management believes Combined Net Sales, Combined Adjusted EBITDA and Combined Free Cash Flow represent useful metrics for investors to assess the operating performance and liquidity trends of the Company in light of the Acquisition Transactions. The presentation of Combined Net Sales, Combined Adjusted EBITDA and Combined Free Cash Flow have been prepared solely in connection with the Acquisition Transactions for the purpose of this offering circular and are not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting practices. For more information and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most closely comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, see “Summary — Summary Financial Information — Summary Non-GAAP Financial Information and Combined Data”. The adjustments made in calculating the non-GAAP measures included herein are based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to be inaccurate. The presentation of the non-GAAP measures included herein should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by non-recurring items, that the acquired businesses would have had the same results if they had been owned by us for the entire period, that we will be able to make similar acquisitions in the future. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related To The Notes and This Offering — The unaudited as adjusted and other non-GAAP financial information presented in this offering circular is based on management estimates and assumptions that may prove to be incorrect”. We also present certain financial information as of December 31, 2022 on an as adjusted basis to give further effect to the Refinancing (as defined herein), assuming issuance of the notes offered hereby at par and placing excess proceeds from the Refinancing on our balance sheet as described in “Use of Proceeds”. See “Capitalization”. In addition, our calculation and presentation of non-GAAP measures in this offering circular differs from the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA and related financial measures contained in the section entitled “Description of Notes” of this offering circular and the related indenture. Accordingly, the nonGAAP measures in this offering circular do not provide precise indications as to the level of our adherence to the financial covenants of the indenture relating to the notes offered hereby, the 2024 Notes Indenture, the 2025 Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or the New Term Loan Facility. This unaudited as adjusted or combined information is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what our actual results of operations or financial position would have been if the issuance of the notes offered hereby and the application of the proceeds thereof had occurred at the beginning of the period considered (or, for balance sheet information, at the end of such period). The unaudited as adjusted or combined data set forth in this offering circular is based upon available ----- information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable. The unaudited as adjusted or combined financial data has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act relating to the preparation of pro forma information or GAAP. Neither the assumptions underlying the adjustments nor the resulting as adjusted information have been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

Third quarter of fiscal year 2023 Combined Net Sales, Management Adjusted EBITDA and Combined Adjusted EBITDA were impacted by several factors. In both of our divisions, price increases implemented to negate rising input costs were offset by volume declines caused by customer destocking efforts as supply chains stabilize post-COVID. In the Healthcare division, we experienced slight growth over the prior year quarter. In the Consumer Products division, customer destocking efforts impacted results more than the positive impact of price increases. Both of our divisions’ results were negatively impacted by foreign exchange costs. Because we have not yet completed our financial closing procedures and because of the forwardlooking nature of the estimated Management Adjusted EBITDA and Combined Adjusted EBITDA presented above, we do not have specific quantifications of the amounts that would be required to provide a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to Management Adjusted EBITDA and Combined Adjusted EBITDA for the three months, nine months and twelve months ended March 31, 2023. We believe that there is a degree of variability with respect to certain of the GAAP measures and certain adjustments made to arrive at the relevant non-GAAP measure that precludes us from providing an accurate preliminary estimate ----- of a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation without unreasonable effort or expense. As a result, we believe that providing estimates of the amounts that would be required to reconcile the amounts of Management Adjusted EBITDA and Combined Adjusted EBITDA to net income would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors for the reasons identified above. For the definition of Management Adjusted EBITDA and Combined Adjusted EBITDA and related disclosure, including a reconciliation of our historical net income to Management Adjusted EBITDA and Combined Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended June 30, 2022 and the six months ended December 31, 2022, see “— Summary Consolidated Historical Financial Data” in this offering circular.

Not all companies use identical calculations and, therefore, our presentation of Management Adjusted EBITDA and Combined Adjusted EBITDA and the ratios related thereto may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in our industry. Further, as described in more detail in notes to the tables set forth below, our Management Adjusted EBITDA and Combined Adjusted EBITDA are based on a number of assumptions and estimates. Our GAAP results of operations for each of the periods presented are significantly different from our Management Adjusted EBITDA and Combined Adjusted EBITDA for those same periods. EBITDA, Management Adjusted EBITDA and Combined Adjusted EBITDA are only used by us for supplemental purposes and should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business.

376_2,Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related To Our Capital Structure,13.1.1,"Our substantial leverage after giving effect to the Refinancing, could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our divisions, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the notes or the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.","As of December 31, 2022, our total debt (before deducting estimated original issue discount and debt issuance costs) was approximately $2.47 billion. As adjusted to give effect to the Refinancing (before deducting estimated original issue discount and debt issuance costs), our total debt as of December 31, 2022 was approximately $2.51 billion. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our debt, we may need to refinance our debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain necessary funds. We do not know whether we will be able to take any of such actions on a timely basis or on terms satisfactory to us or at all. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including: - making it more difficult for us to make payments on the notes offered hereby or the Senior Secured Credit Facilities; - increasing our vulnerability to general economic and market conditions; - requiring a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, make capital expenditures, execute future strategic business improvements and pursue business opportunities; - exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because our borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are at variable rates of interest; - restricting us from making acquisitions or causing us to make divestitures or similar transactions; - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, refinancing, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes; - limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged or have comparable debt at more favorable interest rates and who, as a result, may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns or to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions; and - increasing our cost of borrowing. Borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness may increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. ----- Assuming all loans are drawn under the New Term Loan Facility, a 0.125% change in the floating rate would result in approximately an additional $1.1 million increase in our annual cash interest expense.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352
376_2,Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related To Our Capital Structure,13.1.2,"Despite our substantial indebtedness, we may still be able to incur significantly more debt. The incurrence of additional debt could increase the risks associated with our substantial leverage, including our ability to service our indebtedness.","We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, including additional tranches of term loans and/or term loan increases, increases in the revolving commitments and/or additional revolving credit facilities. Although the indenture governing the notes offered hereby, the ABL Credit Agreement, and the Amended Term Loan Credit Agreement will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are and will be subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also do not and will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. If we incur additional indebtedness or other obligations, the current risks related to our substantial leverage would increase and could have a negative impact on us or our credit ratings. Each of the ABL Credit Agreement and the Amended Term Loan Credit Agreement provides that we have the right at any time to request, in the case of the ABL Facility, increases in the revolving commitments or, in the case of the Amended Term Loan Facility, additional term loan tranches and/or term loan increases, up to the relevant amounts specified in the ABL Credit Agreement or the Amended Term Loan Credit Agreement, which, in the case of term loans, may be unlimited subject to our compliance with the relevant financial ratio tests, respectively. The lenders under the ABL Facility or the Amended Term Loan Facility are not under any obligation to provide any such incremental commitments or loans, which are uncommitted, and any such addition of or increase in commitments or loans will be subject to obtaining commitments and certain customary conditions precedent to be set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement or the Amended Term Loan Credit Agreement, as applicable. A material portion of our indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). Assuming all loans are drawn under the New Term Loan Facility, a hypothetical 1.0% adverse change in the SOFR rate or EURIBOR rates would have resulted in higher interest expense of approximately $4.4 million for the six month period ended December 31, 2022. Borrowings under our ABL Facility as of December 31, 2022 totaled $18.7 million. Any additional amounts borrowed under the ABL Facility in the future will be subject to changes in SOFR and resultant interest expense.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352
376_2,Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related To Our Capital Structure,13.1.3,"Our ability to generate cash or refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.","Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, seek additional capital, restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, or sell assets. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including the notes, the ABL Facility and/or the Amended Term Loan Facility, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. ----- If for any reason we are unable to meet our debt service obligations, we would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness. If such a default were to occur, subject to the applicable grace periods, the lenders under the ABL Facility or the Amended Term Loan Facility could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility or the Amended Term Loan Facility immediately due and payable, and the lenders would not be obligated to continue to advance funds under the ABL Facility. If the amounts outstanding are accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets will be sufficient to repay in full the money owed to the banks or to our debt holders, including holders of the notes offered hereby.

However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate suitable candidates or acquire them on acceptable terms or, ----- because of limitations imposed by the agreements governing our indebtedness, that we will be able to secure financing for future acquisitions on acceptable terms. Acquisitions involve special risks, including, without limitation, the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies, difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses, disruption of our existing business, dissipation of our limited management resources, and impairment of relationships with employees and customers of the acquired business as a result of changes in ownership and management. While we believe that strategic acquisitions can improve our competitiveness and profitability, these activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The integration of other businesses we have recently acquired, including the Acquisition Transactions, and any business combination transactions we enter into in the future have required and will require significant management time, attention and resources. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated financial and strategic benefits of these integrations and transactions if they are not successful for any reason, take longer than expected to complete or are more costly than expected to complete. Our ability to realize the anticipated financial and strategic benefits of these transactions depends, to a large extent, on our ability to implement operational and other changes in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes anticipated efficiencies. Potential difficulties we may encounter during the course of these integrations that may affect our ability to realize their anticipated financial and strategic benefits include the following: - the cost, complexities and uncertainties associated with integrating acquired businesses and consummating pending and future transactions; - the complexities of integrating companies or assets with their own history, culture, regulatory restrictions, markets and customer bases, and the possibility that assets acquired may be insufficient to operate an acquired business line as planned; - potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, including pending litigation, delays or regulatory conditions associated with such transactions; - the risk that disagreements between the Sponsor and our management could cause significant distraction to our management and other disruptions to our operations or the development or implementation of our business strategies; - the risk that we are unable to renegotiate arrangements with customers, suppliers and other vendors that have historically been operating under contracts with the businesses we have acquired or plan to acquire, on terms acceptable to us, or at all; - the risk that we are unable to continue or begin operations at acquired facilities on the timelines we anticipate, due to permitting issues, required reconfiguration or retrofitting of environmental control or other equipment or other issues, resulting in delays and other disruptions in our operations; - performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by completing such transactions and establishing new business operations, or for other reasons; - the inability to retain key employees of acquired businesses because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire to remain with such acquired businesses; and - the inability to fill key positions of employees of acquired businesses who did not, or will not, transition to our business as part of the relevant acquisition. When we successfully acquire another business, the process of successfully integrating the acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing business. Failure to retain and develop the acquired customer base and workforce, to integrate information technology systems or to establish and maintain appropriate controls, or unknown or contingent liabilities, could adversely affect our ability to realize such anticipated benefits of acquisitions. If we are not able to successfully achieve our objectives for one or more of these reasons, or for other reasons, the anticipated financial and strategic benefits of these transactions may not be fully ----- realized, or it may take longer to realize than expected. In addition, you should be aware that any or all of these integrations and transactions could result in the distraction of our management, disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in our operations, services, quality standards, controls, procedures or policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated strategic or financial benefits of the relevant transactions or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

We compete principally on the basis of material science expertise, proprietary formulations, product innovation and technology, product quality and reliability, breadth of product offerings, manufacturing ability and footprint, customer service, regulatory expertise, delivery times, order fulfillment and price. Some of our competitors are larger, have greater financial resources and are less leveraged than us. As a result, these competitors may be better able to withstand a change in market conditions within the industry and throughout the economy as a whole. Additionally, a number of our solutions are customized or sold for highly specialized uses. Competitors that have greater financial, technological, manufacturing and marketing resources and that do not currently market similar applications for these uses could choose to do so in the future. Certain of our competitors are smaller companies that may have lower operating costs and greater operational flexibility. Changes within the healthcare and consumer products industries, including the consolidation of our competitors, suppliers, customers and other companies in the distribution channels for our products, have occurred and may continue to occur. We may also experience similar competitive factors and a resulting loss in sales if customers vertically integrate into our product lines. As a result of the foregoing factors, we may lose customers or be forced to reduce prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, as described elsewhere in this offering circular, we have manufacturing operations in China. Products or components that we manufacture in, or source from, China may be subject to the import tariffs currently in place with respect to certain goods imported from China under Sections 201 and 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974 and Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the “Tariff Act”). These tariffs, in particular the anti-dumping and countervailing duties imposed pursuant to the Tariff Act on imports of aluminum foil from China (the “China Foil Duties”), have impacted and continue to impact the cost of the aluminum foil available to purchase from China for our barrier solutions and liner, lidding and pouching applications in the United States. Additionally, on July 18, 2022, pursuant to the Tariff Act, the Department of Commerce self-initiated a case alleging that certain aluminum foil assembled or completed in Thailand and South Korea using Chinese aluminum foil and/or sheet, that is subsequently exported from South Korea and Thailand to the United States (the “Thai/Korean Foil”), is circumventing the China Foil Duties. On March 16, 2023, the Department of Commerce made a preliminary affirmative determination that certain imports of Thai/Korean Foil circumvent the China Foil Duties. Although there may be exceptions to the imposition of duties on the Thai/Korean Foil, duties on purchases of such foil could be as much as about 108%. Subject to any changes made by the Department of Commerce in its final determination decision scheduled for August 2, 2023, the imposition of duties from the preliminary finding of circumvention by the Department of Commerce apply retroactively to purchases of Thai/Korean Foil made from and after July 18, 2022, and will continue to apply to future purchases of foil from these countries. Future initiatives by the Department of Commerce or other governmental authorities may impose additional duties and tariffs on raw materials and other goods that we import. Although we have generally been able to either locate alternative sources of aluminum foil or pass these increased costs along to customers in the past, we are not contractually entitled to do so in all cases, and we may not be able to consistently pass along such costs or locate additional sources of aluminum foil in the quality and quantity required in the future. Some of our competitors may be able to offer certain products on more favorable terms as a result of their ability to avoid these tariffs by sourcing component parts or products from suppliers outside of China or other affected countries, or manufacturing component parts or products outside of China or other affected countries, or because their jurisdiction ----- of organization outside the U.S. affords them a competitive advantage when shipping into the U.S. market. Although we do not expect that these tariffs will have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations overall, if our competitors or new entrants structure their businesses around these tariffs in a manner that results in the prices of our products being less attractive to customers, or if the current presidential administration elects to expand the scope or size of these tariffs in a manner that results in significant additional costs to us that we are not able to pass along to our customers or otherwise mitigate, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See “— We are subject to risks associated with our foreign operations and revenues”. Loss of revenues from our key customers would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our five largest customers accounted for 19.2% of Net Sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, with our largest customer accounting for 10.6% of Net Sales. The loss or reduction in orders from any of these customers, whether due to competition or for other reasons, such as a deterioration in the financial condition of a customer, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

An inability to source our supplies could lead to reduced sales and increased costs.,"We rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain of our product lines. For example, a portion of our production of laminates for blister packaging is substantially dependent on our purchase of polychlorotrifluoroethylene (“PCTFE”) film from a single supplier. Other sources of PCTFE film are available, but are not sufficient to satisfy our requirements. An inability to obtain PCTFE film would significantly curtail our sales of laminates for blister packaging. Additionally, our Net Sales to Keurig Dr Pepper, representing approximately 10.5% of our Net Sales for fiscal year 2022, are substantially dependent on our purchase of a specialty tie layer material from a single supplier. Similarly, our supply agreement with DuPont Specialty Products USA, LLC and Company (“DuPont”) for Tyvek products is terminable, among other reasons, upon mutual agreement amongst the parties, and will terminate, by its terms, on December 31, 2024, if not renewed or amended. If we or DuPont terminate the supply agreement, we will be unable to satisfy our requirements for Tyvek products from other suppliers. In addition, we purchase a variety of other materials for which there may be a sole or limited approved source of supply and our inability to obtain any such materials could have an adverse impact on our financial condition. We may need to obtain customer approval to use an alternative material, which may take significant time, during which time we may suffer a loss of sales and/or the customer may seek an alternative supplier. In the event we were unable to renew our agreements with our suppliers or they were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide important materials in the required volumes and quality levels, in a timely manner and on generally favorable terms, we would be required to identify and obtain acceptable replacement supply sources. We may not be able to obtain alternative suppliers or vendors in a timely manner, or at all, which could disrupt or delay, or halt altogether, our ability to manufacture or deliver our products.

Weakened global economic conditions and other externals factors, such as inflationary pressures, could have an adverse impact on our business in the form of unfavorable changes in sales volumes, product price/mix, lower profit margins, and collection of accounts receivable. In periods of low world-wide demand for our products, we experience lower capacity utilization rates in our operations, which can lead to reduced margins during that period and can have an adverse effect on our business. During extended periods of economic recession, there can be a heightened competitive environment for sales and increased pressure to reduce selling prices. If we lose significant sales volume or have to reduce our selling prices significantly, there could be a negative impact on our revenue, profitability and cash flows. Economic and political conditions in countries in which we operate, including conflicts, wars, terrorist acts or security operations, may also adversely impact our operations. Also, economic conditions and disruptions in the credit markets could harm the liquidity or financial position of our customers and suppliers, which could in turn cause such parties to fail to meet their contractual or other obligations to us or reduce our customers’ purchases from us. Our production and supply chains could also be severely affected if our employees or the regions in which our facilities or suppliers are located are affected by a significant outbreak of any disease, epidemic or pandemic including COVID-19. In addition, local, national or international transportation or other infrastructure could be affected, leading to delays or loss of production. Furthermore, our suppliers and customers are subject to similar risks, which could lead to a shortage of materials or a reduction in our customers’ demand for our services. In particular, unfavorable economic conditions in Europe and Latin America could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions. The economies of the European and Latin American countries in which we operate may not experience growth in the future and an increase in demand for our products and services in these markets may not occur. In addition, we may not be able to sustain our current revenue or profit levels if adverse economic events or circumstances occur or continue to occur in the European or Latin American countries in which we operate. Uncertainty remains as to how the exit of the United Kingdom (“UK”) from the European Union (commonly known as “Brexit”) will affect the legal and regulatory environment in the European Union and the UK, as well as whether other countries in the European Union may approve similar measures and cause further uncertainty in the region. The post-Brexit UK-European Union relationship is under strain, with differences in terms of Northern Ireland and the border and immigration arrangements between the two. We have operations in Northern Ireland and in the European Union. We cannot yet fully predict the full implications of Brexit, including whether it will increase our operational costs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Pricing of our key materials, such as polystyrene, polyvinylchloride resin and plasticizers, has fluctuated primarily with the price of crude oil, although supply and demand factors from other precursors within the petrochemical chain can influence short-term price fluctuations. We use electrical power and natural gas to manufacture our products. These energy sources are vital to our operations and we rely on a continuous power supply to conduct our business. Energy prices are subject to considerable volatility and are subject to capacity constraints, and we are not able to predict to what extent energy prices will vary in the future or to the extent that the supply of energy could be constrained. We use aluminum in some of our products, and may be subject to tariffs if we do not obtain necessary waivers or exemptions from the U.S. federal government. While we have obtained such relief in the past, it is only temporary, and we must re-apply for relief from time to time. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining relief in the future. Absent relief, aluminum imports are currently subject ----- to a 10% tariff. Additionally, in 2021 Congress enacted the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which reinstated two environmental excise taxes which took effect in July 2022. These excise taxes may create additional costs that we will attempt to pass through to our customers, but there can be no guarantee that we will be successful. With our recent expansion into molded fiber products, we must acquire fiber feedstock, where prices may be volatile due to supply limitations and logistics costs. Our ability to maintain gross margin levels on our products during periods of rising raw material costs and higher energy costs depends on our ability to increase prices on our products to our customers. Furthermore, inflationary pressures may lead to higher prices of our key raw materials and energy and a decrease in consumer spending, both of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The results of operations for individual quarters can be, and have been, negatively impacted by delays between the timing of raw material and energy costs increases and price increases for our products. We are generally able to pass through increases in raw material costs, though most of such increases are not made pursuant to contractual rights. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the selling price increases we have already implemented or achieve any future price increases, and if we are not able to maintain or increase prices, it may harm our operating results by reducing our sales. We are dependent on third-party suppliers for all of our raw materials. Our five largest suppliers accounted for approximately one-third of our raw material purchases during fiscal year 2022. We are dependent on the ability of our suppliers to provide raw materials on a timely basis and on favorable pricing terms.

As a U.S. domiciled company, escalating FCPA enforcement in recent years and increased cooperation among federal and international regulators presents particular risks with respect to our business activities outside the United States, to the degree that any employee or other person acting on our behalf might offer, authorize, or make an improper payment to a foreign government official, party official, candidate for political office, political party, an employee of a foreign state-owned or statecontrolled enterprise, an employee of a public international organization or any other person to obtain or retain business. Moreover, in many foreign countries, particularly in certain developing economies, it is not uncommon to encounter business practices that are prohibited by certain regulations, such as laws relating to anti-corruption, including, for example, the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act and similar laws. Therefore, certain countries in which we operate may be deemed to present heightened risks from an anticorruption perspective. We have manufacturing operations in the United States, Belgium, Italy, Northern Ireland, Germany, Costa Rica, Brazil, India, Canada, Mexico, Colombia and China, and a third-party contract manufacturing facility in Argentina, and our products are sold to customers in over 80 countries. In addition, we use third-party sales agents in some of our business areas. Although we do not have significant sales to or purchases from government agencies or government owned/controlled enterprises, we do require local permits for our business operations, and we do need to move goods across a number of borders.

If we do not respond appropriately to these changes, it could negatively impact market demand, market share and pricing, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.","Certain of our products are directly or indirectly affected by government regulation. For example, a substantial amount of our products are sold for use in plastic packaging and in recent years there have been bans on certain uses of plastics implemented in various jurisdictions, including within the United States and the European Union. If legislative developments favor the use of alternatives to our products, our results of operations may materially suffer. In the United States bans on polystyrene food packaging have been implemented at both state and municipal levels. In most cases, these bans impact food service products such as take out containers, rather than egg cartons or processor trays. Changes in, or new interpretations of, existing laws, regulations or enforcement policies, as well as any new local or state-wide regulations seeking to ban or limit food service or other polystyrene applications, may create other barriers to sales of our polystyrene products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, several states have adopted “extended producer responsibility” laws that impose various obligations on the producers of plastic and other materials to address the various costs associated with the use, disposal and/or recycling of such materials. The European Union has adopted a circular economy package. The package maps out a series of actions planned over several years. Some actions have resulted in regulations aimed to reduce marine litter, increase plastic recycling rates, prohibit single-use plastic packaging and introduce new taxes in relation to the end-of-life management of packaging. Proposed regulations in the European Union may limit or forbid the use of various materials, including fluoropolymers used in some of our healthcare barrier products. These laws and regulations may expand in scope, and expand worldwide. Independent of any government regulation, consumer preferences may also drive trends that favor or disfavor different materials and solutions. There has also been increasing legislative action and consumer sentiment against the use of perand polyfluorinated substances (“PFAS”). While we do not incorporate PFAS into our products, at least one of our facilities may use it in certain applications as a processing aid, and we are working to identify an alternative processing aid. We may be exposed to liabilities associated with PFAS due to our supply chain. For example, we have recently identified a supplier that uses PFAS in its manufacturing process, and we cannot preclude the possibility that residual PFAS may carry over into our own finished goods. Our supplier has developed PFAS-free substitutes and we are planning to sample them in our manufacturing. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify every instance of PFAS in our supply chain, or to the extent we do, that we will be able to identify alternative solutions. In addition to the rules regarding plastic, polystyrene products and PFAS, our operations are subject to various other U.S. and foreign environmental statutes and regulations, including those relating to: (i) other materials used in our products; (ii) discharge of pollutants into the air, water and soil; (iii) treatment, transport, storage and disposal of hazardous materials or hazardous wastes; and (iv) chemical and product safety as well as employee health and safety matters. We are also required by these laws and regulations to obtain registrations, licenses, permits, and other approvals in order to ----- operate, and to make disclosures to public authorities about our chemical handling and usage activities. These laws and regulations may become more stringent over time and the failure to comply with such laws and regulations can result in significant fines or penalties. Further, our facilities are periodically subject to investigation by governmental regulators. Future expenditures may increase as compliance standards or technologies change, or as laws change. We presently, and will continue to, evaluate the need for capital projects required in order to maintain or achieve compliance with environmental laws applicable to our business. Such compliance efforts could result in significant expense or in changes to our manufacturing operations or product formulations. Such laws and regulations may also impact the availability of materials used in manufacturing our products, such as the disposable plastics and polystyrene products discussed above, which could result in a need to reformulate products. Such additional costs or new product formulations could make our products less competitive with products made from other materials. We cannot be certain that we have identified all environmental compliance matters giving rise to potential costs liability.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

Further, under these laws, liability can be imposed for arranging for the disposal of hazardous substances or wastes at a third-party site that becomes contaminated. Liability under CERCLA and analogous laws is strict, unlimited, joint, several, retroactive, may be imposed regardless of fault and may relate to historical activities or contamination not caused by the affected property’s current owner or operator. In addition, we may face liability for personal injury, property damage and natural resource damage resulting from environmental conditions attributable to hazardous substance releases at or from facilities we currently or formerly owned or operated or to which we sent waste. In some jurisdictions, such as New Jersey, an obligation to investigate and possibly remediate contamination at current or former facilities can arise upon the occurrence of certain events such as a property or business sale. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a $70,000 reserve associated with environmental remediation obligations for the Burlington, New Jersey site that we sold. We also provided the buyer of this property with indemnification against certain remediation costs that they may incur in the future. To date we have not received any such indemnification claims from the buyer. In 2019, we acquired three manufacturing facilities from Amcor and became the operator of a Milwaukee, Wisconsin facility where remediation efforts related to chlorinated volatile organic compound contamination are ongoing under the supervision of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. The property owner has been performing and funding remediation at the property. Although the lease does not provide for indemnification in the event we are subject to liability pursuant to certain statutes or regulations or in connection with tort claims, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has recognized that we are not responsible for the existing contamination. Amcor agreed to indemnify us for liabilities related to prior contamination at the Milwaukee facility, but we and Amcor may not agree on the scope of such indemnification.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

These compounds are volatile and may increase our risk of experiencing an explosion or fire. Many of these compounds are subject to limits imposed by certain governmental regulatory bodies. As such, we are required to capture and destroy these compounds to limit release into the environment. While we use various safety measures to mitigate the risks posed by these compounds, we have experienced butanerelated fires in the past, and there can be no assurance that we will not experience another such event in ----- the future.

These laws are subject to change at any time and certain agreements may not be fully enforceable, which could restrict our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, intellectual property laws can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important principles remain unresolved. We market our products internationally, and because of the differences in foreign laws, our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they would in the United States. Our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have applied for, and expect to continue to apply for, patent protection in the United States and in foreign countries. The process of applying for and obtaining a patent is expensive, time-consuming and complex, and we may not be able to file, prosecute, maintain, enforce or license all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, or in all jurisdictions where protection may be commercially advantageous. Our patent applications may not result in issued patents and our patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage. Other parties may have developed technologies that may be related or competitive to our products, may have or obtain patents that conflict with our patents or technology and may have patents that could prevent us from making, using, or selling our products (even where we may own patents that also cover the same products). Further, our patents do not ensure that competitors will not develop competing products, design around our patents or infringe upon our patents. The costs to defend or assert our patents or other intellectual property rights could be substantial and may outweigh the benefits of enforcing our rights. In any of these types of proceedings, a court or agency may find our patents invalid or unenforceable, which could thereby allow our competitors to market products and use technology substantially similar to ours. We rely on our trademarks, trade names, and brand names to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors, and we have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks. We cannot assure you that our trademark applications will be approved or that we have applied for all the trademarks in the jurisdictions and classes of goods and services that are or will be material to our business. Third parties may also oppose our trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Further, competitors may infringe our trademarks, and we may not have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks. We also face risks in connection with our international expansion, including in countries that may have less protection for our trademarks than the United States. There is a risk that our trademarks may not be adequate to protect our brands or may conflict with the trademarks of other companies, both domestically and abroad, which may require us to rebrand our products, obtain costly licenses, or defend against third-party claims. Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other government fees on any registered intellectual property and certain applications therefor are required to be paid. The process of obtaining and maintaining registered intellectual property also involves a number of other procedural, documentary, and other similar requirements. Noncompliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of our registered intellectual property or applications therefor include failure to respond to official communications within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. While an inadvertent lapse in many cases can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which non-compliance can result in irrevocable abandonment, lapse or other loss. If we fail to properly maintain ----- our registered intellectual property or applications therefor, our competitors might be able to enter the market with similar or identical products, technologies or brands, which could substantially harm our business. We also rely heavily on trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented proprietary technology. It is possible that others may independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology, which could diminish our competitive position. We anticipate many of our trade secrets will be disseminated over time within the industry through independent development, the publication of journal articles describing the methodology and movement of personnel. To protect our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information, we typically require employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements with us. We may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our trade secrets despite the existence of these confidentiality agreements, and these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of this proprietary information. Even if a party is known to us to have breached its confidentiality obligations owed to us, legal and other remedies will often be inadequate as our trade secrets will have already been exposed to the broader industry. Despite the protections we do place on our trade secrets, know-how or other unpatented proprietary technology, monitoring unauthorized use and disclosure of our intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate. In addition, while we may require our employees, contractors, collaborators or other third parties who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. We also may be subject to claims that former or current employees, contractors, collaborators or other third parties have, or allege to have, an ownership interest in our intellectual property. Costly litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership and we may not be successful and could be required to pay damages and lose valuable intellectual property. Additionally, we have licensed, and may license in the future, patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights from third parties, and the licenses we receive to such intellectual property rights may not provide exclusive or unrestricted rights in all fields of use and in all territories in which we may wish to develop or commercialize our products in the future and may restrict our rights to offer certain products in certain markets or impose other obligations on us in exchange for our rights to the licensed intellectual property. If we violate the terms of any of our license agreements, such as by failing to make specified royalty payments or failing to comply with quality control standards, a licensor may have the right to terminate our license. Even if we comply with all the terms of a license agreement, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew an agreement when it expires even if we desire to do so. The failure to maintain or renew our license agreements could result in a loss of revenue and negatively impact our results of operations. Our ability to protect our trademarks, patents and other intellectual property may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain domestic and foreign intellectual property offices have amended their filing requirements and other procedures, including, but not limited to, extending deadlines and waiving fees. These accommodations have not been applied uniformly across all intellectual property offices globally, and the effectiveness and duration of existing action is unclear. Further, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created uncertainty with respect to the uninterrupted operation of domestic and foreign intellectual property offices, which, amongst other things, may cause delayed processing of renewal and application filings. Our inability to establish and maintain current and future trademarks, patents or other intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on the growth and reputation of our business. Further, the constantly evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic may change its effect on our brand and our other intellectual property rights over time in ways that cannot be reasonably anticipated or mitigated. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

The conduct of our business, including actions taken in relation to our business by our suppliers, partners, customers and other third parties, may nevertheless infringe, misappropriate or violate the intellectual property of others and third parties may bring, or threaten to bring, infringement or similar suits against us. Any actual or threatened claims of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or other violation, even those without merit or that we are able to successfully defend, could be expensive and time consuming to defend and respond to, cause us to cease production or the sale of certain products, require us to redesign, reengineer or rebrand our products or packaging, divert management’s attention and resources, or require us to enter into costly licensing arrangements to obtain the right to use a third party’s intellectual property. Any licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Even if we believe such third-party claims are without merit, a court may hold that we, or parties that we are contractually obligated to indemnify, have infringed, misappropriated or violated third-party intellectual property rights or we may settle claims to avoid the cost and uncertainty of litigation. Furthermore, any such successful claim against us could also result in our being required to pay significant damages and enjoin us from continuing to make, use or sell certain of technologies, brands, or products. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations and our ability to establish or maintain a competitive advantage may also be diminished because of these uncertainties. Even if intellectual property claims brought by or against us are settled or resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal, governmental or administrative proceedings relating to intellectual property claims, or the mere threat thereof, may cause us to incur significant expenses and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities. There is also a risk that in connection with defending against intellectual property claims brought against us or otherwise, the validity, enforceability or scope of patents and other intellectual property that we own or license may be successfully challenged or limited. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our trade secrets or other confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, which could be perceived by our suppliers, customers or other parties to be negative and result in temporary or permanent disruptions to our supply chains, customer demand, or other operations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

The consequences of ----- a product not meeting these standards, due to, among other things, accidental or malicious raw materials contamination or due to supply chain contamination caused by human error or equipment fault, could be severe. Such consequences might include adverse effects on consumer health, litigation exposures, loss of market share, negative publicity, financial costs and loss of revenues. In addition, if our products fail to meet applicable standards, we may be required to incur substantial costs in taking appropriate corrective action (up to and including recalling products from consumers) and to reimburse customers and/or end consumers for losses that they suffer as a result of this failure. Customers and end consumers may seek to recover these losses through litigation and, under applicable legal rules, and may succeed in any such claim despite there being no negligence or other fault on our part. We maintain insurance for product liability claims, but the amount and scope of our insurance may not be adequate to cover a product liability claim that is successfully asserted against us. Any product liability claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our product liability insurance only covers certain product recall costs. In addition, product liability insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and, in the future, may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, we are exposed to the product liability risk and other potential negative publicity affecting our customers and suppliers. Because many of our customers produce food, pharmaceutical or medical products, including with their own product liability risks, our sales may decline if any of our customers are sued on a product liability claim, if they halt production or recall products voluntarily or involuntarily due to safety concerns, or if they are otherwise subject to negative publicity.

Our products may also be subject to analogous regulatory regimes in other countries. Failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements can lead to sanctions and enforcement actions by the FDA and other governmental entities, including warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, consent decrees and civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, our failure to comply with laws and regulations generally could have a significant adverse impact on our customers’ business. Some of our customers use our products as components of their medical devices or in the packaging of pharmaceutical, food, cosmetic and nutraceutical products. The FDA may require premarket review and approval of our customers’ products, and our failure to comply with laws and regulations could result in the rejection of our customers’ marketing applications for products in which our components and offerings are incorporated. If the FDA were to bring an enforcement action against us or our customers, or fail to approve or clear our customers’ products whether due to the failure of our products to comply with applicable regulations, our customers’ specifications or otherwise, our business could be significantly harmed, and negative publicity could harm our or our customers’ ability to sell any regulated products. Additionally, any changes in applicable laws, regulations or interpretations thereof could adversely affect us and our customers, have an adverse impact on our revenues and, if we fail to adequately comply with such changes, result in government sanctions. Generally, our customers are ultimately responsible for the compliance of their medical devices and pharmaceutical products from a regulatory perspective, including compliance of such products with current good manufacturing practices for drugs and the FDA’s Quality System Regulation for medical devices. However, we may agree to comply with certain requirements by contract, and, if we fail to do so, we could jeopardize the compliance status of our customers’ products, experience a loss in sales and customers and be exposed to contract and product liability claims. Certain of our food packaging materials are subject to FDA regulation. For example, the FDA regulates “food contact substances”, which the FDA defines to include any substance that is intended for use as a component of materials used in manufacturing, packing, packaging, transporting or holding food if such use of the substance is not intended to have any technical effect in such food. The FDA also regulates “food additives”, which the FDA defines to include any substance the intended use of which results or may reasonably be expected to result, directly or indirectly, in its becoming a component or otherwise affecting the characteristic of any food (including substances intended for packaging). The FDA imposes requirements with respect to these substances, including, in some cases, pre-market review requirements. Although, we require that the manufacturers of the raw materials who supply to us comply with and satisfy any food contact substance and food additive requirements, such as any requirements to submit and seek FDA review of a food contact notification or food additive petition, we have only limited control over our suppliers’ activities, and any failure by us or our suppliers to adhere to applicable food safety regulations could result in enforcement action or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business. We maintain Drug Master Files (“DMFs”) with the FDA, which are submissions that may be made to the FDA containing detailed information about the facilities, processes or articles used in the manufacturing, processing, packaging, and storage of human drugs products. The submission and maintenance of a DMF is a mechanism to allow our customers to share data in connection with the FDA’s review of regulatory filings and applications for our customers’ products without sharing our proprietary information directly with our customers.

Any actual or perceived inability to adequately address cybersecurity, to comply with contractual or other legal obligations, or event that leads to access, use, disclosure or loss or alteration of data could result in loss of data, legal claims or proceedings, regulatory investigation, enforcement actions, regulatory fines, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, impair our ability to conduct business, or result in the loss or diminished value of profitable opportunities. If personal data were misappropriated, our reputation could be injured, and we could incur costs to compensate individuals or pay damages or fines as a result of litigation or regulatory actions arising out of any such incident. Additionally, many jurisdictions have also enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving their personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach are costly to implement and often lead to widespread negative publicity, which may cause our customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our cybersecurity measures. For additional discussion regarding these laws more generally, see “— Failure To Comply With Laws Relating To The Processing Of Data About Individuals May Require ----- Us To Make Changes To Our Products Or Incur Penalties Or Other Liabilities”. Data security incidents could also lead to an increase in insurance premiums. The data centers supporting our information technology infrastructure are located around the world in different facilities. Any one of these facilities may be susceptible to damage or interruption due to human error, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure or other events. Any failure or interruption of our information technology systems, including due to any such events at the data center supporting our systems, could impair our ability to conduct routine operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, our information technology systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems in order for us to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving legal and regulatory standards (including the increasing need to protect personal data), changes in the techniques used by hostile actors to obtain unauthorized access to data and information systems, and the information technology needs associated with our changing products and services.

Many federal, state and foreign governmental bodies and agencies have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws and regulations that impose limits on the collection, processing, use, disclosure and security of data about individuals. In some cases, such laws and regulations can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities. In addition, privacy advocacy and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards or guidance that may legally or contractually apply to us and our vendors. These non-uniform laws, regulations, standards and guidance are complex and currently evolving and can be subject to significant change and interpretation, and may be inconsistently applied and enforced from one jurisdiction to another. The pace of such laws and regulations and guidance has been increasing in recent years, with a number of laws impacting our ability to collect, share and use personal information, including, for example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, as also applied in the United Kingdom by virtue of the United Kingdom’s Data Protection Act, which imposes a host of data privacy and security requirements, imposing significant costs on us and carrying substantial penalties for non-compliance. Although we take reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to regulatory action. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any applicable data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings, complaints, investigations or actions (including class actions) brought against us by governmental entities/agencies or private individuals/entities, significant fines, penalties, judgments, orders requiring us to change business practices, public criticism, loss of customers, loss of goodwill or other additional liabilities, such as claims by industry groups or other third parties. This could result in reputational damage to our business and/or increasing the costs and complexity of compliance. As privacy and data protection laws and regulations continue to evolve, we may incur additional costs to ensure that we remain in compliance with those laws and regulations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

The loss or departure of any key members of our management team could be detrimental to our future success. Further, the process of attracting and retaining suitable replacements for key personnel whose services we may lose would result in transition costs and would divert ----- attention of other members of our senior management from our existing operations.

Changes in the respective currency exchange rates in these countries will affect the value of the reported earnings and the value of those assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. For example, an increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro would reduce our Euro-denominated revenue when reported in U.S. Dollars, our functional reporting currency. Our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected by such exchange rate fluctuations.

Pension Plan (the “U.S. Pension Plan”), a defined benefit pension plan that is funded to 99% year-to-date as of the quarter ended December 31, 2022. This is a slight decrease from 103% funded earlier in the year due to market changes. The Company has initiated an asset liability immunization strategy to take advantage of the current environment. We have assets in the U.S. Pension Plan which arise through employer contributions and returns on investments made by the plan. The return on investment is subject to fluctuations depending upon market conditions and we are responsible for funding any shortfall of pension assets compared to our pension obligations under the U.S. Pension Plan. Our liability under the U.S. Pension Plan is estimated based on actuarial and other assumptions. These assumptions may prove to be incorrect and may change over time and the effect of these changes can be material. Our current funding policy is to contribute no less frequently than annually an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required by law. Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and pension contributions in future periods. For example, a reduction in pension assets due to declines in the equity markets or an increase in pension liabilities due to reductions in long term corporate bond yields could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing pension contributions. GAAP requires that we determine income or expense for the plans based upon actuarial valuations reflecting current pension assets and credit market conditions. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets based on economic conditions. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the “PBGC”), has the authority to terminate an underfunded tax-qualified pension plan under limited circumstances. In the event the U.S. Pension Plan is terminated by the PBGC, we could be liable to the PBGC for the entire amount of the underfunding.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

Fluctuations in federal, state, local and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions, including related interest and penalties, may increase our effective tax rate and materially impact our financial results. In addition, federal, state and local tax laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although we believe our tax positions are reasonable, if the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or another taxing authority disagrees with our interpretation of tax law as applied to our operations or with the positions we take with respect to particular tax issues on our tax returns, we could have additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. When particular tax matters ----- arise, it may take a significant amount of time before such matters are audited and finally resolved. Unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase our effective tax rate, result in significant costs, including penalties and interest and could have an adverse effect on our operating results.

Some of our ERP and information technology systems currently are, and may become, no longer supported by the original vendors or other information technology professionals. In addition, some of our information technology or ERP systems may not remain available on terms acceptable to us and may require replacement, which could result in substantial operational expense and diversion of our resources. The failure of our information technology and ERP systems to remain in continuous operation as designed could substantially disrupt our business. These systems are vulnerable to breakdown or other interruption or damage from a variety of sources, such as system malfunctions, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures.

However, the guarantees by the subsidiary guarantors are limited to the maximum amount that the subsidiary guarantors are permitted to guarantee under applicable law. As a result, a subsidiary guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be reduced to zero, depending upon the amount of other obligations of such subsidiary guarantor. Further, under the circumstances discussed more fully below, a court under federal and state fraudulent conveyance and transfer statutes could void the obligations under a guarantee or further subordinate it to all other obligations of the guarantor. See “— Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to void the notes and the guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes and the guarantees and require note holders to return payments received and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes”.

Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the notes or guarantees could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if: (i) the Issuer ----- or any of the guarantors, as applicable, issued the notes or incurred the guarantees with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (ii) the Issuer or any of the guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either issuing the notes or incurring the guarantees and, in the case of (ii) only, one of the following is also true at the time thereof: - the Issuer or any of the guarantors, as applicable, was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the guarantees; - the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the guarantees left the Issuer or any of the guarantors, as applicable, with an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on the business; - the Issuer or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that the Issuer or such guarantor would, incur debts beyond the Issuer’s or such guarantor’s ability to pay such debts as they mature; or - the Issuer or any of the guarantors was a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for money damages docketed against it or such guarantor if, in either case, after final judgment, the judgment is unsatisfied. A court would likely find that the Issuer or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes or such guarantee if the Issuer or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes or the applicable guarantee. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or an antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. A debtor will generally not be considered to have received value in connection with a debt offering if the debtor uses the proceeds of that offering to make a dividend payment or otherwise retire or redeem equity securities issued by the debtor. The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law being applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred, such that we cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not the Issuer or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that a court would not determine that the Issuer or a guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not the Issuer or a guarantor was insolvent on the date the notes or the guarantee was issued, that any payments to holders of the notes or in connection with a guarantee constituted preferences or fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds, or the notes or the guarantees would not be further subordinated to the Issuer’s or any of the guarantors’ other debt. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the guarantees was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or such guarantees or further subordinate the notes or such guarantees to presently existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer or of the related guarantors, or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to such guarantees. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the notes or such guarantees, as applicable. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, including any remaining guarantors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from us or the guarantors. Further, the voidance of the notes could result in an event of default with respect to the Issuer’s and its subsidiaries’ other debt that could result in acceleration of such debt. ----- If the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could also be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the applicable guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than fair consideration. A court could thus void the obligations under the guarantees, subordinate them to the applicable guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of the notes. Although each guarantee entered into by a subsidiary will contain a provision intended to limit that guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer, this provision may not be effective to protect those guarantees from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless. A recent court decision found a similar limitation was ineffective to preserve the enforceability of a guarantee. In addition, any payment by us pursuant to the notes or by a guarantor under a guarantee made at a time we or such guarantor were found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to us or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of our or such guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any outside party and such payment would give such insider or outsider party more than such creditors would have received in a distribution under the Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case. Finally, as a court of equity, a bankruptcy court may otherwise subordinate the claims in respect of the notes or the guarantees to other claims against us or the guarantors under the principle of equitable subordination, if the court determines that: (i) the holder of the notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (ii) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holder of the notes; and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

376_2,Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Business Outlooks and Trends Critical Accounting Policies,17.4.2,Goodwill and intangible assets,"The Company performs an annual impairment test of goodwill for each reporting unit during the second quarter of its fiscal year. In applying the goodwill impairment test, the Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for the Company’s products and services, regulatory and political developments, and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance. If, after completing the qualitative assessment or the Company elects to skip the qualitative assessment, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company proceeds to a quantitative impairment test. Intangible assets may be subject to impairment charges. Intangible assets acquired through acquisitions are initially measured at fair value and any changes in expectations used in the valuation of such intangible assets could potentially lead to an impairment. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment. The more significant judgments and assumptions made to determine the fair value of the Company’s reporting units were (1) the amount and timing of expected future cash flows which are based primarily on the Company’s estimates of future sales, earnings, taxes and investments, (2) the expected long-term growth rates for each of the Company’s reporting units, (3) discount rates that are used to discount future cash flows to their present values, and (4) the determination of appropriate earnings multiples used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value under the market approach and the selection of appropriate comparable companies for each reporting unit to be used for purposes of determining those multiples. In-process research and development (“IPRD”) that has not reached commercialization is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate a potential reduction in the fair values of the assets below their carrying value. If the carrying value of IPRD is determined to exceed the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. At June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no material intangible assets with indefinite lives other than goodwill and in-process research and development. Definite-lived intangible assets, including customer relationships, know-how, developed technology and trademarks and trade names are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Estimated useful lives are determined considering the period in which the assets are expected to contribute to future cash flows and generally range from seven to 20 years. Intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable over their estimated useful life. When a triggering event for impairment is identified, the Company compares the carrying value of the relevant assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. When the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than their carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. To determine fair value, the Company principally uses internal discounted cash flow estimates, but also uses quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value at the valuation date. Cash flow estimates are derived from historical experience and internal business plans with an appropriate discount rate applied. The Company evaluates the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

Management must make judgments about such uncertainties and determine estimates of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates, which the Company expects will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. While management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities, which could be material. The Company is also required to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets. The Company evaluates all positive and negative evidence and uses judgments regarding past and future events, including operating results and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, the Company determines when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of its deferred tax assets may not be realized, in which case the Company records a valuation allowance to offset its deferred tax assets in an amount equal to future tax benefits that may not be realized. To the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. The Company establishes additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the Company is examined by various Federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of the provision for income taxes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

Previously, the Company had been organized under three lines of business: Healthcare, Specialty Packaging and Food Packaging. Presentation for fiscal year 2020 has been recast and prepared by us for comparability purposes and has not been reviewed or audited by our auditors. Net Sales increased $34.3 million, or 3.3%, to $1,075.1 million in fiscal year 2021 compared to $1,040.8 million in fiscal year 2020. The increase in Net Sales was primarily the result of higher organic growth volumes within the Consumer Products division. This growth was augmented by the first quarter incremental contribution of sales from our acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of MMC in September 2019, higher average selling prices across portions of the business, and favorable foreign exchange rates with respect to European-based operations when compared to fiscal year 2020. This was partially offset by lower sales volumes within the Healthcare division, together with lower sales from our Gallarate, Italy plant as production continued to ramp up following the initial disruption in business operations due to a fire in late March 2020. In addition, foreign exchange rates were less favorable for our Brazilian operations compared to the prior year. Net Sales in our Healthcare division decreased by $25.9 million, or 5.7 %, to $425.2 million in fiscal year 2021 compared to $451.1 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to volume declines resulting from a COVID-19 driven decrease in elective surgery procedures, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rates as compared to fiscal year 2020. Net Sales in our Consumer Products division increased by $60.2 million, or 10.2%, to $649.9 million in fiscal year 2021 compared to $589.7 million in fiscal year 2020 primarily due to higher organic volumes across numerous portions of the business. The increase was also attributed to the first quarter incremental sales contribution from the MMC Packaging acquisition, offset, in part, by the loss of sales related to the temporary disruption in the production from our Gallarate, Italy plant due to a fire in late March 2020 together with the less favorable foreign exchange environment experienced in our South American operations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

376_2,Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.30,Sealing Film,17.30.1,Among the Leaders in Stable End Markets and Essential Product Categories,"We have a strong presence across both our primary divisions in the United States and internationally. Sales of substantially all of our products are traditionally stable throughout economic cycles. Some of the stable, long-term trends that drive demand across our key product categories include: aging and growing populations, increasing incidence of chronic diseases, trends toward less invasive surgical techniques, increasing demand for healthcare and certain of our consumer products in developing economies, new applications for dispensing packaging, drug patent expiration and the resulting conversion to use of generic drugs (which allows for greater competition and increased sales opportunities for our business), growth in disposable income in developing economies, increasing per capita fresh food consumption and the increasing use of protective packaging by retailers to reduce shrinkage. Our primary divisions have performed well in recent years and have demonstrated solid growth amidst significant disruptions in the global economy, providing us with a reliable source of cash flow. We have long-standing relationships with many of our customers that are strengthened because certain of our medical packaging and tubing products conform to FDA and U.S. Pharmacopeia (and European equivalent) standards. Our materials and products are used as critical enablers of customers’ medical devices and pharmaceutical products, and are also used by our customers as food packaging. For example, in the case of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, the safety and suitability of the solutions we offer may be reviewed as part of the FDA’s premarket approval or clearance process for the particular drug or device to the extent that premarket review is required for the product. As a result, once a new medical device or drug offering including our products has gained FDA clearance or approval, we may enjoy a competitive advantage over competing products that are not included in the cleared or approved device or drug in situations where modifying product packaging or other components requires FDA premarket review and authorization. Another source of competitive advantage is that many of our products utilize proprietary formulations that address the specific needs of individual customers that we believe cannot be readily replicated by other suppliers. We believe these proprietary formulations, coupled with our long-term customer relationships and high quality products and services, allow us to better serve our customers as compared to our competitors. Further, in our Consumer Products division, we believe that the high capital costs and high technical competence required for manufacturing processes encourage customers to partner with us on a long-term basis.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

Our divisions feature stable fundamentals, strong organic growth dynamics and non-cyclical recession-resistant trends. As a long-standing player in each of our primary divisions— technologically sophisticated, high value-added healthcare and consumer materials science solutions — supported by strong customer relationships, we have developed a deep understanding of the drivers of our organic growth and we focus on developing products to capitalize on these trends. Our Healthcare division is focused on the professional side of healthcare and strong growth is driven by aging and growing populations, increasing incidence of chronic diseases, trends toward less invasive surgical techniques and the increasing demand for professional healthcare solutions in developing economies. Many diseases are becoming more manageable, which is driving a trend of more doctor visits, medications and interventional treatments, all of which contribute to organic sales growth. An increasing onus on enabling more effective and shorter procedure recoveries drives demand for medical tubing. Growing emphasis on patient safety and sanitation creates demand for sterile disposable medical device applications. Drug delivery innovation requires new and unique materials science solutions. Increased demand for early screening and testing is fueling diagnostic testing component requirements. We are strategically indexed to such trends given our differentiated ability to combine and adapt materials and process technologies to deliver higher order solutions for our customers. As such, we seek to enhance our medical compound and medical tubing business by providing higher order solutions that meet the evolving and exacting quality needs for these clinical applications. Our customers typically prefer supplies local to where they operate, and we have addressed this market need by expanding our global footprint to produce medical compounds and medical tubing in the United States, Europe, Asia and Costa Rica. We are also positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for improved healthcare in emerging economies. For pharmaceutical applications, development of new drugs is a lengthy and costly process, which drives preference for proven suppliers with an established track record of quality and regulatory expertise. In addition, we strive to address the market need for higher levels of quality and product cleanliness by expanding cleanroom investments, especially in emerging markets. Within our Consumer Products division, growth trends in our fresh foods solutions business unit are driven by a strong consumer preference for fresher, healthier options in fast-growing “perimeter-ofstore” categories. Fresh food applications across retail, food service and processor channels ----- increasingly require specialized packaging features designed to extend shelf life, protect food and strengthen branding — augmenting end consumer demand with accelerating packaging penetration. Further, secular demand for sustainable materials utilizing fully recyclable, lighter-weight and/or recycled content materials creates an even greater need for materials science solutions which can deliver innovative, effective products to enable differentiated customer success in the marketplace. We are strategically indexed to such trends given our differentiated ability to combine and adapt materials and process technologies to deliver higher order solutions for our customers. Within our Consumer Products division, our integrated performance solutions business unit exhibits growth trends that are driven by consumer preferences for convenience and easy-opening features in their packaging and growth in disposable income. Consumers prefer more convenience in container and closure dispensing systems, so our customers design and develop products to address this market demand. In turn, we develop liners, gaskets, dip tubing and seals that assist our customers in their efforts to improve dispensing solutions.

We generate a stable and growing cash flow stream, driven by our diversification and exposure to defensive end markets. From fiscal year 2020 to the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, our Management Adjusted EBITDA has grown from $207.2 million to $359.9 million and our Net Sales increased from $1,040.8 million to $1,852.3 million. Operational savings and production efficiencies have been driven by standardization of manufacturing operations, safety best practice systems, the implementation of operational improvement frameworks, facility consolidation and manufacturing footprint improvements. Increasing productivity and disciplined price management have driven steady gross margins over time, translating to resilient free cash flows. With relatively low capital expenditure requirements — approximately $55 million for fiscal ----- year 2022, $54 million for fiscal year 2021 and $79 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 — our Combined Free Cash Flow has grown from $166 million in fiscal year 2021 to $296 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. Our high-return on investment, focused capital expenditure initiatives in the first half of fiscal year 2023 have helped us accelerate our growth outlook. Based on publicly available information, we believe that we have been able to maintain competitive margins compared to our direct competitors. Growth in our Combined Net Sales and Combined Adjusted EBITDA can be attributed to the following key factors: - Strong topline growth driven by increase in organic sales volumes within the Healthcare division and increased pricing levels across both divisions associated with input cost increases; - Healthcare: increase was primarily due to a combination of higher organic volumes, particularly in barrier solutions products in the Americas, and higher selling prices associated with rising input costs; - Consumer Products: increase was due to higher average selling prices associated with rising input costs across all businesses, partially offset by mixed impact in certain business units; - Commercial excellence driving pricing opportunities as we reorganized ourselves to be a proactive, market-driven solutions partner under one Tekni-Plex branded house; - Materials science expertise driving share-of-wallet gains and defending current share with diverse, growing customer base; - Effective supply chain management, which continues to be a key differentiator for our business; and - Differentiated value proposition, leveraging proprietary formulations, process versatility, trade secret knowledge base and market expertise. In addition to significant growth in sales, Combined Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow that we expect to generate from organic growth and continued cost reductions, we believe that our business platform is well positioned for additional strategic acquisition opportunities. We continue to leverage the customer relationships of recent acquisitions to target market share and geographic expansion opportunities in business lines and regions with high growth potential.

376_2,Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.42,Government Laws and Regulation,17.42.1,,"Our operations and the real property we own or lease are subject to broad governmental laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations by multiple jurisdictions. These laws and regulations pertain to employee health and safety, the discharge of certain materials into the environment, handling and disposition of waste, cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water, other rules to control pollution and manage natural resources, and other government regulations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable health and safety laws, environmental laws and regulations. However, we cannot predict with certainty that we will not, in the future, incur liability with respect to noncompliance with health and safety laws, environmental laws and regulations due to contamination of sites formerly or currently owned or operated by us (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites) or the off-site disposal of regulated materials, or other broad government regulations which could be significant. In addition, these laws and regulations are constantly changing, and we cannot always anticipate these changes. Certain of our products are directly or indirectly affected by government regulation. Bans on certain uses of plastics have been implemented in various jurisdictions, including within the United States and the European Union. In the United States, bans on polystyrene food packaging have been implemented at both state and municipal levels. In most cases, these bans impact food service products such as take out containers, rather than egg cartons or processor trays. In addition, several states have adopted “extended producer responsibility” laws that impose various obligations on the producers of plastic ----- and other materials to address the various costs associated with the use, disposal and/or recycling of such materials. The European Union has adopted a circular economy package. The package maps out a series of actions planned over several years. Some actions have resulted in regulations aimed to reduce marine litter, increase plastic recycling rates, prohibit single-use plastic packaging and introduce new taxes in relation to the end-of-life management of packaging. Proposed regulations in the European Union may limit or forbid the use of various materials, including fluoropolymers used in some of our healthcare barrier products. The potential exists for these types of laws and regulations to expand in scope, and to expand worldwide. Independent of any government regulation, consumer preferences may also drive trends that favor or disfavor different materials and solutions. In our Healthcare division, we work to ensure compliance with applicable regulations in determining the suitability for use of our products in medical devices, diagnostics, and pharmaceutical applications. Sterility and patient safety are top priorities. Currently, the use of reusable, recycled, post-content recycled content or bio-based materials is prohibited. Our product development also encompasses research on alternative materials; designing and sourcing raw materials from sustainable sources; and monitoring industry trends and regulations and their potential impact on our future raw material selection. In barrier pharmaceutical applications, our long-term strategy is to address sustainability needs in pharmaceutical blister solutions for oral solid dosage drugs. Traditional blister packaging cannot be recycled in conventional waste streams due to the aluminum/PVC construction. We have developed an innovative range of “recyclable” blister solutions that are fully compatible with polypropylene waste streams. We are working to obtain patent protection for these solutions, and to obtain third party certification of their recyclability. In the Consumer Products division, we have completed several acquisitions in molded fiber and paper forming capabilities. Our growing molded fiber-based solutions portfolio allows us to expand our offerings of renewable bio-based materials, responding to government regulation, our customers’ environmental goals, and evolving consumer preferences. Sustainability and product protection are essential drivers in our product development. Our GeoPack portfolio offers food packaging products comprising varying combinations of biodegradable or compostable materials, post-consumer recycled content, and recyclable substrates. In our integrated performance solutions business unit we have introduced a new dip tube, made of up to 100% post-consumer recycled content. As a business with a significant global footprint, we are also required to comply with evolving regulations and standards in data privacy and cybersecurity, which apply to our collection, sharing, use and protection of personal information. These laws and regulations continue to expand, differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and are subject to evolving (and at times inconsistent) governmental interpretation.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352
376_2,Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.43,Legal Proceedings and Environmental Matters,17.43.1,,"We are party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including those related to foreign tax matters, intellectual property claims and compliance with environmental regulations. While it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters, we believe that the final outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are subject to environmental laws requiring the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination. In addition to remediation being undertaken by third parties at a limited number of our locations, we are investigating and remediating existing environmental conditions resulting from past industrial activity at several of our facilities, including several of our New Jersey facilities pursuant to the requirements of New Jersey’s Industrial Site Recovery Act (“ISRA”). If any events were to occur in the future that would be deemed to have effected a transfer of ownership or operations of, or cessation of operations at, any of our New Jersey facilities that are defined under ISRA as an “industrial establishment”, we would be required to take additional actions to comply with that statute, possibly resulting in additional investigations and remediation costs. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a $70,000 reserve associated with environmental remediation obligations for the Burlington, New Jersey site that we sold. We also provided the buyer of ----- this property with indemnification against certain remediation costs that they may incur in the future. To date we have not received any such indemnification claims from the buyer. In 2019, we acquired three manufacturing facilities from Amcor and became the operator of a Milwaukee, Wisconsin facility where remediation efforts related to chlorinated volatile organic compound contamination are ongoing under the supervision of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. The property owner has been performing and funding remediation at the property. Although the lease does not provide for indemnification in the event we are subject to liability pursuant to certain statutes or regulations or in connection with tort claims, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has recognized that we are not responsible for the existing contamination. Amcor agreed to indemnify us for liabilities related to prior contamination at the Milwaukee facility, but we and Amcor may not agree on the scope of such indemnification. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business — We may be subject to losses due to liabilities or lawsuits related to contaminated land at our current or former facilities or arising out of environmental damage or personal injuries associated with exposure to hazardous substances or the release of hazardous substances.” -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will provide by its terms that it will automatically and unconditionally be released and terminate upon: (1) any sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, amalgamation or merger) of ----- the Capital Stock of such Guarantor after which such Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor, to a Person other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, if such sale or other disposition is permitted by the Indenture; (2) the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or the occurrence of any event after which the Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary; (3) defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in “— Defeasance” and “— Satisfaction and Discharge”; (4) such Guarantor being released from all of its obligations under all of its Guarantees of (i) payment by the Issuer of any Indebtedness of the Issuer under the Term Loan Credit Agreement or (ii) in the case of a Note Guarantee made by a Guarantor (each, an “Other _Guarantee”) as a result of its Guarantee of other Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor_ pursuant to the covenant entitled “— Certain Covenants — Limitation on Guarantees”, the relevant Indebtedness, except in the case of (i) or (ii), a release as a result of the repayment in full of the Indebtedness specified in clause (i) or (ii) (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement is still considered a release, and if any such Indebtedness of such Guarantor under the Term Loan Credit Agreement or any other Guarantee is so reinstated, such Note Guarantee shall also be reinstated); or (5) (i) the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of any Subsidiary Guarantor with and into the Issuer or another Subsidiary Guarantor that is the surviving Person in such merger, amalgamation or consolidation, or (ii) the liquidation or dissolution of such Subsidiary Guarantor following the transfer of all or substantially all of its assets to the Issuer or another Subsidiary Guarantor. Claims of creditors of Non-Guarantors, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Non-Guarantors, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those Non-Guarantors and claims against joint ventures generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Non-Guarantors and joint ventures over the claims of creditors of the Issuer, including Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be effectively subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Non-Guarantors and joint ventures. Although the Indenture will limit the incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation will be subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture.

Neither the Trustee nor the applicable registrar shall be liable for any selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph (including the procedures of the relevant depositaries). No Notes of $2,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least 10 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is (a) issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture or (b) subject to one or more conditions precedent and such redemption date is delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole discretion), as described above. The Issuer may provide in any redemption or purchase notice that payment of the redemption or purchase price and the performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption or purchase may be performed by another Person.

376_2,Offerings 2023.md,124,DESCRIPTION OF NOTES,124.10,Change of Control,124.10.1,,"The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs after the Issue Date, subject to the exceptions described below, the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase, subject to the right of Holders of the Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date occurring on or prior to the repurchase date. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register as provided under “— Selection and Notice”, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, subject to extension (in the case where such notice is mailed or otherwise delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control) in the event that the occurrence of the Change of Control is delayed, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-l under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall be deemed not to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders of the Notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The Credit Agreements provide, and we expect that future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer becomes a party may provide, that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder and that the Credit Agreements and future credit agreements or other agreements may prohibit or limit the Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers and us. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control after the Issue Date, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness, including Secured Indebtedness, are contained in the covenants described under “— Certain Covenants — Limitation on Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and ----- “— Certain Covenants — Limitation on Liens”. Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption “— Optional Redemption”, unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. For avoidance of doubt, a Special Redemption with respect to less than all of the outstanding Notes issued under the Indenture following a Change of Control will not relieve the Issuer from the obligation to make a Change of Control Offer for the remaining outstanding Notes. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

Additionally, upon the occurrence of an event resulting in Suspended Covenants, the amount of Excess Proceeds from Net Available Cash shall be reset to zero. If on any date following a Suspension Date the Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status (any such date, a “Reversion Date”), then the Suspended Covenants will thereafter be reinstated and be applicable pursuant to the terms of the Indenture (including in connection with performing any calculation or assessment to determine compliance with the terms of the Indenture), unless and until the Notes subsequently attain Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event of Default is in existence (in which event the Suspended Covenants shall no longer be in effect for such time that the Notes maintain an Investment Grade Status); provided, however, that no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on, and none of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for, any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period (as defined below), or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising prior to the applicable Reversion Date, regardless of whether such actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in effect during such period. The period of time between a Suspension Date and a Reversion Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period”. On any Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the applicable Suspension Period will be classified to have been Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of “— Limitation on Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” or one of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of “— Limitation on Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be Incurred thereunder as of such Reversion Date and after giving effect to the Indebtedness Incurred prior to such Suspension Period and outstanding on such Reversion Date). To the extent such Indebtedness would not be so permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the first and second paragraphs of “— Limitation on Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”, such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of “— Limitation on Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”. Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under “— Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be made as though the covenants described under “— Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect since the Issue Date prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period; provided, that no Subsidiaries may be designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period, unless such designation would have complied with the covenant described under “— Limitation on Restricted Payments” as if such covenant would have been in effect during such period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the covenant described under “— Limitation on Restricted Payments”. Any Affiliate Transaction entered into on and after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “— Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”. Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any NonGuarantor to take any action described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “— Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (1)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “— Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” on and after any Reversion Date. During the Suspension Period, any future obligation to grant further Note Guarantees shall be suspended. All such further obligation to grant Note Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date, but no Subsidiary of the Issuer shall be required to comply with the covenant described under “— Limitation on Guarantees” after the end of a Suspension Period with respect to any guarantee entered into by such Subsidiary during any Suspension Period.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “Limitation on Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”, the Issuer shall be in default of this covenant). For any purpose under the Indenture (including for purposes of determining compliance with any restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock), the U.S. Dollarequivalent principal amount or liquidation preference, as applicable, of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock was Incurred; provided, however, that in the case of revolving credit debt, the date such Indebtedness was first committed or first incurred (whichever yields the lower U.S. Dollar equivalent) shall be used; provided, further, however, that if such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as applicable, denominated in a foreign currency that is the same currency as that of the refinancing Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, (a) then the Issuer may elect to calculate the U.S. Dollar-equivalent principal amount or liquidation preference, as applicable, of such refinancing Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock based on the currency exchange rate in effect on the date such refinanced Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock was Incurred or first committed or first incurred (whichever yields the lower U.S. Dollar equivalent) in the case of revolving credit debt, and (b) if such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. Dollar denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. Dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount or liquidation preference, as applicable, of such refinancing Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not exceed (x) the principal amount or liquidation preference, as applicable, of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as applicable, being refinanced (plus unused commitments thereunder) plus (y) accrued interest, fees, defeasance costs and premium (including call and tender premiums), if any, under the refinanced Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock plus (z) underwriting discounts, fees, commissions and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees and similar items) in connection with the refinancing of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and the Incurrence of such new Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock. The principal amount or liquidation preference, as applicable, of any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as applicable, being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing (provided that, if such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. Dollar denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. Dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount or liquidation preference, as applicable, of such refinancing Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not exceed (x) the principal amount or liquidation preference, as applicable, of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as applicable, being refinanced (plus unused commitments thereunder) plus (y) accrued interest, fees, defeasance costs and premium (including call and tender premiums), if any, under the refinanced ----- Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock plus (z) underwriting discounts, fees, commissions and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees and similar items) in connection with the refinancing of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and the Incurrence of such new Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock). The Issuer shall determine any applicable currency exchange rate in good faith, and any such determination shall be conclusive for purposes of the Indenture. The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that is subordinated or junior in right of payment to any Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such Indebtedness is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee to the extent and in the same manner as such Indebtedness is subordinated to other Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be. The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or is secured by different collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer or Advance Offer, as applicable, by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness provided that no Notes or other Pari Passu Indebtedness in an unauthorized denomination will remain outstanding after such purchase. Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer or Advance Offer, as applicable, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion), but in the case of any Advance Offer, only with respect to the Advance Portion of any Excess Proceeds from the relevant Asset Disposition. To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency other than Dollars, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in Dollars that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into Dollars. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Foreign Subsidiary (a “Foreign Disposition”) is (x) prohibited or delayed by applicable local law, (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents or any agreement or (z) subject to other onerous organizational or administrative impediments from being repatriated to the United States, an amount equal to the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amount may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary so long, but only so long, as the applicable local law, organizational document, agreement or other impediment will not permit repatriation to the Issuer or a Guarantor (the Issuer hereby agreeing to use commercially reasonable efforts (as determined in the Issuer’s reasonable business judgment) to otherwise cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary to within 180 days following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required, promptly take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law, the applicable organizational document or agreement or the other applicable impediment to permit such repatriation to the Issuer or a Guarantor), and if within 180 days following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required, such repatriation of any of such affected Net Available Cash is permitted under the applicable local law, the applicable organizational document or agreement or the applicable other impediment, an amount equal to such amount of Net Available Cash so permitted to be repatriated will be promptly (and in any event not later than 20 Business Days after such repatriation is permitted) applied (net of any Taxes, costs or expenses that would be payable or reserved against if such amounts were actually repatriated whether or not they are repatriated) in compliance with this covenant and (ii) to the extent that the Issuer has determined in good faith that repatriation of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Foreign Disposition could have a material adverse tax consequence with respect to such Net Available Cash (which for the avoidance of doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any prepayment whereby doing so Holdings, the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates and/or equity partners would incur a tax liability, including a tax dividend, deemed dividend pursuant to Code Section 956 or a withholding tax), an amount equal to the portion of such Net Available Cash affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and the Net Available Cash so affected may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary. The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default. For the avoidance of doubt, so long as an amount equal to the amount of Net Available ----- Cash required to be applied in accordance with this covenant is applied by the Issuer, nothing in the Indenture shall be construed to require any Subsidiary to repatriate cash. For purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash: (1) the (x) assumption or (y) cancellation, extinguishment or termination of Indebtedness or other liabilities (as reflected on the Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto, or if incurred or accrued subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected on the Issuer’s consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence or accrual had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined in good faith by the Issuer) contingent or otherwise, in each case of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) and, in the case of clause (x) only, the release of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition; (2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition; (3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; (4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; and (5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of $60.0 million and 14% of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended Test Period (calculated on a Pro Forma Basis) (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value). The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-l under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. The Credit Agreements may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, any Specified Transaction that has been made by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries during the applicable Test Period or subsequent to the end of such Test Period and prior to or simultaneously with the Ratio Calculation Date shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all Specified Transactions (and the change in any associated interest coverage obligations, change in Consolidated EBITDA and the component financial definitions used therein or change in Total Assets, as applicable, attributable to any Specified Transaction) had occurred on the first day of such Test Period.

For purposes of this definition and the definitions of “Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio” and “Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio”, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a Specified Transaction, the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or chief ----- accounting officer of the Issuer and may include, for the avoidance of doubt, the amount of “run-rate” cost savings, operating expense reductions, synergies and changes in revenue resulting from or relating to such Specified Transaction projected by the Issuer in good faith to be realized as a result of actions taken or with respect to which substantial steps have been taken or are expected to be taken (calculated on a pro forma basis as though such cost savings, operating expense reductions, synergies and changes in revenue had been realized on the first day of such period and as if such cost savings, operating expense reductions, synergies and changes in revenue were realized during the entirety of such period and such that “run-rate” means the full recurring benefit for a period that is associated with any action taken, for which substantial steps have been taken or are expected to be taken (including any savings expected to result from the elimination of a public target’s compliance costs with public company requirements) net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such period from such actions), and any such adjustments shall be included in the initial pro forma calculations of such financial ratios or tests relating to such Specified Transaction (and in respect of any subsequent pro forma calculations in which such Specified Transaction is given pro forma effect) and during any applicable subsequent Test Period for any subsequent calculation of such financial ratios and tests; provided that (A) such amounts are reasonably identifiable and factually supportable in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, (B) such actions are taken or substantial steps with respect to such actions are or are expected to be taken no later than 24 months after the date of such Specified Transaction, and (C) no amounts shall be added to the extent duplicative of any amounts that are otherwise added back in computing Consolidated EBITDA (or any other components thereof), whether through a pro forma adjustment or otherwise, with respect to such period. If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire applicable Test Period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer to be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuer may designate. _“Consolidated Depreciation and Amortization Expense” means, with respect to any Person for any_ period, the total amount of depreciation and amortization expense, including the amortization of deferred financing fees or costs, debt issuance costs, commissions, fees, and expenses, capitalized expenditures (including Capitalized Software Expenditures), expenditures relating to software, license and intellectual property payments, any lease related assets recorded in purchase accounting, customer acquisition costs, original issue discount resulting from the issuance of Indebtedness at less than par and incentive payments, conversion costs, and contract acquisition costs of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries for such period on a consolidated basis and otherwise determined in accordance with GAAP. _“Consolidated EBITDA” means, with respect to any Person for any period, the Consolidated Net_ Income of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries for such period: (1) increased by (without duplication): (a) taxes paid and any provision for property taxes and for taxes based on income or profits or capital (including pursuant to any tax sharing arrangements), including U.S. federal, state, non-U.S., franchise, excise, value added and similar taxes and foreign withholding taxes and foreign unreimbursed value added taxes of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries paid or accrued during such period, including any penalties and interest related to such taxes or arising from any tax examinations, deducted (and not added back) in computing Consolidated Net Income;

provided that such cost savings, operating expense reductions, synergies (including product margin, product cost and revenue synergies) and changes in revenue in the good faith judgment of the Issuer are reasonably identifiable and factually supportable and it is understood and agreed that “run-rate” means the full recurring benefit for a period that is associated with any action either taken or with respect to which substantial steps have been taken or are expected to be taken within 24 months of the determination to take such action; plus (j) (i) the amount of loss or discount on sale of (x) Receivables Assets and related assets in connection with a Receivables Facility and (y) Securitization Assets and related assets in ----- connection with a Qualified Securitization Financing and (ii) charges or expenses incurred in connection with any other factoring or similar arrangement;

plus (m) with respect to any joint venture that is not a Restricted Subsidiary, an amount equal to the proportion of those items described in clauses (a), (b) and (c) above relating to such joint venture corresponding to the Issuer’s and the Restricted Subsidiaries’ proportionate share of such joint venture’s Consolidated Net Income (determined as if such joint venture were a Restricted Subsidiary);

and ----- (2) decreased by (without duplication): (a) non-cash gains increasing Consolidated Net Income of such Person for such period, excluding any non-cash gains which represent the reversal of any accrual of, or cash reserve for, anticipated cash charges that reduced Consolidated EBITDA in any prior period; provided that, to the extent non-cash gains are deducted pursuant to this clause (2)(a) for any previous period and not otherwise added back to Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA shall be increased by the amount of any cash receipts (or any netting arrangements resulting in reduced cash expenses) in respect of such non-cash gains received in subsequent periods to the extent not already included therein;

These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. We understand that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between the Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants. ----- The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other indirect participants such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants. We also understand that, pursuant to procedures established by DTC: (1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of the Participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and (2) ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interest in the Global Notes). Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants may hold their interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) which are Participants. Investors in the Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in such systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Restricted Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of Euroclear, and Citibank, N.A., as operator of Clearstream. All interests in a Global Note, including those held through Euroclear or Clearstream, may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of the Participants, which in turn act on behalf of the Indirect Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

Under the terms of the indenture, we and the Trustee will treat the persons in whose names the notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of the notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither we nor any agent of ours nor the Trustee nor its agents will have any responsibility or liability for: (1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interest in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes; or (2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants. ----- We understand that DTC’s current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe that it will not receive payment on such payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or us. Neither we nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of the Participants or the Indirect Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the notes, and we and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes. Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions”, transfers between the Participants will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, crossmarket transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by their respective depositaries; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream. We understand that DTC will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which such Participant or Participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute such notes to its Participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or to continue to perform such procedures, and may discontinue such procedures at any time.

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between the Regulation S Global Notes and the Rule 144A Global Notes will be effected by DTC by means of an instruction originated by the Trustee through the DTC Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note or vice versa, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest.

These potential payments may implicate the provisions of U.S. Treasury regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments”. Although the matter is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility that the foregoing payments will be made is remote and/or the payments, in the aggregate, are incidental or that the Notes are otherwise not subject to these rules and therefore the Notes are not subject to the rules governing contingent payment debt instruments. Our position is binding on a holder unless such holder discloses its contrary position in the manner required by applicable U.S. Treasury regulations. Our position is not, however, binding on the IRS and if the IRS were to successfully challenge this position, a holder might be required to accrue ordinary interest income on the notes in an amount greater than, and with timing different from the timing described herein with respect to, the stated interest and to treat as ordinary interest income (rather than capital gain) any gain realized on a taxable disposition of a note.

376_2,Offerings 2023.md,327,CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS,327.2,Taxation of U.S. Holders,327.2.2,Original Issue Discount,"The Notes will be treated as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. An obligation generally is treated as having been issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes if its “stated redemption price at maturity” exceeds its issue price by at least the statutorily defined “OID de minimis amount”. The OID de minimis amount generally equals 1/4 of 1% of the debt instrument’s stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of complete years from its issue date to its maturity. The “stated redemption price at maturity” of a Note is the sum of all principal and interest payments required to be made on such Note other than qualified stated interest payments. The amount of OID on a Note generally will be equal to the excess of the stated principal amount of such Note over its “issue price” (as defined above). A U.S. Holder will generally be required to include such OID in gross income as ordinary income for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the OID accrues, on a constant yield basis, in advance of the receipt of cash payments to which such income is attributable. A U.S. Holder must include in income in each taxable year the sum of the daily portions of OID for each day on which it held the Note during the taxable year. To determine the daily portions of OID, the amount of OID allocable to an accrual period is determined, and a ratable portion of such OID is allocated to each day in the accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to an accrual period will equal the product of the Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of the accrual period and the Note’s “yield to maturity” (adjusted to reflect the length of the accrual period), less the amount of any stated interest allocable to the accrual period. A Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of any accrual period generally will be its issue price, increased by the amount of OID, if any, allocable to all prior accrual periods and decreased by payments previously made on the Note other than stated interest. A Note’s yield to maturity is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value (as of the issue date) of all principal and interest payments to be made on the Note, produces an amount equal to the Note’s issue price. An accrual period may be of any length, and the length of the accrual periods may vary over the life of the Note, provided that no accrual period may be longer than one year. Each scheduled payment of stated interest or principal on the Note must occur on either the first day or last day of an accrual period. Under these rules, a U.S. holder generally will have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual periods. OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the amount payable at maturity (other than a payment of qualified stated interest) and the “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of the final accrual period. Under the Treasury Regulations, a holder of a Note with OID may elect to include in gross income all interest that accrues on the Note using the constant yield method. Once made with respect to the Note, the election cannot be revoked without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. holder considering an election under these rules should consult its own tax advisor. The rules regarding OID are complex. U.S. holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules to their particular situations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

Any such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss and generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the note has been held for more than one year by the U.S. Holder at the time of the disposition.

For example, if a Non-U.S. Holder qualifies for the benefits of an applicable income tax treaty, such treaty may reduce or eliminate such tax, in which event a Non-U.S. Holder claiming the benefit of such treaty must provide the withholding agent with a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or a suitable substitute or successor form) establishing the benefit of the applicable tax treaty.

It requires that a fiduciary discharge its duties with respect to such a Covered Plan (i) solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of such Covered Plan, (ii) for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the Covered Plan, (iii) in accordance with a prudence rule (that is “with the care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims”), (iv) by diversifying the investments of the Covered Plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses, unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so, and (v) in accordance with the documents governing the Covered Plan insofar as they are consistent with ERISA. In considering an investment of a portion of the assets of any Plan in the notes, a fiduciary should determine, among other things, whether the acquisition and holding of the notes is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws relating to the fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code, the role that the investment plays in the Plan’s portfolio, taking into consideration whether the investment is designed reasonably to further the Plan’s purposes, an examination of the risk and return factors, the portfolio’s composition with regard to diversification, the liquidity and current return of the total portfolio relative to the anticipated cash flow needs of the Plan, and the projected return of the total portfolio relative to the Plan’s funding objectives. Similar duties and restrictions may apply to fiduciaries of plans that are not subject to ERISA, such as governmental plans, church plans and non-U.S. plans. Fiduciaries of Plans subject to Similar Laws should consider their fiduciary duties under such Similar Laws in determining whether to invest in the notes offered hereby. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,352
376_2,Offerings 2023.md,125,CERTAIN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN CONSIDERATIONS,125.2,Prohibited Transaction Issues,125.2.1,,"Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Covered Plans from engaging in specified transactions involving assets of a Covered Plan with persons or entities who are, respectively, “parties in interest” within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified persons” within the meaning of Section 4975(e) of the Code, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction (including, without limitation, the lending of money or the extension of credit by the Covered Plan) may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. For example, a Covered Plan holding a note would be viewed by the U.S. Department of Labor as a continuing extension of credit by the Covered Plan to the Issuer. In addition, a fiduciary of a Covered Plan that engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code, including an obligation to correct the transaction. Accordingly, each original or subsequent purchaser or transferee of a note that is or may become a Covered Plan is responsible for determining the extent, if any, to which the purchase and holding of a note will constitute a prohibited transaction under ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code. The acquisition, holding, and/or disposition of the notes by a Covered Plan with respect to which we, any of our affiliates, the Trustee or any of its respective affiliates or any initial purchaser is or becomes considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the notes are acquired and are held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules could be applicable to the purchase and holding of notes by a Covered Plan, depending on the type and circumstances of the fiduciary making the decision to acquire such notes and the relationship of the party in interest or disqualified person to the Covered Plan. Included among these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code for certain transactions between a Covered Plan and non-fiduciary service providers to the Covered Plan. In addition, the United States Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the notes. These class exemptions (as may be amended from time to time) include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 (respecting transactions effected by independent “qualified professional asset managers”), PTCE 90-1 (respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 91-38 (respecting bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60 (respecting life insurance company general accounts) and PTCE 96-23 (respecting transactions directed by in-house asset managers). Each of these PTCEs contains conditions and limitations on its application. Thus, the fiduciaries of a Covered Plan that is considering acquiring and/or holding the notes in reliance of any of these, or any other, PTCEs should carefully review the conditions and limitations of the PTCE and consult with their counsel to confirm that it is applicable. There can be no, and we do not provide any, assurance that any PTCE or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the notes. Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any Plan unless such purchase, holding and, if applicable, disposition will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code or a violation of any applicable Similar Laws. The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that Plan fiduciaries, or other persons considering acquiring the notes (and holding the notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel, prior to any such acquisition, regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the acquisition and holding of the notes. Nothing herein shall be construed as a representation that an investment in the notes would meet any or all of the relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by, or is appropriate for, a Plan. ----- Purchasers of the notes have the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their acquisition, holding, and disposition of the notes complies with their fiduciary duties set forth in ERISA, the Code and any applicable Similar Laws and does not violate the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA or the Code or provisions under any applicable Similar Laws.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

The initial offering price is set forth on the cover page of this offering circular. After the notes are released for sale, the initial purchasers may change the offering prices and other selling terms. The offering of the notes by the initial purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the initial purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole or in part. The initial purchasers may offer and sell the notes through certain of their respective affiliates. The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act. Each initial purchaser has agreed that it will only offer or sell the notes (A) to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, (B) to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. In addition, each initial purchaser has agreed that it will only offer and sell the notes in Canada to purchasers that have represented, or been deemed to have represented, that they qualify as “accredited investor” as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions of the Canadian Securities Administrators. Terms used above have the meanings given to them by Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions”. In connection with sales outside the United States, the initial purchasers have agreed that they will not offer, sell or deliver the notes to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (i) as part of the initial purchasers’ distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering or the date the notes are originally issued. The initial purchasers will send to each dealer to whom they sell such notes during such 40-day period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. In addition, with respect to notes initially sold pursuant to Regulation S, until 40 days after the later of the commencement of this offering or the date the notes are originally issued, an offer or sale of such notes within the United States by a dealer that is not participating in the offering may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act. We have agreed in the purchase agreement, subject to certain exceptions, that for a period of 90 days after the closing date of the offering of the notes, neither we, nor any of our subsidiaries or other affiliates over which we exercise management or voting control, nor any person acting on our behalf will, without the prior written consent of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any securities that are substantially similar to the notes. The notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. Neither we nor the Issuer intend to list the notes on any national securities exchange. We cannot assure you that the prices at which the notes will sell in the market after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading market for the notes will develop and continue after this offering. We have been advised by certain of the initial purchasers that the initial purchasers intend to make a market in the notes, but they are not obligated to do so and may discontinue market making at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the notes. If an ----- active trading market for the notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the notes may be adversely affected. If the notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors. In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the initial purchasers of a greater number of notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes while the offering is in progress. The initial purchasers also may impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular initial purchaser repays to the initial purchasers a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC or its affiliates has repurchased notes sold by or for the account of such initial purchasers in stabilizing or short-covering transactions. These activities by the initial purchasers, as well as other purchases by the initial purchasers for their own accounts, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued by the initial purchasers at any time. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes. The initial purchasers are full-service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Specifically, affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers act as arrangers, agents and lenders under our New Term Loan Facility, and may enter into certain hedging transactions with us that are secured under our New Term Loan Facility. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates have in the past performed commercial banking, investment banking and advisory services for us from time to time for which they have received customary fees and reimbursement of expenses and may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform services for us in the ordinary course of their business for which they may receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (which may include bank loans and/or credit default swaps) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers and may at any time hold long and short positions in such securities and instruments. Such investment and securities activities may involve our securities and instruments and those of our affiliates. In addition, affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers are acting as arrangers, agents and lenders under our ABL Facility and New Term Loan Facility, and may receive certain of the proceeds used by the Company to refinance the ABL Facility and New Term Loan Facility. An affiliate of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC is the administrative agent, collateral agent and a lender under the New Term Loan Facility. An affiliate of BMO Capital Markets Corp. is the administrative agent, collateral agent and a joint lead arranger and bookrunner under the ABL Facility. If the initial purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, they routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby. The initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. ----- We have agreed to indemnify the several initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to make because of any of those liabilities.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

COVID-19** The Company is continually responding to changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Necessary protocols to address the safety of our employees and preserve the continuity of our operations have been implemented and are continually monitored and addressed. We believe we currently possess sufficient liquidity to meet ongoing needs and continue to operate as an “essential supplier” across substantially all of our product lines and locations worldwide. We have operated globally without significant, extended disruption to demand or production due to COVID-19 as of the date of this filing. In a few instances, the Company has had to interrupt or adjust production for short periods to follow established protocols where the potential for exposure had been identified, or in response to non-US government actions, until such time as our status as an “essential supplier” could be established. To date, the Company has not experienced any significant negative impacts resulting from non-attendance of our employees. As the COVID- 19 pandemic evolves, the Company will continue to adapt operations to service ongoing customer needs. The extent of the impact of the COVID- 19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, severity and spread of the pandemic, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, and impacts to the businesses of our customers, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

If, after completing the qualitative assessment or the Company elects to skip the qualitative assessment, or the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company proceeds to a quantitative impairment test. The Company did not record a goodwill impairment charge for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 or June 30, 2020. Intangible assets may be subject to impairment charges.

Estimated useful lives are determined considering the period in which the assets are expected to contribute to future cash flows and generally range from seven to twenty years. Intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable over their estimated useful life. When a triggering event for impairment is identified, the Company compares the carrying value of the relevant assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. When the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than their carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. To determine fair value, the Company principally uses internal discounted cash flow estimates, but also uses quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value at the valuation date. Cash flow estimates are derived from historical experience and internal business plans with an appropriate discount rate applied. The Company evaluates the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates, which the Company expects will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. While management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities, which could be material. The Company is also required to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets. The Company evaluates all positive and negative evidence and uses judgments regarding past and future events, including operating results and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, the Company determines when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of its deferred tax assets may not be realized, in which case the Company records a valuation allowance to offset its deferred tax assets in an amount equal to future tax benefits that may not be realized. To the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. The Company establishes additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the Company is examined by various Federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of the provision for income taxes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with the classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of operations. Currently, leases are classified as either capital or operating, with only capital leases recognized on the balance sheet. The reporting of lease-related expenses in the statements of operations and cash flows will be generally consistent with the current guidance.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2021 (Dollar amounts in thousands, except share data)",2959.5.16,,"Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment. The more significant judgments and assumptions made to determine the fair value of the Company’s reporting units were (1) the amount and timing of expected future cash flows which are based primarily on the Company’s estimates of future sales, earnings, taxes and investments, (2) the expected long-term growth rates for each of the Company’s reporting units, (3) discount rates that are used to discount future cash flows to their present values, and (4) determination of appropriate earnings multiples used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value under the market approach and the selection of appropriate comparable companies for each reporting unit to be used for purposes of determining those multiples. In-process research and development (“IPRD”) that has not reached commercialization is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate a potential reduction in the fair values of the assets below their carrying value. If the carrying value of IPRD is determined to exceed the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. At June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, the Company had no material intangible assets with indefinite lives other than goodwill and in-process research and development. Company records the total rent payable during the lease term on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and records the difference between the rents paid and the straight-line rent as a deferred rent. Any lease incentives the Company receives for items such as leasehold improvements are recorded as a deferred credit for the amount of the lease incentive and amortized over the lease term, which may or may not equal the amortization period of the leasehold improvements. and other volume- based incentives. Revisions to these estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. The Company offers certain sales incentives to customers who become eligible based on the level of purchases made during the calendar year. The sales incentives programs are considered customer volume rebates, which are typically computed as a percentage of customer sales, and in certain instances, the rebate percentage may increase as customers achieve sales hurdles. Volume rebates are accrued throughout the year based on the Company’s estimates of customers’ annual and quarterly sales volumes and the expected annual rebate percentage achieved. The Company characterizes the volume rebates to customers as a reduction of revenue in its consolidated statements of operations. With respect to environmental contamination, the Company operates within the requirements of numerous regulations at the local, state, U.S. Federal and foreign levels regarding issues such as the handling and disposal of hazardous chemicals, waste-water treatment and effluent and emissions limitations, among others. From a practical standpoint, certain environmental contamination cannot be reasonably determined until a facility or asset is retired or an event occurs that otherwise requires the facility to be tested and monitored. In the absence of such requirements to test for environmental contamination prior to an asset or facility retirement, the Company anticipates operating its manufacturing facilities indefinitely into the future thereby rendering the potential range of settlement dates as indeterminate.

The ASU removed the disclosure requirements of, among other things, the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as part of net periodic benefit cost over the next year and information about plan assets to be returned to the entity including amounts and expected timing.

The acquisition expands the Company’s product offerings. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method. Under the acquisition method of accounting, assets acquired and liabilities assumed from these operations are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition. This allocation is based on a preliminary fair value of assets acquired and is expected to change during the measurement period. The preliminary goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition of the assets is primarily attributable to the synergies expected with the expansion of the Company’s product offerings. The preliminary purchase price, net of cash acquired, was approximately $165.0. A portion of the transaction consideration for the acquisition of Ematec took the form of a $27.0 deferred payment promissory note in favor of the seller payable by Intermediate.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2022 (Dollar amounts in millions, except share data)",2964.1.1,,"The Company has commitments under operating leases for certain manufacturing and warehouse facilities, machinery and equipment, as well other facilities used in its operations. The Company has finance leases which are included in long-term debt. Excluding short-term leases and any corresponding extension options, the Company’s leases have remaining non-cancellable terms of up to approximately 17 years. Some of the Company’s leases include options to extend or renew, and some of which include options to terminate the leases with notice periods of up to 1 year. Certain lease agreements contain provisions for future rent increases. Payments due under lease contracts are fixed. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at contract inception. A lease exists when a contract conveys to the customer the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The definition of a lease embodies two conditions: (1) there is an identified asset in the contract that is land or a depreciable asset (i.e., property, plant, and equipment), and (2) the customer has the right to control the use of the identified asset. The Company determines whether the contracts are considered an operating or finance lease. Operating leases are included in right-of-use (“ROU”) lease assets, current portion lease liability, and lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet when the lease term exceeds one year. The lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date. Key estimates and judgments include how the Company determined (1) the discount rate it uses to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value, (2) lease term and (3) lease payments. (1) ASC 842 requires a lessee to discount its unpaid lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, its incremental borrowing rate. As the majority of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses the private company practical expedient which allows for utilizing the risk-free rate to discount the future cash flows. (2) The lease term for all of the Company’s leases includes the non-cancellable period of the lease plus any additional periods covered by a Company option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. (3) Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following: fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives paid or payable to the lessee, variable payments that depend on an index or rate, amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee and the exercise price of the Company option to purchase the underlying asset if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. The ROU asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received. For operating leases, the ROU asset is subsequently measured throughout the lease term at the amount of the remeasured lease liability, adjusted for the remaining balance of any lease incentives received, any cumulative prepaid or accrued rent if the lease payments are uneven throughout the lease term and any unamortized initial direct costs. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments associated with the Company’s leases are recognized when the event, activity, or circumstance in the lease agreement on which those payments are assessed occurs. Variable lease payments are presented as operating expenses in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations in the same line item as expense arising from fixed lease payments for operating leases. ----- ROU assets for operating leases are subject to the long-lived assets impairment guidance in ASC Subtopic 360-10, Property, Plant, and Equipment. The Company monitors for events or changes in circumstances that require a reassessment of a lease. When a reassessment results in the remeasurement of a lease liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the corresponding ROU asset unless doing so would reduce the carrying amount of the ROU asset to an amount less than zero. In that case, the amount of the adjustment that would result in a negative ROU asset balance is recorded in profit or loss. The Company has lease agreements which include lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for separately using a relative stand-alone price basis. The Company recognized rent expense for the six months ended December 31, 2021 of $10.6, and the Company recorded $0.3 of sublease rental income.

LEASES,2964.4,,2964.4.1,,"On July 1, 2022 the Company adopted ASC Topic 842, Leases (“ASC 842”) using a modified retrospective transition method and elected the optional transition method as defined within Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-11. As a result, the Company was not required to adjust its comparative period financial information for effects of the standard or make the new required lease disclosures for periods before the date of adoption (i.e. July 1, 2022). The Company has elected to adopt the package of transition practical expedients and, therefore, has not reassessed (1) whether existing or expired contracts contain a lease, (2) lease classification for existing or expired leases or (3) the accounting for initial direct costs that were previously capitalized. The Company did not elect the practical expedient to use hindsight for leases existing at the adoption date. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for all short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less. The Company recognizes the lease payments associated with its short-term leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments associated with these leases are recognized and presented in the same manner as for all other Company leases. Additionally, the Company applies the private company practical expedient to the use the risk-free rate as the discount rate. As a result of the adoption of ASC 842 the Company recorded ROU assets of $100.4 and current and long-term lease liabilities of $12.1 and $88.3, respectively. Also, in connection with the adoption the Company re-evaluated a sale-leaseback lease and two build-to-suit leases under ASC 840, where the facilities were formerly treated as owned assets. The evaluation resulted in recording an increase to property, plant and equipment of $4.6, an increase to current liabilities of $2.0, a decrease to long-term liabilities of $7.3, and a resulting increase to retained earnings of $9.9. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with US GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the consolidated financial statements. In performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS, we: - Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. - Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.

The Company sells products primarily to large manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies. The Company performs continuing credit evaluations of customers’ financial condition, and although the Company generally does not require collateral, letters of credit or cash in advance may be required from customers in certain circumstances. Management reviews accounts receivable on a monthly basis to determine if any receivables will potentially be uncollectible. The Company includes any accounts receivable balances that are determined to be uncollectible in the overall allowance for doubtful accounts. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written-off against the allowance. Based on the information available, the Company believes the allowances for doubtful accounts as of June 30, 2022 and 2021 were adequate. However, actual write-offs could exceed the recorded allowance. The Company’s largest customer, in terms of Net sales, accounts for approximately 5.1% and 5.0% of total Net sales for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

In applying the goodwill impairment test, the Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for the Company’s products and services, regulatory and political developments, and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance. If, after completing the qualitative assessment or the Company elects to skip the qualitative assessment, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company proceeds to a quantitative impairment test. Intangible assets may be subject to impairment charges. Intangible assets acquired through acquisitions are initially measured at fair value and any changes in expectations used in the valuation of such intangible assets could potentially lead to an impairment. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment. The more significant judgments and assumptions made to determine the fair value of the Company’s reporting units were (1) the amount and timing of expected future cash flows which are based primarily on the Company’s estimates of future sales, earnings, taxes and investments, (2) the expected long-term growth rates for each of the Company’s reporting units, (3) discount rates that are used to discount future cash flows to their present values, and (4) determination of appropriate earnings multiples used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value under the market approach and the selection of appropriate comparable companies for each reporting unit to be used for purposes of determining those multiples. In-process research and development (“IPRD”) that has not reached commercialization is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate a potential reduction in the fair values of the assets below their carrying value. If the carrying value of IPRD is determined to exceed the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

Estimated useful lives are determined considering the period in which the assets are expected to contribute to future cash flows and generally range from seven to twenty years. Intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable over their estimated useful life. When a triggering event for impairment is identified, the Company compares the carrying value of the relevant assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. When the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than their carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. To determine fair value, the Company principally uses internal discounted cash flow estimates, but also uses quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value at the valuation date. Cash flow estimates are derived from historical experience and internal business plans with an appropriate discount rate applied. The Company evaluates the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

Furthermore, the Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. The Company also manufactures and sells equipment, in which case revenue is recognized over the life of the contract based on percentage of completion. Revenue is recorded net of estimated returns and allowances, customer incentive programs and other incentive offerings including special pricing agreements, promotions, discounted payment terms and other volume-based incentives. Revisions to these estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. The Company offers certain sales incentives to customers who become eligible based on the level of purchases made during the calendar year. The sales incentives programs are considered customer volume rebates, which are typically computed as a percentage of customer sales, and in certain instances, the rebate percentage may increase as customers achieve certain purchase levels.

The Company has a number of AROs that are conditional in nature including those triggered upon the Company’s commitments to take certain actions, including demolition, renovation and other retirementrelated activities. These actions include the preparation of certain properties for sale or for alternative uses as well as the requirement to dismantle the Company’s manufacturing facilities in certain countries upon their ultimate retirement. There are also conditional requirements for asset component retirements in which the Company can reasonably estimate both the amount of the required settlement as well as the range of settlement dates.

In the absence of such requirements to test for environmental contamination prior to an asset or facility retirement, the Company anticipates operating its manufacturing facilities indefinitely into the future thereby rendering the potential range of settlement dates as indeterminate.

The Company is also required to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets. The Company evaluates all positive and negative evidence and uses judgments regarding past and future events, including operating results and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, the Company determines when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of its deferred tax assets may not be realized, in which case the Company records a valuation allowance to offset its deferred tax assets in an amount equal to future tax benefits that may not be realized. To the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required.

The Company assesses the available positive and negative evidence surrounding the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and applies its judgment in estimating the amount of valuation allowance necessary under the circumstances, if any. The valuation allowance against U.S. Federal, foreign and state deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2022 and 2021 was $39.4 and $22.9 respectively. The valuation allowances relate primarily to state and foreign deferred tax assets. _U.S. Tax Reform_ On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to, reducing the top U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain un-repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries; generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; requiring a current inclusion in U.S. federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations (GILTI); eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized; creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT), a new minimum tax; the acceleration of expensing for certain business assets; creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense; and changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. In July 2021, the U.S. Treasury Department and IRS (collectively “Treasury”) released new regulations related to the tax reform provisions of GILTI and IRC Section 163(j) limitation on deductible interest expense. Upon retroactive adoption of the regulations, the Company recorded a federal tax benefit of $9.3 related to the June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2020 tax periods in June 30, 2021 as these regulations are considered changes in tax law occurring during June 30, 2021. _Provision Related to Foreign Sourced Earnings_ While the U.S. Tax Act provides for a participation exemption, for tax years beginning after January 1, 2018, it includes two new U.S. tax base erosion provisions, the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provisions and the base-erosion and anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”) provisions. Both provisions became effective for the Company during year end June 30, 2019 and continues to current year-end June 30, 2022. The GILTI provisions require the Company to include in its U.S. income tax return foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary’s tangible assets. The Company has made an accounting policy election to treat the taxes due on future US GILTI inclusions in taxable income as a current-period expense when incurred (“period cost method”); therefore, the Company has not recorded any deferred taxes related to GILTI. As result of adopting the aforementioned July 2021 Treasury regulations, the Company recorded zero GILTI tax expense related to foreign earnings during the period June 30, 2022.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

In the opinion of management, none of its current legal proceedings are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s business or financial results. The Company evaluates, on a regular basis, developments in its legal matters. The Company records a provision for a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. With respect to any current legal proceedings or claims pending against the Company for which it has not made an accrual, but for which it is reasonably possible that a loss may occur, the Company is unable to estimate a range of loss due to various reasons, including, among others: (1) that the proceedings are in early stages, (2) that there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals, motions, or settlements, (3) that there are significant factual issues to be resolved, and (4) that there are novel legal issues presented. Such legal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company’s control. Based on current knowledge, the Company believes that the final outcome of the matters discussed above will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. While the Company intends to vigorously defend these matters, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters, there exists the possibility of adverse outcomes, and the final outcome of a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. The Company is subject to environmental laws requiring the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination. In addition to remediation being undertaken by third parties at a limited number of its locations, the Company is investigating and remediating existing environmental conditions resulting from past industrial activity at several of the Company’s facilities, including several of the Company’s New Jersey facilities pursuant to the requirements of New Jersey’s Industrial Site Recovery Act (“ISRA”). If any other events were to occur in the future that would be deemed to have affected a “change of control” or shutdown of any of the Company’s New Jersey facilities as defined under ISRA, the Company would be required to take additional actions to comply with that statute, possibly resulting in additional investigations and remediation costs. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND FACTORING,2986.1,,2986.1.1,,"One of the Company’s indirect, wholly- owned Belgian subsidiaries maintains an agreement whereby certain trade receivables generated by the subsidiary are sold to a financial institution. The structure of these transactions provides for a legal “true sale” as defined by GAAP. The financial institution funds an initial purchase price of 90% of approved accounts receivable. The remaining deferred purchase price is settled upon collection of the receivables, less fees and expenses. At each consolidated balance sheet date, the Company removes from accounts receivable the amount of proceeds received from the initial purchase prices as they meet the applicable criteria and continues to recognize the deferred purchase price in the Company’s accounts receivable. The receivables are sold on a non- recourse basis. The maximum amount of aggregate receivables that may be sold under this agreement is €15,000 (approximately $17,800 at June 30, 2021). The Company has an agreement with a third party financial institution to outsource the collection and processing functions of certain non-U.S. accounts receivable for customers that have been pre-approved by the financial institution associated with the Company’s Northern Ireland operations. The Northern Ireland agreement allows the Company to seek advances of up to 85% of the receivables that have been accepted by the financial institution for collection and processing. The maximum allowable advances under the agreement is £2,000 (approximately $ 2,773 at June 30, 2021). Collections made by the financial institution are transferred to an account on a daily basis or when requested and the Company is charged an administrative fee as defined in the agreements. There were no advances under the Northern Ireland agreement as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively.

As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the deferred sale proceeds for this transaction totaled $20,062 and $19,792, respectively. Due to the Company’s continuing involvement with this facility related to this environmental remediation, the proceeds received have been deemed to be a financing transaction and were recognized as a deferred long-term liability. As of June 30, 2021, the net book value of the property of $15,382 is included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, certain operating costs, including depreciation, related to the ownership and operation of the facility subsequent to the transaction have been, and will continue to be, included in the Company’s results of operations until the remediation is complete as determined by the NJDEP. The Company is concurrently leasing back the facility with the lease term ending March 2031. Until the sale transaction is completed from an accounting perspective, lease payments will be applied to the liability and interest imputed at approximately 8.5% as the cash lease payments are made. The Company recognized interest expense of $1,691 and increased the liability by $270 during fiscal year 2021. The Company recognized interest expense of $1,672 and increased the liability by $223 during fiscal year 2020.

The valuation allowances relate primarily to state and foreign deferred tax assets. _U.S. Tax Reform_ On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) . The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to, reducing the top U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries; generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; requiring a current inclusion in U.S. federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations (GILTI); eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized; creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT), a new minimum tax; the acceleration of expensing for certain business assets; creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense; and changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. In July 2020, the U.S. Treasury Department and IRS (collectively “Treasury”) released new regulations related to the tax reform provisions of GILTI and IRC Section 163(j) limitation on deductible interest expense. Upon retroactive adoption of the regulations, the Company recorded a federal tax benefit of $9,274 related to the June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2020 tax periods in the current year as these regulations are considered changes in tax law occurring during June 30, 2021. _Provision Related to Foreign Sourced Earnings_ While the U.S. Tax Act provides for a participation exemption, for tax years beginning after January 1, 2018, it includes two new U.S. tax base erosion provisions, the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provisions and the base-erosion and anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”) provisions. Both provisions became effective for the Company during yearend June 30, 2019 and continues to current year-end June 30, 2021. The GILTI provisions require the Company to include in its U.S. income tax return foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary’s tangible assets. The Company has made an accounting policy election to treat the taxes due on future US GILTI inclusions in taxable income as a current-period expense when incurred (“period cost method”); therefore, the Company has not recorded any deferred taxes related to GILTI. As result of adopting the aforementioned July 2020 Treasury regulations, the Company recorded zero GILTI tax expense related to foreign earnings during the period June 30, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2023,352

The accumulated other comprehensive (income) loss (pre-tax) for the U.S. Pension Plan was ($1,841) and $2,830 as of as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively, which consists entirely of the actuarial (gain) loss. The assumptions used in the determination of the benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost (income) of the U.S. Pension Plan were as follows: June 30, 2021 June 30, 2020 Discount rate used in determination of benefit obligation . . . 2.40% 2.30% Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets . . . . . . . . 5.50% 6.00% Discount rate used in determination of net periodic pension cost . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.30% 3.30% The discount rate assumption used to determine the Company’s pension obligation reflects the expected future cash flow based on plan provisions and participant data as of the beginning of the plan year. The discount rate was based on a yield curve, which is determined by the plan’s actuary. The Company believes the yield curve provides a good match to the timing and amount of expected benefit payments. The expected long-term return on plan assets assumption was developed as a weighted average rate based on the target asset allocation of the plan and the long-term capital market assumptions. The overall return for each asset class was developed by combining a long-term inflation component and the associated expected real rates. The development of the capital market assumptions utilized a variety of methodologies, including, but not limited to, historical analysis, stock valuation models such as dividend discount models and earnings yields’ models, expected economic growth outlook, and market yields analysis. The U.S. Pension Plan’s asset allocations at June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, based on market values, and the target allocations for fiscal year 2021, are as follows: Target Actual Allocation Allocation Asset Class 2022 June 30, 2021 June 30, 2020 Equity securities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 60% 59% 59% Fixed income securities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40% 41% 41% 100% 100% 100% ----- The U.S. Pension Plan investments are held in trust and managed by a large financial institution (the “Trustee”) and are invested in accordance with investment policies and guidelines established by a Company Administrative Committee. The Company’s investment objective is to obtain a return commensurate with the level of assumed risk. U.S. Pension Plan assets are to be structured to achieve real, inflation-adjusted growth and are to be adequately diversified to provide a degree of stability in order to balance the long- term growth objectives with short-term liquidity requirements. Diversification among asset classes is used to control the variability of aggregate returns while investing in asset classes that may individually have volatile returns. The U.S. Pension Plan’s investments measured at fair value as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020 were as follows: June 30, 2021 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total Equity funds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 9,134 $ — $ — $ 9,134 Fixed income funds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9,693 — — 9,693 $18,827 $ — $ — $18,827 June 30, 2020 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total Equity funds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 7,954 $ — $ — $ 7,954 Fixed income funds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8,448 — — 8,448 $16,402 $ — $ — $16,402 - Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. - Level 2: Observable inputs other than those included in Level 1. For example, quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets in inactive markets. - Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset. As of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, the Company also has $8,060 and $7,018, respectively, of pension investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value (“NAV”) per share practical expedient, and are not included in the fair value hierarchy table included above.

Such legal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company’s control. Based on current knowledge, the Company believes that the final outcome of the matters discussed above will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. While the Company intends to vigorously defend these matters, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters, there exists the possibility of adverse outcomes, and the final outcome of a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. The Company is subject to environmental laws requiring the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination. In addition to remediation being undertaken by third parties at a limited number of its locations, the Company is investigating and remediating existing environmental conditions resulting from past industrial activity at several of the Company’s facilities, including several of the Company’s New Jersey facilities pursuant to the requirements of New Jersey’s Industrial Site Recovery Act (“ISRA”). If any other events were to occur in the future that would be deemed to have affected a “change of control” or shutdown of any of the Company’s New Jersey facilities as defined under ISRA, the Company would be required to take additional actions to comply with that statute, possibly resulting in additional investigations and remediation costs. _Self-Insured Claims_ The Company is primarily self-insured for its workers’ compensation claims and employee group health claims for the Company’s domestic operations, which the Company limits through stop-loss insurance coverage. The Company’s workers’ compensation claims are limited for individual claims in excess of $500 per occurrence, subject to annual adjustments based on loss experience. Additionally, the Company’s employee group health claims are limited for individual claims in excess of $225 per occurrence.
