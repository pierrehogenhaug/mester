The Issuer has not authorized the making or provision of any representation or information regarding the Exchange

**custodians or intermediaries may impose their own deadlines for instructions to be received from Eligible**
**Holders in the Existing Notes with respect to the Exchange Offers, which may be earlier than the Expiration**

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN INVESTORS**

**United States**

None of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, any state securities commission or any other regulatory
authority has approved or disapproved of the New Notes or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees (as defined
below), and none of the foregoing authorities have passed upon or endorsed the merits of the Exchange Offers or
the accuracy or adequacy of this Exchange Offer Memorandum. Any representation to the contrary could be a
criminal offense in certain jurisdictions.

The Issuer will not accept offers of Existing Notes for exchange with respect to book-entry interests held in the
Rule 144A Existing Notes. Each purchaser of the New Notes will be deemed to have made the representations,
warranties and acknowledgements that are described in this Exchange Offer Memorandum under “Issue and
_Resale Restrictions.” The New Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the_
securities laws of any state of the United States and are subject to certain restrictions on transfer. For a description
of certain further restrictions on resale or transfer of the New Notes, see “Issue and Resale Restrictions.”

**EEA**

The New Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a “retail investor” means a
person who is one (or more) of: (i) a “retail client” as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a
customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended or superseded, the “Insurance Distribution
_Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a “professional client” as defined in point (10) of Article_
4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as
amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the New Notes or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the New Notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or the United Kingdom may be unlawful under
the PRIIPs Regulation.

iii


-----

This Exchange Offer Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of New Notes in any Member
State of the EEA that is subject to the Prospectus Regulation (as defined below) (each, a “Relevant Member State”)
will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a
prospectus for offers of the New Notes. “Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 on the
prospectus to be published when the securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated
market.

of the Prospectus Regulation. Accordingly, this Exchange Offer Memorandum has not been and will not be
notified to, or approved by, the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority (Autoriteit voor Financiële
_Diensten en Markten/Autorité des Services et Marchés Financiers). This offer cannot be advertised and this_

_Securities Prospectus Act”), the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of June 14, 2017 (as amended, the “Prospectus_
_Regulation”) and any other laws applicable in Germany. This Exchange Offer Memorandum has not been and_
will not be submitted to, nor has it been nor will it be approved by, the German Federal Financial Supervisory
Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) (“BaFin”). BaFin has not obtained and will not obtain
a notification from another competent authority of a member state of the European Union (each a member state),
with which a securities prospectus may have been filed, pursuant to Article 25 of the Prospectus Regulation. The
New Notes must not be distributed within Germany by way of a public offer, public advertisement or in any
similar manner, and this Exchange Offer Memorandum and any other document relating to the New Notes, as
well as information contained therein, may not be supplied to the public in Germany or used in connection with
any offer for subscription of New Notes to the public in Germany. Consequently, in Germany the New Notes will
only be available to, and this Exchange Offer Memorandum and any other offering material in relation to the New

2 No. 3 of the German Securities Prospectus Act in connection with Article 2 lit. e of the Prospectus Regulation.

None of this Exchange Offer Memorandum or any other document or materials relating to the Exchange Offers
have been or will be submitted to the clearance procedures of the Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la

as an exempted offer pursuant to article 101-bis, paragraph 3-bis of the Legislative Decree No. 58 of February 24,
1998, as amended (the “Financial Services Act”) and article 35-bis, paragraph 4 of CONSOB Regulation No.
11971 of May 14, 1999, as amended. Noteholders that are resident and/or located in Italy can offer Existing Notes

**United Kingdom**

The New Notes described in this Exchange Offer Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise
made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United
Kingdom. For the purposes of this paragraph, a “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a
“retail client”, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic
law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended, the “EUWA”); (ii) a “customer” within
the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended, the “FSMA”) and any
rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer

as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (“UK MiFIR”); or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as
defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation, and the expression an offer includes the communication in
any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the New Notes to be offered so
as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the New Notes. Consequently, no key information
document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA
(as amended, the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the New Notes described in the

it operates, are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Exchange Offer Memorandum,

These risks and other described under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Exchange Offer Memorandum are not
exhaustive. Due to such uncertainties and risks, Noteholders or other potential investors are cautioned not to place
undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as at the date of this Exchange Offer
Memorandum. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events described in this
Exchange Offer Memorandum may not occur. Moreover, the Group operates in a very competitive and rapidly
changing environment. The Group may face new risks from time to time, and it is not possible for the Issuer to
predict all such risks; nor can the Issuer assess the impact of all such risks on the Group’s business or the extent
to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained
in any forward-looking statement. Given these risks and uncertainties, Noteholders should not place undue
reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results or performance.

Certain forward-looking statements are based on plans, estimates and projections as they are currently available
to management. Neither the Issuer nor the Group undertakes any obligation, and does not expect, to publicly
update or publicly revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise. Although the Issuer believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are
reasonable, neither the Issuer nor the Group gives any assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.
All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Issuer, the Group or to persons
acting on either of their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements referred to
above and contained elsewhere in this Exchange Offer Memorandum.

information regarding market sizes, market shares, market growth rates, market trends and competition in the
markets in which we operate, speak as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2021, as applicable.

We operate in the pharmaceuticals sector of the global healthcare industry. In certain cases, it is difficult in this
sector to obtain precise market, economic and industry information. Certain information used in this Exchange
Offer Memorandum has been obtained from IQVIA Holdings, Inc. (formerly, Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.)
(“IQVIA”), a leading information, services and technology company. In particular, information obtained from
IQVIA includes descriptions of the pharmaceutical markets in certain geographies and details of the Group’s
market share and competitive position, which may be based on manufacturer or pharmacy sales and volume or
value. In addition, certain information regarding industry benchmarks and potential cost savings have been
obtained by the Sponsors (as defined herein) from a leading global consulting firm.

None of the Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors or the Dealer Managers accepts responsibility for the
factual correctness of any such statistics or information obtained from third parties. While the Issuer believes this
information to be reliable, it has not been independently verified, and we do not make any representation or

warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of such information set forth in this Exchange Offer Memorandum.
Market data and statistics are inherently predictive and subject to uncertainty and not necessarily reflective of
actual market conditions. Such statistics are based on market research, which itself is based on sampling and
subjective judgments by both the researchers and the respondents, including judgments about what types of
products and transactions should be included in the relevant market. Additionally, industry publications and
reports from management consultants generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained
from sources believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed
and in some instances state that they do not assume liability for such information. We cannot therefore assure you
of the accuracy and completeness of such information as we have not independently verified such information.

**TRADEMARKS AND TRADE NAMES**

The Group owns or has rights to certain trademarks, trade names or service marks that it uses in connection with
the operation of its business. The Group asserts, to the fullest extent under applicable law, its rights to its
trademarks, trade names and service marks. Each trademark, trade name or service mark of any other company
appearing in this Exchange Offer Memorandum belongs to its holder.

proposed Exchange Offers are consistent with the Issuer’s strategy of extending average debt maturities of the
Group.

**Q:** **What consideration is the Issuer offering to Eligible Holders participating in the Exchange Offers?**

A: The Issuer is making an offer to Eligible Holders to exchange each validly offered for exchange (and not
validly withdrawn) €1,000 in principal amount of Existing Notes held by them for €1,000 of New Notes plus cash
consideration in an amount equal to €80. Eligible Holders will also be entitled to receive accrued and unpaid
interest in respect of such Existing Notes from, and including, the most recent interest payment in respect of such
Existing Notes to, but not including, the Settlement Date.

**Q:** **How do Eligible Holders benefit from participating in the Exchange Offers?**

A: The New Notes are expected to have a higher coupon than the Existing Notes, and by exchanging their
Existing Notes for New Notes, Eligible Holders will be able to participate in the combined tranche of New Notes,
which may be more liquid than the remaining tranches of Existing Notes, pending the outcome of the Exchange
Offers. None of the Dealer Managers is making any recommendation as to whether or not you should offer your
Existing Notes for exchange. You should make your own investigation and analysis of the creditworthiness of the
Issuer and your own determination of the suitability of such investment, with particular reference to your own
investment objectives and experience, and any other factors that may be relevant to you in connection with such
investment.

**Q:** **What will happen to my Existing Notes if I do not participate in the Exchange Offers?**

A: You are not required to offer your Existing Notes for exchange pursuant to the Exchange Offers. You
can opt to continue to hold your Existing Notes as per the terms applicable to them.

xi


-----

**Q:** **What is likely to happen if the Exchange Offers are not completed?**

A: The Existing Notes will continue to remain outstanding as per the terms applicable to them. The Issuer
will continue to assess its financing options and monitor the capital markets with a view to extending its average
debt maturities and proactively managing its debt profile.

**Q:** **May I offer for exchange only a portion of the Existing Notes that I hold?**

A: Yes. You may offer for exchange a portion of the Existing Notes held by you, subject to you offering for
exchange in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

**Q:** **Who is making the Exchange Offers?**

A: The Exchange Offers are made by the Issuer and the New Notes will be issued by the Issuer.

**Q:** **How do the New Notes differ from the Existing Notes?**

A: The terms of the New Notes are substantially similar to the terms of the Existing Notes. However, the
New Notes will have a different issue date, a higher interest rate, different interest payment dates, a longer maturity
date, different redemption terms and will not benefit from a portability feature in connection with a change of
control. See “Description of the New Notes—Change of Control.”

**Q:** **Can holders of the Senior Notes participate in the Exchange Offers?**

A: No. The Exchange Offers are only open to Eligible Holders of the Existing Notes.

**Q:** **Are there any other conditions to consummation of the Exchange Offers?**

A: Yes. The Exchange Offers are subject to certain customary conditions, including participation thresholds.
The Issuer may waive any such condition prior to the Expiration Time. See “The Exchange Offers—Settlement
_Conditions”._

**Q:** **Are any Existing Notes held by a Group company?**

A: Eligible Holders that are Direct Participants (as defined below) must submit Exchange Instructions in

###### DESCRIPTION OF THE NEW NOTES

_You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this “Description of the New Notes” under the_
_heading “Certain Definitions” below. For purposes of this “Description of the New Notes,” references to the_
_“Issuer,” “we,” “our,” and “us” refer only to Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH and not to any of its_
_Subsidiaries._

The following is a description of the €   million in aggregate principal amount of 7[1]/2% Senior Secured Notes
due 2026 (the “Senior Secured Notes”). The Senior Secured Notes will be issued by Nidda Healthcare Holding
GmbH (the “Issuer”) under an indenture (the “Senior Secured Notes Indenture”), to be dated as of the New Issue
Date (as defined below), among, inter alios, the Issuer, Nidda Healthcare GmbH, EG SA (formerly, Eurogenerics
SA), Internis Pharmaceuticals Limited, Thornton & Ross Limited, STADA, Clonmel Healthcare Limited,
Centrafarm B.V., Crosspharma Limited, Britannia Pharmaceuticals Limited and Natures Aid Ltd, as guarantors,
U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”) and as security agent (in such capacity,
the “Security Agent”), and Elavon Financial Services DAC, as paying agent, in a private transaction that is not
subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Issue and Resale Restrictions.” The Senior
Secured Notes Indenture will not be qualified under, incorporate by reference or include, and will not be subject
to, any of the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act, including Section 316(b) thereof. Consequently, the Holders
will not be entitled to the protections provided under the Trust Indenture Act to holders of debt securities issued
under a qualified indenture, including among other things, those requiring the Trustee to resign in the event of
certain conflicts of interest and to inform Holders of certain relationships between it and us.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which an aggregate
principal amount of Senior Secured Notes to be determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion on the
Announcement Date, will be issued in connection with the Exchange Offers (as defined in the Offering
Memorandum). We may, subject to applicable law and the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, issue an
unlimited principal amount of additional Senior Secured Notes having identical terms and conditions (other than
the issue price) as the Senior Secured Notes (any such additional Senior Secured Notes actually issued, the
“Additional Senior Secured Notes”); provided that if any series of Additional Senior Secured Notes is not fungible
for U.S. federal income tax purposes with the Senior Secured Notes, such Additional Senior Secured Notes will
be issued with a separate ISIN code or common code from those assigned to the Senior Secured Notes. We will
only be permitted to issue Additional Senior Secured Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including the covenants restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the
Incurrence of Liens. See “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Liens.” Except as otherwise provided for in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, and_
if issued, Additional Senior Secured Notes, will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and
offers to purchase. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of the New Notes,” references to
the “Senior Secured Notes” include the Senior Secured Notes and any Additional Senior Secured Notes that are
actually issued under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below), and in the case of certain conflicts between the terms of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail.
The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and
security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement
action, the subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the
payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._

This “Description of the New Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Senior Secured
Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured
Security Documents. Since this description of the terms of the Senior Secured Notes is only a summary, you
should refer to the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and
the Senior Secured Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Issuer and your rights.
Copies of such documents will be available from us upon request on and after the New Issue Date.

The registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered
Holders will have rights under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to
enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Senior Secured Notes will not be registered under the
Securities Act and will be subject to certain transfer restrictions.

**General**

**_The Senior Secured Notes_**

The Senior Secured Notes will:

    - be general senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under “Security”;

    - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is
not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes (including obligations of the Issuer
under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Existing Notes and certain hedging obligations);

    - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes, including the Senior Notes
Guarantees;

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries (as defined below) that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Senior
Secured Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such obligation or
indebtedness;

    - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer
that are not Guarantors, including their obligations to their trade creditors;

    - be guaranteed by the Guarantors on a senior secured basis;

    - be secured by the Collateral (as defined below);

    - mature on August 21, 2026; provided that if (i) any Topco Notes have a maturity date falling on or
prior to September 30, 2025, and remain outstanding on June 30, 2025, the Senior Secured Notes
will mature on June 30, 2025; and (ii) if any Topco Notes have a maturity date falling after
September 30, 2025, but on or prior to August 21, 2026, and remain outstanding on the date falling
three months prior to such maturity date, the Senior Secured Notes will mature on the date falling
three months prior to such maturity date; and

    - be represented by one or more registered Senior Secured Notes in global form, but in certain
circumstances may be represented by Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes (as defined
below). See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the
Collateral (as defined below) on a _pari passu basis with all indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of_
payment to the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, including obligations under the
Senior Facilities Agreement, the Existing Notes and certain hedging obligations; _provided, however, that the_
Revolving Credit Facility may be re-designated as a “super senior” obligation under the Intercreditor Agreement,
and following such re-designation, Holders will only receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after
the obligations thereunder (and certain super senior hedging obligations) have been paid in full. See “Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral_
_Liens.”_

The Issuer is a holding company incorporated for the purposes of the STADA Acquisition, and the Issuer’s only
material assets consist of its indirect interests in its Subsidiaries. All of the operations of the Issuer are conducted
through its Subsidiaries. Therefore, the Issuer depends on the receipt of funds from its Subsidiaries (whether in
the form of dividends, other distributions, return on capital or payments with respect to intercompany obligations)
to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Secured Notes will
be structurally subordinated to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables
and lease obligations) of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors.

As of June 30, 2022, after giving _pro forma effect to the Exchange Offers and certain other transactions as_
described under “Capitalization,” the Issuer and its consolidated Subsidiaries would have had €4,913.2 million of
Indebtedness secured with a first-priority Lien on the Collateral, consisting of €3,028.2 million (equivalent) under
the Existing Senior Term Loans, €1,385.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes and €500.0

11


-----

million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes, in addition to €45.5 million of STADA Existing
Debt. As of June 30, 2022, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the Revolving Credit
Facility was not drawn.

**_The Senior Secured Notes Guarantees_**

On the New Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors on a senior secured basis.
In addition, if required by the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees,” certain
other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee (as defined below) in the future.

Once granted, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of each Guarantor will:

    - be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under “Security”;

    - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor that
is not subordinated in right of payment to such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of that Guarantor
(including obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Existing Notes and certain hedging
obligations);

    - rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
subordinated in right of payment to its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, including the Senior Notes
Guarantees;

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of that Guarantor
and its subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes
or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing
such indebtedness; and

    - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of that
Guarantor that do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes, including their obligations to trade
creditors.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent
the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial
assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable law. In addition, the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles as described
below under “Senior Secured Notes Guarantees—General.” By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s
obligation under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect
to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Senior Secured Notes
Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the New Notes —The insolvency laws of Germany and other
_applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United States or those of_
_another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations on the Senior Secured Guarantees and the_
_Security Interests, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and_
_enforceability.” The validity and enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the liability of each_
Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations
_on the Validity and Enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

On the New Issue Date, the Issuer will issue an aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes to be
determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion on the Announcement Date. The Senior Secured Notes will mature
on August 21, 2026; provided that if (i) any Topco Notes have a maturity date falling on or prior to September
30, 2025, and remain outstanding on June 30, 2025, the Senior Secured Notes will mature on June 30, 2025; and
(ii) if any Topco Notes have a maturity date falling after September 30, 2025, but on or prior to August 21, 2026,
and remain outstanding on the date falling three months prior to such maturity date, the Senior Secured Notes will
mature on the date falling three months prior to such maturity date. The Senior Secured Notes will be issued in
minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. While the Senior
Secured Notes may only be traded in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof, for the purpose of the International Central Securities Depositories (“ICSDs”), the minimum
denomination will be considered to be €1. For the avoidance of doubt, the ICSDs are not required to monitor or
enforce the minimum amount.

12


-----

The Senior Secured Notes (together with any Additional Senior Secured Notes) will be treated as a single class
for all purposes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including in respect of any amendment, waiver or other
modification of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or any other action by the Holders hereunder, except as
otherwise provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

Interest on overdue principal and interest on the Senior Secured Notes will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher than
the interest rate on the overdue principal or interest.

**_Interest on the Senior Secured Notes_**

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will accrue, at the rate of 7.5% per annum. Interest on the Senior Secured
Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on April 30 and October 31. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes
will be payable to the holder of record of such Senior Secured Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding
the related interest payment date.

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been
paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised
of twelve 30-day months.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be subject to applicable
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Senior Secured Notes
is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled
to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to
any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

The right of holders of beneficial interests in the Senior Secured Notes to receive the payment on such Senior
Secured Notes will be subject to the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable.

**_Methods of Receiving Payments on the Senior Secured Notes_**

Payments of principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, on the Senior
Secured Notes will be made by one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account specified by the registered Holder thereof (initially being the common depositary or its nominee for
Euroclear and Clearstream).

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive
_Registered Senior Secured Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents_
maintained for such purposes in London, United Kingdom. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered
Senior Secured Notes may be paid, at the option of the Issuer, by check mailed to the address of the Holder entitled
thereto as shown on the register of Holders of Senior Secured Notes for the Definitive Registered Senior Secured
Notes. See “Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Secured Notes” below.

**_Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Secured Notes_**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Senior Secured Notes in London, United Kingdom or
Dublin, Ireland (including the initial Paying Agent). The initial Paying Agent will be Elavon Financial Services
DAC.

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”). The initial
Registrar and the initial Transfer Agent will be Elavon Financial Services DAC. The Registrar will maintain a
register reflecting ownership of the Senior Secured Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and together with
the Transfer Agent, will facilitate transfers of the Senior Secured Notes on behalf of the Issuer. A register of the
Senior Secured Notes shall be left at the registered office of the Issuer. In case of inconsistency between the
register of Senior Secured Notes kept by the Registrar and the one kept by the Issuer at its registered office, the
register kept by the Issuer shall prevail.

Upon written notice to the Trustee, the Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent for the
Senior Secured Notes without prior notice to the Holders of such Senior Secured Notes. However, for so long as
Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Authority”) and if
and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any change of
Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or
Registrar in respect of the Senior Secured Notes.

13


-----

**Senior Secured Notes Guarantees**

**_General_**

The Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors. Each Senior Secured
Notes Guarantee will be a full and unconditional Guarantee of the Issuer’s obligations under the Senior Secured
Notes, subject to the contractual limitations discussed below. In addition, as described under “Certain
_Covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security_
Principles, certain Subsidiaries of the Issuer that guarantee the Senior Facilities in the future or any Credit Facility
or Public Debt, in each case of the Issuer or a Guarantor, shall also enter into a supplemental senior secured notes
indenture as a Guarantor and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Agreed Security Principles will apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under
the Senior Facilities and the Senior Secured Notes. The Agreed Security Principles will include restrictions on the
granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other
legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules,
“thin capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the
time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders.

Each Senior Secured Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the
Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under the Agreed
Security Principles, to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this
limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than
amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation
under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the New Notes—Corporate
_benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Senior Secured Notes_
_Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the_
_Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral” and “—The insolvency laws of_
_Germany and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency laws of the United_
_States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations on the Senior Secured Notes_
_Guarantees and the Security Interests, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their_
_validity and enforceability.”_

A portion of the operations of the Issuer will be conducted through Subsidiaries that are not expected to become
Guarantors, including Subsidiaries exempt from becoming Guarantors or having security granted over their shares
or assets under the Agreed Security Principles, such as those Subsidiaries organized in Russia, Serbia and
Vietnam. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors
holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any)
of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted
Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted
Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders. The Senior Secured
Notes and each Senior Secured Notes Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including
trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the
Guarantors) and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any).

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors accounted for 68% of the
consolidated sales and 82% of the consolidated EBITDA of the STADA Group. In addition, as of June 30, 2022,
the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors accounted for 90% of the consolidated assets of the STADA Group. As of
June 30, 2022, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, the Issuer’s Subsidiaries organized in Russia,
Serbia and Vietnam would have had third-party financial indebtedness (excluding finance leases) of €371.1
million, €38.5 million and €6.6 million, respectively. Although the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will limit the
Incurrence of Indebtedness and the issuance of Disqualified Stock of the Issuer and Preferred Stock of Restricted
Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not
considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. See
“Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Certain Definitions—Indebtedness.”

**_Senior Secured Notes Guarantee Release_**

The Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and be released:

14


-----

    - upon a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, merger, or
amalgamation) of any Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a
holding company of such Guarantor) as a result of which such Guarantor would no longer be a
Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor
(other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case if such sale, exchange, transfer or
other disposition does not violate the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

    - upon the designation in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture of the Guarantor as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary;

    - upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured
Notes in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, as provided in “Defeasance” and
“Satisfaction and Discharge”;

    - pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

    - as described under “Amendments and Waivers”;

    - as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “Certain Covenants—
_Additional Guarantees”;_

    - upon payment in full of principal and interest and all other obligations on the Senior Secured Notes;
or

    - as a result of a transaction permitted by “Merger and Consolidation.”

The Trustee shall, subject to receipt of certain documentation requested pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, take all necessary actions at the reasonable request and cost of the Issuer, including the granting of
releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate
any release of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary
protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without the
consent of the Holders and will not require any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee.

**Security**

**_General_**

The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees in respect thereof will be secured on a firstpriority basis by Security Interests in:

    - a pledge of the shares in the Issuer, a security assignment of any structural intercompany receivables
owed by the Issuer to the Company and a pledge of the material bank accounts of the Issuer;

    - a pledge of the shares in German Holdco, a security assignment of any structural intercompany
receivables owed by German Holdco to the Issuer and a pledge of the material bank accounts of
German Holdco;

    - a pledge of the shares in STADA acquired by the Issuer or German Holdco and a security assignment
of any structural intercompany receivables owed by any material company to the Issuer or German
Holdco;

    - a security assignment of any structural intercompany receivables owed to the Issuer by any material
subsidiary (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement); and

    - pledges of the shares in each Senior Secured Notes Guarantor and Laboratorio STADA, S.L.U. and
material bank accounts of each Senior Secured Notes Guarantor,

(collectively, and together with any and all other assets from time to time in which a Security Interest will be
granted pursuant to any Senior Secured Security Document to secure the obligations under the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes and/or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, the “Collateral”).

15


-----

The Collateral also secures the Senior Facilities, the Existing Notes and certain Hedging Obligations on a firstpriority basis. The Senior Notes are secured on a second-priority basis by Security Interests in a pledge of the
shares in the Issuer and a security assignment of any structural intercompany receivables owed by the Issuer to
the Company. On the New Issue Date, the Security Interests in the Collateral will be reaffirmed pursuant to
customary confirmation agreements in favor of or granted under Senior Secured Security Documents and, as a
result, will extend to the liabilities under the Senior Secured Notes. The Security Interests in the Collateral will be
granted to the Security Agent on behalf of and for the benefit of the Holders.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest” and “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Issuer and the Restricted_
Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of
Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including, subject to certain requirements described
herein, Additional Senior Secured Notes, as permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility may be re-designated as a “super senior”
obligation under the Intercreditor Agreement, and following such re-designation, Holders will only receive
proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after the obligations thereunder (and certain super senior hedging
obligations) have been paid in full. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement” and “Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Senior Secured Security Documents to the Security Agent on behalf
of the Holders and holders of the other secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral. Any other assets
subject to Security Interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Senior Secured Notes,
any Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.”
All Collateral will be subject to the limitations that are applicable to Senior Secured Notes Guarantees granted by
the same entity, the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed
by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and_
_Security Interests.”_

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Liens,” certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over property, rights_
and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles. The
following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles, which include, among
others:

    - general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, corporate benefit,
fraudulent preference, equitable subordination, “transfer pricing,” “thin capitalization,” “earnings
stripping,” “controlled foreign corporation” and other tax restrictions, “exchange control
restrictions,” “capital maintenance” rules and “liquidity impairment” rules, retention of title claims,
employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of the
Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) to provide a guarantee or security
or may require that the guarantee or security be limited as to amount or otherwise and, if so, the
guarantee or security will be limited accordingly; _provided that, to the extent requested by the_
Security Agent before signing any applicable security or accession document, the relevant member
of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without adverse
impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such
guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

    - the determination that the time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility,
stamp duty, registration taxes, notarial costs and all applicable legal fees) related to granting the
relevant guarantee and/or security (including in respect of the security, the extent of its perfection
and/or registration) will not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the relevant secured parties
of obtaining such guarantee or security;

    - the exclusion from any guarantee or security of any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract,
lease, license, instrument or other third-party arrangement, which may prevent or condition the asset

16


-----

from being charged, secured or being subject to the applicable security document (including
requiring a consent of any third-party, supervisory board or works council (or equivalent)) and any
asset which, if subject to the applicable security document, would give a third-party the right to
terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations with respect to any member of
the Group in respect of the asset or require the relevant charger to take any action materially adverse
to the interests of the Group or any member thereof; provided that reasonable endeavors (exercised
for a specified period of time) to obtain consent to charging any asset (where otherwise prohibited)
shall be used by the Group if the Security Agent specifies prior to the date of the security or accession
document that the asset is material and the Issuer is satisfied that such endeavors will not involve
placing relationships with third parties in jeopardy;

- the agreement that members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into
security documents if they are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not
within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the
fiduciary or statutory duties of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or
contractual prohibition or restriction or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal or
criminal liability for any director or officer of or for any member of the Group, provided that, to the
extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any applicable security document or accession
document, the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring
material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such
obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

- the requirement that, to the extent legally effective, all security shall be given in favor of the Security
Agent and not the secured creditors individually (with the Security Agent to hold one set of security
documents for all the secured creditors); provided that it shall be permissible to use “parallel debt”
provisions where necessary (which shall be included in the Intercreditor Agreement and not the
individual security documents); and furthermore, the agreement that no member of the Group shall
be required to take any action in relation to any guarantees or security as a result of any assignment
or transfer of the Senior Secured Notes by a Holder;

- the limitation of guarantees and security so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration
and like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an amount to be agreed
between the Issuer and the Security Agent, and the agreement that where a class of assets to be
secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting security over the immaterial
assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security will be granted over the material
assets only;

- the agreement that security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favor of a thirdparty or any cash constituting regulatory capital or customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be
excluded from any relevant security document);

- the agreement it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over certain categories of
assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets;

- the agreement that no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover
or sharing provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement and guarantees and that security will not be
required from or over the assets of, any joint venture or similar arrangement, any minority interest
or any member of the Group that is not wholly owned by another member of the Group;

- that agreement that the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the
perfection of the security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on
the ability of the relevant member of the Group to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary
course as otherwise permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement (including dealing with the secured assets and all contractual counterparties or amending,
waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations, in each case prior
to an Event of Default which is continuing), and the agreement that any requirement under the
Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall
be subject to the Agreed Security Principles; and

- the agreement that other than a general security agreement and related filing, no perfection, filing or
other action will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of the Group or

in Russia, Serbia or Vietnam (the “Excluded Jurisdictions”) or otherwise over the shares of a
member of the Group located in an Excluded Jurisdiction.

As described above, all of the Collateral also secures the liabilities under the Senior Facilities, the Existing Notes
as well as certain Hedging Obligations and may also secure certain future Indebtedness. The proceeds from the
enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes. By
its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.
Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to the New Notes—The value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the New Notes may not be_
_sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the New Notes and such collateral may be reduced or diluted under_
_certain circumstances.”_

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Senior Secured
Security Documents (the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between (a) the lenders under the
Senior Facilities, (b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, (c) the Trustee, the Security Agent and
the Holders under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, (d) the trustee, the security agent and the holders of the
Senior Notes under the Senior Notes Indentures and (e) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness (including
Indebtedness that may be Incurred in the future) permitted to be secured by such Collateral, respectively, has been
established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, which provides, among other things, that the obligations
under the Senior Facilities, certain Hedging Obligations and the Senior Secured Notes are secured equally and
ratably by first-ranking Security Interests. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility may be re-designated as a
“super senior” obligation under the Intercreditor Agreement, and following such re-designation, Holders will only
receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after the obligations thereunder (and certain super senior
hedging obligations) have been paid in full. The obligations under the Senior Notes Guarantees shall rank in right
of priority and payment after liabilities owed, among others, under the Senior Facilities, certain Hedging
Obligations secured by the Collateral and the Senior Secured Notes, and obligations under the Senior Notes
Guarantees will be postponed and subordinated to, among others, obligations under the Senior Facilities, certain
Hedging Obligations and the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees. See “Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral_
_Liens.”_

**_Senior Secured Security Documents_**

Under the Senior Secured Security Documents, the Issuer, the Company and the Guarantors will grant security
over the Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under
the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The
Senior Secured Security Documents have been, or will be, entered into by the relevant security provider and the
Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into such Senior Secured Security Documents, the
Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and
the Holders of Senior Secured Notes from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent
also acts as an agent of the lenders under the Senior Facilities, the holders of the Senior Notes and the Existing
Notes, and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security Interests created in
favor of such parties.

In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of Security
Interests, the relevant Senior Secured Security Documents secures, or will secure, “parallel debt” obligations
created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent (and not the obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees). The parallel debt construct has not been fully tested
under law in certain of these jurisdictions. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the New Notes—The security
_interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral have been, or will be, granted to the Security Agent rather than_
_directly to the holders of the New Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Senior Secured Notes_
_Collateral may be restricted by local law.”_

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide, and the Intercreditor Agreement provides that, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Senior Secured Security
Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders
will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral, except through the Trustee under the

18


-----

Senior Secured Notes Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture)
provide instructions to the Security Agent for the Collateral (as applicable).

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Senior Secured
Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture have been discharged. However, the Security Interests
with respect to the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture may be released under certain
circumstances as provided under “—Release of Liens.”

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the Security
Interests created under the Senior Secured Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the
Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security
Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any
amounts under the Senior Secured Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the New Notes—
_The granting of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the_
_New Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods_
_for such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions.”_

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will restrict, and the Intercreditor Agreement restricts, the ability of the
Holders or the Trustee to enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created
by the Senior Secured Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the Security Agent in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. These limitations are described under “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and_
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and Security Interests.”_
The ability to enforce may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is
secured on the Collateral in compliance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors under the Senior Facilities, the Existing Notes, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured
by the Collateral and the Trustee have and, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, each Holder will be deemed to
have, appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured
Security Documents securing such Indebtedness.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting such Senior Secured Note, will
be deemed (without any further consent of the Holders) to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Senior Secured Security
Documents and perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically
given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Security Documents securing such
Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Senior Secured Security Documents; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply
with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the
Senior Secured Security Documents (including the execution of, and compliance with, any waiver,
modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Trustee or the
Security Agent on its behalf).

See the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the New Notes—The security interests in the Senior
_Secured Notes Collateral have been, or will be, granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders_
_of the New Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be_
_restricted by local law.”_

19


-----

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as
defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Additional
_Intercreditor Agreements.”_

**_Release of Liens_**

Release of the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral will be permitted under any one or more of the
following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “Merger and Consolidation”), if such
sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and is otherwise not prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes_
Indenture or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that this clause 1(b) shall not be relied upon in the
case of a transfer of Capital Stock or of accounts receivable (including intercompany loan receivables
and hedging receivables) to a Restricted Subsidiary (except to a Securitization Subsidiary) unless the
relevant property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to, a Lien in favor of the
Senior Secured Notes following such sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms
of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such
Guarantor;

(3) as described under “Amendments and Waivers”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior Secured Notes or legal
defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes, as provided
in “Defeasance” and “Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(5) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the release of the property and assets,
and Capital Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary; or

(6) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Senior Secured Security Documents will be released (a) in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may be
permitted by the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required) will take all necessary action reasonably requested by,
and at the cost of, the Issuer to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Senior Secured Security
Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the
Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such release). The Security
Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of
Counsel, each certifying which circumstance, as described above, giving rise to a release of the Security Interests
has occurred, and that such release complies with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Senior Secured Notes will be issued outside the United States to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S
under the Securities Act and will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the “Global Notes”). The Global Notes will be deposited with and registered in the
name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts
with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on
transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Issue and Resale

20


-----

_Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in_
Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the
applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a
Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it
will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
€100,000, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating
thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. It
is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Senior
Secured Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have
a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under “Issue and
_Resale Restrictions.”_

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Senior Secured Notes issued as Definitive Registered
Senior Secured Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of
€100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange,
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things,
furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the
transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay
any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without
charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be
entitled to treat the registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

On the New Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. However, in the
circumstances described below under “Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted
_Subsidiaries,” the Issuer will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries._
Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture.

**Proceeds Loan**

On August 21, 2017, the Company, as lender, and the Issuer, as borrower, entered into a loan agreement pursuant
to which the Company, as lender, loaned to the Issuer, as borrower, the gross proceeds of the 2017 Senior Notes
(as defined below) the “Original Proceeds Loan”). On November 27, 2018, the Company, as lender, and the
Issuer, as borrower, entered into a new proceeds loan agreement under which the proceeds of the 2018 Senior
Notes (as defined below) were loaned to the Issuer (the “2018 Proceeds Loan” and, together with the Original
Proceeds Loan, the “Proceeds Loans”).

The Proceeds Loans are denominated in Euros in a principal amount equal to the net proceeds of the applicable
series of Senior Notes. The Proceeds Loan Agreement requires the Issuer to make all payments thereunder on a
timely basis in order to ensure that the Company can satisfy its payment obligations under the Senior Notes,
including as to interest, principal, additional amounts, if any, and other required payments due under the Senior
Notes. All amounts payable under the Proceeds Loan Agreement are payable to such account or accounts with
such person or persons as the Company may designate. The maturity date of the Proceeds Loan is the same
maturity date as the maturity date of the Senior Notes. The Proceeds Loan is an unsecured obligation of the Issuer,
and is contractually subordinated to the obligations of the Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes, the Existing
Notes and the Senior Facilities pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The receivables under the
Proceeds Loan have been assigned by way of security, on a first-ranking basis, to the Security Agent for the benefit
of Holders, the holders of the Existing Notes and the Senior Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations, and, on a
second ranking basis, to the Security Agent for the benefit of holders of the Senior Notes.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below, and except as described under “Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” the Senior Secured
Notes will not be redeemable at the option of the Issuer.

At any time prior to April 30, 2024, the Issuer may redeem the Senior Secured Notes, in whole or in part, at its
option, upon notice as described under “Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of such Senior Secured Notes plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time prior to April 30, 2024, the Issuer may, at its option, during each calendar year
redeem up to 10% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including the original principal
amount of any Additional Senior Secured Notes), upon giving notice as described under “Selection and Notice,”
at a redemption price equal to 103.000% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes so redeemed, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time prior to April 30, 2024, the Issuer may, at its option, redeem Senior Secured
Notes, upon notice as described under “Selection and Notice,” with the Net Cash Proceeds received by the Issuer
from any Equity Offering at a redemption price equal to 107.500% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured
Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the
redemption date in an aggregate principal amount for all such redemptions not to exceed 40% of the original
aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including any Additional Senior Secured Notes);
_provided that:_

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related Equity
Offering; and

(2) not less than 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including
Additional Senior Secured Notes) issued under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture remains outstanding
immediately thereafter (excluding Senior Secured Notes held by the Issuer or any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries).

At any time and from time to time on or after April 30, 2024, the Issuer may redeem the Senior Secured Notes, in
whole or in part, upon notice as described under “Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to the
percentage of principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes so redeemed set forth below plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes redeemed, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date and
Additional Amounts, if any, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on April 30 of the year
indicated below:

**Redemption**

**Year** **Price**

2024 ............................................................................................................................................. 103.750%

2025 ............................................................................................................................................. 101.875%

2026, and thereafter ..................................................................................................................... 100.000%

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the maturity date of the Senior Secured Notes is accelerated pursuant to the
proviso in the second sentence of the first paragraph under “—Principal, Maturity and Interest” above, the Issuer
may redeem the Senior Secured Notes, in whole or in part, upon notice as described under “Selection and Notice,”
at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes so redeemed plus accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes redeemed, to, but excluding, the
redemption date.

**_Other Redemption Terms_**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Senior Secured Notes, including a
Change of Control Offer (as defined below) or Asset Disposition Offer (as defined below), if Holders of Senior
Secured Notes of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Senior Secured
Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Senior Secured Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any
third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases, all of the Senior Secured Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have the right upon not less than

22


-----

10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such tender offer expiration date,
to redeem the Senior Secured Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part following such purchase at
a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender
offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, such redemption date.

Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer and
its Subsidiaries may repurchase the Senior Secured Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or
otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “Selection and Notice” below.

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Senior
Secured Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund**

The Issuer will not be required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect
to the Senior Secured Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase
Senior Secured Notes as described under “Change of Control” and “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of
_Assets and Subsidiary Stock.”_

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of any series of the Senior Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or
Registrar will select the Senior Secured Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal
securities exchange, if any, on which the Senior Secured Notes are listed, as certified to the Paying Agent or
Registrar by the Issuer, and in compliance with the requirements of Euroclear and Clearstream, or if the Senior
Secured Notes are not so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Senior Secured Notes
are not held through Euroclear and Clearstream or Euroclear and Clearstream prescribe no method of selection,
on a _pro rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Senior Secured Note in an unauthorized denomination_
remains outstanding after such redemption; _provided, however, that no Senior Secured Note of €100,000 in_
aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Senior Secured Notes in integral multiples
of €1,000 shall be redeemed. The Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar shall not be liable for selections
made under this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least 10 days but not more
than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Senior Secured Notes to be redeemed at the address of
such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream, except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than
60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Senior Secured
Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

Notice of any redemption of the Senior Secured Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be given prior to the
completion of a transaction (including, but not limited to, an Equity Offering, an Incurrence of Indebtedness, a
Change of Control or other transaction) and any redemption notice may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to
one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a related transaction. If such
redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe
each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be
delayed until such time (but not more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption was sent) as any or all
such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded
in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the
redemption date as so delayed. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption
price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another
Person.

If and for so long as any Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the
extent the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any such notice to the Holders
of the relevant Senior Secured Notes and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Authority
of any change in the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes outstanding.

23


-----

If any Senior Secured Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Senior
Secured Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the
original Senior Secured Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original
Senior Secured Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Senior Secured
Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to
the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), Senior Secured Notes
called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the
Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Senior Secured Notes or
portions of them called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Senior Secured Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than
10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but
excluding the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on
the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts,
as defined below under “Withholding Taxes,” if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption
Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or written interpretation of such
laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or order by a court of
competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) (each of the foregoing in clauses
(1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Senior Secured Notes would
be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Senior Secured Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor,
only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can
make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be avoided
by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a
new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be publicly announced and
become effective on or after the New Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the New Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall
apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on the
Senior Secured Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a
party to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such
successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under
“Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier than
60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional
Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the
foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such
redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right to so redeem
have been satisfied and that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the relevant Payor
taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) a written opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized
standing qualified under the laws of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional
Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely conclusively on
such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent
described above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the
Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity) (each, a
“Payor”) in respect of the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, as
applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes

24


-----

unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law or by the relevant taxing authority’s
interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed
or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Secured Note or Senior Secured
Notes Guarantee is made or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having
the power to tax (including the jurisdiction of the Paying Agent); or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes,
or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental
authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing
_Jurisdiction”),_

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor or the Paying
Agent with respect to any Senior Secured Note or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, including (without
limitation) payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with
such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net
amounts received in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such
withholding or deduction from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have
been received in respect of such payments on any such Senior Secured Note or Senior Secured Notes Guarantee
in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be
payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present
or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member,
partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an
estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (including, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national of, or
carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in or place of management present in,
or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any
connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Senior Secured Note or the
receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Senior Secured Note, the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture or a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the
beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the Payor
addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such
withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other
evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to
make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters,
which is required by a law, statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Tax, but, in each case, only to the
extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to do so;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Senior Secured
Note for payment (where Senior Secured Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Senior Secured
Notes and presentation is required) more than 30 days after the later of the applicable payment date or
the date the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that
the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Senior Secured Note been presented
on the last day of such 30 day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment with respect to
the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(6) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) or otherwise imposed pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the
Code, in each case, as of the New Issue Date (and any amended or successor version that is substantively

25


-----

comparable), any regulations or agreements thereunder, official interpretations thereof or similar law or
regulation implementing an intergovernmental agreement relating thereto;

(7) any Taxes imposed in Germany due to the relevant Holder being resident for tax purposes in a noncooperative tax jurisdiction (nicht kooperatives Steuerhoheitsgebiet) as set out in the German Act
Combating Tax Avoidance and Unfair Tax Competition and Amending Further Acts (Gesetz zur Abwehr
_von Steuervermeidung und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb und zur Änderung weiterer Gesetze) and the_
respective legislative decree (Rechtsverordnung) as amended or replaced from time to time; or

(8) any combination of the items (1) through (7) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or
any Person other than the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler
with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been
entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Senior
Secured Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld
to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide certified copies of tax
receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of
such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent). Such copies
shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the
Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Senior Secured
Note or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will
deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will
be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying
Agent to pay Additional Amounts on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts
arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s
Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely
on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or this “Description of the New Notes”
there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Senior Secured
Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Secured Notes or any Senior Secured
Notes Guarantee,

(5) such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and reimburse each applicable Holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court
or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto)
or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties
with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, issuance, delivery,
registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments with respect to any Senior Secured Notes, any Senior Secured
Notes Guarantee, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto
(other than in each case, in connection with a transfer of the Senior Secured Notes after this offering).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in

26


-----

which any successor to a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise
resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the
Senior Secured Notes (or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Person, or any
political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless (i) a third-party makes
a change of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Issuer has previously or substantially concurrently
therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Senior Secured Notes as described
under “Optional Redemption,” the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Senior Secured Notes (equal to
€100,000 in principal amount or in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof; provided that Senior Secured
Notes of €100,000 or less in principal amount may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) pursuant to the
offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal
amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of
repurchase. Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a
notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear
and Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Senior Secured Notes at the
address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures
of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and
offering to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice,
which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant
to the procedures required by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case
of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the
SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies
certain conditions.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not
contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured
Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the Senior
Facilities Agreement that permits the Senior Facilities lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder.
Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which
would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control.
Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes
could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial
effect of such repurchase on the Issuer.

The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Senior Secured Notes following the occurrence of a Change of
Control may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available
when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Senior Secured
Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the
removal of incumbent management.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including
acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise
affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are
contained in the covenants described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that such restrictions can be_
waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then
outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged
transaction.

27


-----

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a thirdparty makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the
Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control
Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Senior Secured Notes has been given pursuant to the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture as described under “Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the
payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to
the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting
the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such phrase under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of
Senior Secured Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described
above.

The provisions in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to
repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the
written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding.

If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the
extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any Change of Control
Offer.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.
For the avoidance of doubt, the consummation of the Transactions shall not be prohibited by the covenants below.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

Following the first day that:

(a) the Senior Secured Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture,

(c) then, beginning on that day and continuing until the Reversion Date (as defined below), the
Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the provisions of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture summarized under the following headings (collectively, the “Suspended
_Covenants”):_

        - “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

        - “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

        - “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

        - “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

        - “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

        - “—Additional Guarantees”; and

###### • the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of “Merger and Consolidation—The
_Issuer.”_

28


-----

If at any time the Senior Secured Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status, then the Suspended Covenants
will thereafter be reinstated as if such covenants had never been suspended (the “Reversion Date”) and will be
applicable pursuant to the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (including in connection with performing
any calculation or assessment to determine compliance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture),
unless and until the Senior Secured Notes subsequently attain Investment Grade Status (in which event the
Suspended Covenants shall no longer be in effect for such time that the Senior Secured Notes maintain an
Investment Grade Status); provided, however, that no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be
deemed to exist under the Senior Secured Notes Documents with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on,
and none of the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries shall bear any liability with respect to such Suspended
Covenants for, any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any
time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising prior to the Reversion Date, regardless of whether such actions
or events would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in effect during such period.
The period of time between the date of suspension of the covenants and the Reversion Date is referred to as the
“Suspension Period.”

On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period (other than any Indebtedness
Incurred under the Existing Senior Term Loans or the Revolving Credit Facility) will be deemed to have been
outstanding on the New Issue Date so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(c) of the second paragraph
of “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” On and after the Reversion Date, all Liens created during the Suspension
Period will be considered Permitted Liens pursuant to clause (11) of such definition. Calculations made after the
Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments (as defined below) under “—Limitation
_on Restricted Payments” will be made as though the covenants described under “—Limitation on Restricted_
_Payments” had been in effect since the Original Issue Date and prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period._
Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be
made as Restricted Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” On the Reversion Date, the amount
of Excess Proceeds (as defined below) shall be reset at zero. Any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the
Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period will be deemed to have been
outstanding on the New Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (6) of the second paragraph
under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.” Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of “—Limitation on
_Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during the Suspension Period_
will be deemed to have existed on the New Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (1) of the
second paragraph under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.” On and
after each Reversion Date, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the
transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such contract and
such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period.

In addition, any future obligation to grant further Senior Secured Notes Guarantees shall be released. All such
further obligation to grant Senior Secured Notes Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date.

There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status.

The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Senior Secured Notes, shall not be deemed to have
any knowledge of the ratings of the Senior Secured Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Senior
Secured Notes achieve Investment Grade Status or upon the occurrence of the Reversion Date. The Issuer shall
notify the Trustee that the conditions under this covenant have been satisfied, although such notification shall not
be a condition for suspension of the applicable covenants to be effective.

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness (including
Acquired Indebtedness) and the Issuer will not issue Disqualified Stock and will not permit any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries to issue Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the Issuer and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and the Issuer may issue Disqualified Stock and any
of the Restricted Subsidiaries may issue Preferred Stock, if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro
_forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio_
of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries is at least 2.00 to 1.00; provided that the amount of Indebtedness
Incurred and the amount of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued pursuant to the foregoing shall not cause
the Non-Guarantor Debt Cap to be exceeded.

29


-----

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness (collectively,
“Permitted Debt”):

(1) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness under any Credit
Facility (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) in an
aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed the sum of:

(a) (i) €2,660.0 million; (ii) plus £316.0 million; plus (iii) €400.0 million; plus

(b) an amount equal to the greater of (i) €500.0 million and (ii) 100.0% of LTM EBITDA; plus;

(c) the maximum amount of Senior Secured Indebtedness such that after giving pro forma effect to
such Incurrence the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries do not exceed 5.00 to 1.00 (with any Indebtedness Incurred under clause
(b) above on the date of determination of the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio
not being included in the calculation of Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio under
this subclause (c) on such date of determination but not, for the avoidance of doubt, excluded
from any such calculation made on any such subsequent date); plus

(d) the maximum amount of Indebtedness that is not Senior Secured Indebtedness such that after
giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence (and assuming for the purpose of such calculation
that the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries is no less than an amount equal to the greater of the Consolidated Senior Secured
Net Leverage Ratio as of such date of determination and 5.00:1.00) the Consolidated Total Net
Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries does not exceed 5.70 to 1.00 (with
any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (b) above on the date of determination of the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio not being included in the calculation of Consolidated
Total Net Leverage Ratio under this clause (d) on such date of determination but not, for the
avoidance of doubt, excluded from any such calculation made on any such subsequent date),

_provided that (i) any Indebtedness Incurred and outstanding pursuant to subclauses (a), (b) or (c) above shall be_
deemed to be Senior Secured Indebtedness, whether or not so secured, solely for purposes of calculating the
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio for subclause (c) and (ii) any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to
this clause (1) may be refinanced at any time if such refinancing does not exceed the greater of (I) the aggregate
principal amount of Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred pursuant to this clause (1) on the date of such
refinancing and (II) the aggregate principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced at such time (together
with an amount necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses, including any premium
and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection
with such refinancing); _provided further that the amount of Indebtedness Incurred and Disqualified Stock or_
Preferred Stock issued pursuant to clauses (1)(b), (1)(c) and (1)(d) shall not cause the Non-Guarantor Debt Cap
to be exceeded;

(2) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other obligations of the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness or other obligations is not
prohibited by the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) Indebtedness represented by (a) Indebtedness of the STADA Group outstanding as of the New Issue Date
or Incurred under a facility committed and as in effect as of the New Issue Date, in either case, in respect
of factoring financings, securitizations, receivables financings or similar arrangements, (b)(i) the Existing
Notes and the Senior Secured Notes (other than any Additional Senior Secured Notes issued after the
New Issue Date), including any Guarantee thereof, in each case, outstanding on the New Issue Date after
giving _pro forma effect to the Transactions, (ii) any Guarantees of the Senior Notes (excluding_
Guarantees of any additional Senior Notes issued after the New Issue Date), (iii) the Proceeds Loans,
and (iv) any loans pursuant to which proceeds of any Indebtedness of a Parent Entity are lent to the
Issuer, to the extent that such Indebtedness is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or
is otherwise considered Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, and such Guarantees or
the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, as the case may be, as are not prohibited by the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, (c) any Indebtedness of the STADA Group (other than Indebtedness Incurred pursuant

30


-----

to clauses (1) and (3) above) outstanding on the New Issue Date and any Guarantees thereof, (d)
Refinancing Indebtedness (including with respect to the Senior Secured Notes and any Guarantee
thereof) Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in this clause (4) and clause (5)(b) of this

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) subject to clause (3) below, in the event that all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of
Permitted Debt or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer, in
its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and
only be required to include, in any manner that complies with this covenant, the amount and type of such
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) in the first paragraph above
or one of the clauses of the second paragraph of this covenant, and Indebtedness permitted by this
covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but
may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this
covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(2) with respect to clauses (5)(a), (11) and (13) of the second paragraph of this covenant, if at any time that
the Issuer would be entitled to have Incurred any then outstanding item of Indebtedness pursuant to the
first paragraph of this covenant or pursuant to clause (1)(c) or (1)(d) of the second paragraph of this
covenant, such item of Indebtedness shall be automatically reclassified into an item of Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or pursuant to clause (1)(c) or (1)(d) of the
second paragraph of this covenant, as applicable;

(3) all Indebtedness under the Existing Senior Term Loans outstanding on the New Issue Date (and any
Indebtedness that refinances or replaces such Existing Senior Term Loans) shall be deemed to have been
Incurred pursuant to clause (1)(a)(i) and (1)(a)(ii), as applicable, of the second paragraph of this covenant,
and the Issuer shall not be permitted to reclassify all or any portion of such Indebtedness;

(4) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under
a Credit Facility, re-borrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to “cash sweep” or “clean down”
provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to
be repaid periodically shall only be deemed for the purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on
the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent re-borrowing thereof;

(5) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such
Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest
and any fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts,
premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

33


-----

(6) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination
of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(7) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred
pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to any clause of the second
paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other
similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(8) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock
of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or
repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation
preference thereof;

(9) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a
revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or commits to Incur
any Lien pursuant to clause (29) of the definition of “Permitted Liens,” the Incurrence or issuance thereof
for all purposes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including without limitation for purposes of
calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or
the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or usage of clauses (1) through (20) of the
preceding paragraph (if any) for borrowings and re-borrowings thereunder (and including issuance and
creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the Issuer’s option, either (a) be
determined on the date of such revolving credit facility or such entry into or increase in commitments
(assuming that the full amount thereof has been borrowed as of such date) or other Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated
Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test or
other provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any
borrowing or re-borrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’
acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage
Ratio, as applicable, or other provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture at the time of any
borrowing or re-borrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and
creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause
(a) shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net
Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and, to the extent of the usage of clauses (1) through (20) of the preceding
paragraph (if any), shall be deemed to be Incurred and outstanding under such clauses) or (b) be
determined on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any such facility or increased commitment,
and in each case, the Issuer may revoke such determination at any time and from time to time;

(10) in the event that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (x) Incurs Indebtedness to finance an acquisition or
(y) assumes Indebtedness of Persons that are acquired by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or
merged into the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture or (z) is subject to a Change of Control, the date of determination of the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net
Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall, at the option of the Issuer, be (a) the date that a definitive agreement
for such acquisition or Change of Control is entered into and the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as
applicable, shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such acquisition, Change of Control and the
other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness
and the use of proceeds thereof) consistent with the definition of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as
applicable, and, for the avoidance of doubt, (A) if any such ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations
in such ratio (including due to fluctuations in the Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer or the target
company) at or prior to the consummation of the relevant acquisition or Change of Control, such ratios
will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of
determining whether such acquisition and any related transactions are permitted hereunder and (B) such
ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such acquisition or related transactions; provided
_that if the Issuer elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive_

34


-----

agreement, (i) any such transaction shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreement
is entered into and to be outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any ratios under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the earlier of the date of
consummation of such acquisition or the date such agreement is terminated or expires without
consummation of such acquisition and (ii) to the extent any covenant baskets were utilized in satisfying
any covenants, such baskets shall be deemed utilized until the earlier of the date of consummation of
such acquisition or the date such agreement is terminated or expires without consummation of such
acquisition, but any calculation of Consolidated EBITDA for purposes of other Incurrences of
Indebtedness or Liens or making of Restricted Payments (not related to such acquisition) shall not reflect
such acquisition until it has been consummated or (b) the date such Indebtedness is Incurred or assumed
or such Change of Control occurs;

(11) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to
refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant
measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing
would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the
percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA
restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing
Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus
premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance, costs and fees in connection with such refinancing;
and

(12) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal
to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the
form of additional shares or Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or
obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of
Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “Limitation on Indebtedness.”

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not
permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “Limitation on Indebtedness,”
the Issuer shall be in default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness denominated in a
given currency, the Currency Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness (or liquidation
preference in the case of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock) denominated in another currency shall be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, or,
at the option of the Issuer, first committed or first Incurred or upon execution of the definitive documentation in
respect thereof (whichever yields the lower Currency Equivalent); provided that if such Indebtedness is Incurred
to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in another currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable
currency denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on
the date of such refinancing, such currency denominated restriction, as applicable, shall be deemed not to have
been exceeded so long as the principal amount (or liquidation preference in the case of Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock) of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount (or liquidation preference
in the case of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock) set forth in sub-clause (3) of the definition of “Refinancing
_Indebtedness”._

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result
of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance
other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated
based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is
denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments described in clauses (1)
through (25) above, and/or is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or constitutes a
Permitted Investment, the Issuer will be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion

Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any cash
Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any non-cash Restricted Payment,
property or assets other than cash shall be determined conclusively by the Issuer acting in good faith.

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries in a Permitted
Investment to purchase or otherwise acquire Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Parent Entity or any
of the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the Capital Stock or any Parent Entity
and to Affiliates thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer will not be deemed to be a “direct or indirect”
action by the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a
Restricted Subsidiary and, in the case of the Company, limited in all respects to those of its assets constituting
Collateral), whether owned on the New Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income
or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case
of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets
that are not Permitted Liens if the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture are directly secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect
to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is
so secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture under (a)(2) in the preceding paragraph will be automatically and unconditionally
released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates, and (ii) otherwise

42


-----

as set forth under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and/or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and/or under the relevant Senior Secured Security Document.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness
outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property
securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to create or otherwise cause or permit to exist
or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

Subsidiary,

application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to
other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an
encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Senior Facilities), (b)
the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (c) any other agreement or
instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the New Issue Date;

(15) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to
in clauses (1) to (14) of this paragraph or this clause (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any
amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clauses (1) to (14) of this
paragraph or this clause (15); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to
such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any
material respect to the Holders (taken as a whole) than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in
the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or
other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Issuer).

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by way of
relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise)
at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on the date of contractually
agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Issuer, of the shares and assets
subject to such Asset Disposition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a
Permitted Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), with a purchase price in excess of the greater of (a) €50.0 million
and (b) 10.0% of LTM EBITDA, at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset Disposition
(including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities,
contingent or otherwise) received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in
the form of cash or Cash Equivalents; and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied:

(a) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is required
by the terms of any Indebtedness) to prepay, repay or purchase any Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary) or any Senior Secured Indebtedness, including Indebtedness under
any Credit Facility (including the Senior Facilities) (or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect
thereof) within 360 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the
receipt of such Net Available Cash; _provided, however, that, in connection with any_
prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (a), the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment
(if any) to be reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or
purchased; provided further that to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected
to prepay, repay or purchase any amount of Senior Secured Indebtedness at a price not less than
par and has extended such offer to the Holders on at least a pro rata basis, to the extent the
creditors in respect of such Senior Secured Indebtedness (including any Holders) elect not to
tender their Senior Secured Indebtedness for such prepayment, repayment or purchase, the
Issuer will be deemed to have applied an amount of Net Available Cash equal to such amount
not tendered under this paragraph (A), and such amount shall not increase the amount of Excess
Proceeds; or

(b) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to invest in
Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted
Subsidiary equal to the amount of Net Available Cash received by the Issuer or another
Restricted Subsidiary) within 360 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition
and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that a binding agreement
shall be treated as a permitted application of Net Available Cash from the date of such
commitment with the good faith expectation that an amount equal to Net Available Cash will
be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an “Acceptable

45


-----

_Commitment”) and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated_
for any reason before such amount is applied, then such Net Available Cash shall constitute
Excess Proceeds,

_provided further that, pending the final application of the amount of any such Net Available Cash in accordance_
with clause (a) or (b) above, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or
otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that (x) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any
Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply
with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law (including financial assistance and corporate
benefit restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of the relevant directors) or (y) a distribution of any or all of
the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (to
the extent necessary to comply with this covenant) could result in material adverse Tax consequences, as
determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion, the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be
required to be applied in compliance with this covenant.

The amount of any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be
applied or invested as provided in the first paragraph of this covenant will be deemed to constitute “Excess
_Proceeds” under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. On the 361st day (or such longer period permitted by clause_
(b) of the first paragraph of this covenant) after the later of an Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net
Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture exceeds
€50.0 million in a single transaction, the Issuer will within 10 Business Days be required to make an offer (“Asset
_Disposition Offer”) to all Holders of Senior Secured Notes issued under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and,_
to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to repay, prepay or
purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness
to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be repaid, prepaid or purchased out of the Excess Proceeds,
at an offer price in respect of the Senior Secured Notes in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of
the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to,
but not including, the date of repayment, prepayment or purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and
with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of
€1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver notice of such Asset Disposition Offer electronically or by firstclass mail, with a copy to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing
in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Asset Disposition and offering to repurchase the
Senior Secured Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no
earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures
required by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and described in such notice. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing
obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition by making an Asset Disposition
Offer with respect to all Net Available Cash prior to the expiration of the relevant 360 days (or such longer period
provided above) or with respect to any unapplied Excess Proceeds.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer
may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.
If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by
Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of
Excess Proceeds, the Issuer shall allocate the Excess Proceeds among the Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness to be repaid, prepaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount
of tendered Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness provided that the Issuer shall not be required to
select and purchase Senior Secured Notes or other Pari Passu Indebtedness in an unauthorized denomination.
Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes is denominated
in a currency other than Euros, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes shall not exceed
the net amount of funds in Euros that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into Euros.

46


-----

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) and the
release of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness or other liability
in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from the
transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents
within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such
Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from
any guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received
after the New Issue Date from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; and

(5) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset
Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash
Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater
of (a) €100.0 million and (b) 20.0% of LTM EBITDA (with the fair market value of each item of
Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value).

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange
Act, conflict with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable
securities laws, rules and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue thereof.

Notwithstanding any other provision in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to the contrary, the provisions of the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior
Secured Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding.

The Senior Facilities Agreement and the Existing Notes Indenture may prohibit or limit, and future credit
agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from
purchasing any Senior Secured Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from
purchasing the Senior Secured Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Senior
Secured Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not
obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Senior Secured Notes.
In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Senior Secured Notes would constitute a Default under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to enter into or conduct any transaction or series
of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any
service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related transactions being an “Affiliate
_Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of (i) €37.5 million and (ii) 7.5% of LTM_
EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable
transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such
transaction in arm’s-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of (a) €75.0
million and (b) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA, the terms of such Affiliate Transaction have been approved by
a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer.

47


-----

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (2) above if such
Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors of the Issuer, if any.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Restricted Payments,” or any Permitted Investment;_

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity related interests or other securities, or other
payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or entering
into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other compensation arrangements,
options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any
Parent Entity, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans,
participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health,
insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or
arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants
approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, in each case in the ordinary course of business or
consistent with past practice;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any (a) transaction between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries and
(b) merger, amalgamation or consolidation with any Parent Entity, provided that such Parent Entity shall
have no material liabilities and no material assets other than cash, Cash Equivalents and the Capital Stock
of the Issuer and such merger, amalgamation or consolidation is otherwise permitted under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture;

(5) the payment of compensation, fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities
(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on
behalf of, directors, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or employees of the Issuer, any Parent
Entity or any Restricted Subsidiary (whether directly or indirectly and including through any Controlled
Investment Affiliate of such directors, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or employees);

(6) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries under the
terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any
agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the New Issue Date, as these agreements and instruments
may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed or refinanced from time to time in
accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders
(taken as a whole) in any material respect;

(7) any transaction with a Securitization Subsidiary effected as part of a Qualified Securitization Financing
or Receivables Facility, any disposition or repurchase of Securitization Assets, Receivables Assets or
related assets in connection with any Qualified Securitization Financing or Receivables Facility;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, joint venture partners, suppliers, contractors, distributors or
purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary course of business or consistent
with past practice, which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable
determination of the Board of Directors of the Issuer or the senior management of the Issuer or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that could reasonably have
been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Issuer or an Associate or similar entity which would constitute an
Affiliate Transaction solely (i) because the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in or otherwise
controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity or (ii) due to the fact that a director of such Person is
also a director of the Issuer or any direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Issuer (provided, however, that

48


-----

such director abstains from voting as a director of the Issuer or such direct or indirect Parent Entity of
the Issuer, as the case may be, on any matter involving such other Person);

(10) any (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preferred Stock)
of the Issuer or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock or Subordinated
Shareholder Funding and the granting of registration and other customary rights (and the performance of
the related obligations) in connection therewith or any contribution to capital of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary and (b) amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to any Subordinated
Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable; provided that such
Subordinated Shareholder Funding, as amended or otherwise modified, will continue to satisfy the
requirements described in the definition of “Subordinated Shareholder Funding”;

(11) (a) any payments by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or
indirectly), including to its affiliates or its designees, of annual management, consulting, monitoring,
refinancing, transaction, subsequent transaction exit fees, advisory fees and related costs and reasonable
expenses and indemnitees in connection therewith and any termination fees (including any such cash
lump sum or present value fee upon the consummation of a corporate event, including an Initial Public
Offering) and (b) any customary payments by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted
Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including through any Parent Entity) for financial advisory,
financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect of other investment banking activities,
including in connection with acquisitions or divestitures, which are in the case of each of clauses (a) and
(b) approved by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Issuer in good faith;

(12) payment to any Permitted Holder of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Permitted Holder in
connection with its direct or indirect investment in the Issuer and its Subsidiaries;

(13) the Transactions and the payment of all costs and expenses (including all legal, accounting and other
professional fees and expenses) related to the Transactions;

(14) transactions in which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, delivers to the Trustee
a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the requirements of clause (1) of the
preceding paragraph;

(15) the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of its obligations under
the terms of, any equityholders agreement (including any registration rights agreement or purchase
agreements related thereto) to which it is party as of the New Issue Date, and any similar agreement that
it may enter into thereafter; provided, however, that the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary of its obligations under any future amendment to the equityholders’ agreement
or under any similar agreement entered into after the New Issue Date will only be permitted under this
clause to the extent that the terms of any such amendment or new agreement are not otherwise
disadvantageous to the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect as determined in good faith by
the Issuer;

(16) any purchases by the Issuer’s Affiliates of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries the majority of which Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock is purchased by Persons
who are not the Issuer’s Affiliates; provided that such purchases by the Issuer’s Affiliates are on the same
terms as such purchases by such Persons who are not the Issuer’s Affiliates;

(17) any (a) Investments by Affiliates in securities of the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries (and
payment of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses Incurred by such Affiliates in connection therewith) so
long as the Investment is being offered by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary generally to other nonaffiliated third-party investors on the same or more favorable terms; and (b) payments to Affiliates in

(18) payments by any Parent Entity, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to any tax sharing
agreements or other equity agreements in respect of Related Taxes among any such Parent Entity, the

Controlled Investment Affiliates or Immediate Family Members) of the Issuer, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of its Parent Entities pursuant to any management equity plan or stock option plan or any other
management or employee benefit plan or agreement or any stock subscription or shareholder agreement;
and any employment agreements, stock option plans and other compensatory arrangements (and any
successor plans thereto) and any supplemental executive retirement benefit plans or arrangements with
any such employees, directors, officers, contractors or consultants (or their respective Controlled
Investment Affiliates or Immediate Family Members) that are, in each case, approved by the Issuer in
good faith;

(20) employment and severance arrangements between the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries and their
respective officers, directors, contractors, consultants, distributors and employees in the ordinary course
of business or entered into in connection with or as a result of the Transactions;

connection with or in contemplation of the disposition of assets or Capital Stock in any Restricted
Subsidiary permitted under “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or entered into with

or otherwise on customary terms for such type of arrangements in connection with similar transactions;

(22) transactions entered into by an Unrestricted Subsidiary with an Affiliate prior to the day such Unrestricted
Subsidiary is re-designated as a Restricted Subsidiary as described under “—Designation of Restricted
_and Unrestricted Subsidiaries” and pledges of Capital Stock of Unrestricted Subsidiaries;_

(23) any lease entered into between the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as lessee, and any Affiliate of the
Issuer that is not a Restricted Subsidiary, as lessor, which is approved by a majority of the members of
the Board of Directors of the Issuer;

(24) intellectual property licenses in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

(25) payments to or from, and transactions with, any joint venture in the ordinary course of business or
consistent with past practice (including any cash management activities related thereto);

(26) the payment of costs and expenses related to registration rights and customary indemnities provided to
shareholders under any shareholder agreement;

(27) any Permitted Tax Restructuring; and

(28) the existence or establishment of a fiscal unity (fiscale eenheid) for Dutch corporate income tax and/or
value added tax purposes or any analogous arrangement in any other jurisdiction of which the Issuer or
a Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a member.

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary and any Unrestricted
Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, if that designation would not cause a Default. If a Restricted
Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate fair market value of all outstanding
Investments owned by the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount
available for Restricted Payments pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments” or under one or more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Issuer._
That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted
Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

50


-----

If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as
of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer will be in default of such covenant.

If an Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated as a Restricted Subsidiary, that designation will be deemed to be an
Incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted
Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” (including pursuant to clause (5) of the second paragraph thereof,
treating such designation as an acquisition for the purpose of such clause), calculated on a pro forma basis as if
such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (2) no Default or Event of
Default would be in existence immediately following such designation. Any such designation by the Issuer or the
re-designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary to a Restricted Subsidiary as contemplated hereby shall be evidenced
to the Trustee on the date of such designation or re-designation by filing with the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate
certifying that such designation or re-designation complies with the preceding conditions.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Senior Secured Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following reports
following the New Issue Date:

(1) within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Issuer, annual reports containing: (i) the audited
consolidated balance sheet of the Issuer as at the end of the most recent two fiscal years and audited
consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Issuer for the most recent two fiscal
years, including appropriate footnotes to such financial statements, for and as at the end of such fiscal
years and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (ii) an operating and financial
review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition,
results of operations, EBITDA and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Issuer; (iii)
unaudited _pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Issuer, together with_
explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred
since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates
(unless such pro forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3)
below); provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available
without unreasonable expense, in which case the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition,
acquired company financials; (iv) a brief description of the business, management and shareholders of
the Issuer, all material affiliate transactions and a description of all material debt instruments; provided
_that the information described in clause (iv) may be provided in the footnotes to the audited financial_
statements;

(2) within 60 days following the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Issuer,
quarterly financial statements containing the following information: (i) the Issuer’s unaudited condensed
consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income
and cash flow for the most recent quarter year to date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance
sheet date and the comparable prior period, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (ii) unaudited
_pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Issuer, together with explanatory_
footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the
beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such quarterly report relates; provided
_that such_ _pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without_
unreasonable expense, in which case the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired
company financials; (iii) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements,
including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition, results of operations, EBITDA and
material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Issuer; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer announces publicly or any acquisition,
disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a change in a senior executive officer of the Issuer or a change in
auditors of the Issuer, a report containing a description of such event.

All financial statement information (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the calculations made under any
incurrence covenant, which shall be prepared in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture)

51


-----

shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or
otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may
otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3)
above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. No
report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect
to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in the Offering
Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity or business
acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Issuer’s _pro forma consolidated revenue or LTM_
EBITDA for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been delivered to
the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the
Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this “Reports”
covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the
footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries
separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by
Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC,
would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act (other than the provision of GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to
internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual
reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC
pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d).

All reports provided pursuant to this “Reports” covenant shall be in English, or with a certified English translation.

Subject to compliance with the next succeeding paragraph, in the event that, and for so long as, the equity securities
of the Issuer, STADA AG or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity are listed on the Main Market of the London Stock
Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock
Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange) and the Issuer, STADA AG or
such Parent Entity or IPO Entity is subject to the admission and disclosure standards applicable to issuers of equity
securities admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (or the equivalent standards
applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on one or more of the equivalent regulated markets
of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York
Stock Exchange), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports,
information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the London Stock
Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock
Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange) pursuant to such admission and
disclosure standards (or the applicable standards of one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of the
Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or the New York Stock
Exchange, as applicable). Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and provided that such requirements
require the Issuer, STADA AG or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual reports, information,
documents and other reports with the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, or one or more of the
equivalent regulated markets of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange, as applicable, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the
provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

The Issuer may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this covenant by
providing any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Issuer so long as such
reports (if an annual, half yearly or quarterly report) (a) meet the requirements (including as to content and time
of delivery) of this covenant as if references to the Issuer therein were references to such Parent Entity and (b)
include condensed consolidated financial information together with separate columns for: (i) such Parent Entity;
(ii) the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis; (iii) any other Subsidiaries of the Parent Entity
that are not the Issuer or Subsidiaries of the Issuer on a combined basis; (iv) consolidating adjustments; and (v)
the total consolidated amounts. Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be deemed to
have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary or the Company to, take or knowingly or
negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with
respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted
Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to
the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary or the Company to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the
Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Senior Secured Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the
Collateral, except that (i) the Issuer, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend, extend, renew,
restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any Senior Secured Security Documents for the
purposes of Incurring Permitted Collateral Liens, (ii) the Issuer, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may
amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any Senior Secured Security
Documents for the purposes of undertaking a Permitted Reorganization, (iii) the Collateral may be discharged and
released in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the applicable Senior Secured Security
Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (iv) the applicable Senior
Secured Security Documents may be amended from time to time to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect,
error or inconsistency therein and (v) the Issuer, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend the
Security Interests in any manner that does not adversely affect Holders in any material respect; provided, however,
that in the case of clause (i), (ii) and (v) above, the Senior Secured Security Documents may not be amended,
extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced pursuant to clause (i), (ii)
or (v) above, unless contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee, either (1) a
solvency opinion, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor
confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (or, in the case of any relevant action
with respect to Senior Secured Security Documents to which the Company is party as a security grantor,
confirming the solvency of the Company), after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board
of Directors of the relevant Person, in a form satisfactory to the Trustee, which confirms the solvency of the Person
granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens
created under the Senior Secured Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented,
released, modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new
hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to
such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement. In the event
that the Issuer, the Company or an applicable Restricted Subsidiary complies with the requirements of this
covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications)
consent to any amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release or other modification or
replacement requested in accordance with this covenant without the need for instructions from any Holder.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the
Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Facilities, any Credit Facility or any Public Debt, in each case of the
Issuer or a Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on the date on which the
Guarantee of such other Indebtedness is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a
supplemental indenture substantially in the form attached to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture pursuant to which
such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, which Senior Secured Notes Guarantee
will be senior to or _pari passu with, as applicable, such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other_
Indebtedness; _provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become such a_
Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee is contrary to
the Agreed Security Principles or could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations,
corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules,
guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable
jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that
is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a
partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or
obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. At the option of
the Issuer, any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent

53


-----

reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate
to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital
maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law.

Future Senior Secured Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under
“Senior Secured Notes Guarantees—Senior Secured Notes Guarantee Release.” A Senior Secured Notes
Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Issuer if at the date of such release there
is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Original Issue Date and which
could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture as at the date of such release
if such Guarantor were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall
each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, reasonably requested by, and at the cost of, the Issuer to effectuate any
release of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections
and indemnifications.

The validity and enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability
of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to
_the New Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the_
_Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may adversely affect the validity and_
_enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral” and “Certain_
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes_
_Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the
Incurrence by the Issuer, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of (x) any Indebtedness secured on Collateral
or as otherwise required herein and (y) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the
foregoing clause (x), the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter
into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) an intercreditor agreement
(an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing
Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially
less favorable to the Holders (taken as a whole)), including substantially the same terms with respect to release of
Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests; _provided that (1) such_
Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or,
in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities,
indemnities or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement and (2) if more than one such intercreditor
agreement is outstanding at any time, the correlative terms of such intercreditor agreements must not conflict.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent
of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect,
manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered
by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such
agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the
addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Senior Secured
Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(4) further secure the Senior Secured Notes (including Additional Senior Secured Notes), (5) make provision for
equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Senior Secured Notes, (6) implement any
Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in
accordance with the terms thereof or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely
affect the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect, making all necessary provisions to ensure that the
Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees are secured by first-ranking Liens over the
Collateral. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to
any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise
permitted below under “Amendments and Waivers,” and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security
Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on
the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective

54


-----

rights, duties, liabilities, indemnities or immunities under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to
the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any
obligations subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would
comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, shall
be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the
provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such
Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior
written request at our offices.

**_Limitation on Activities of the Issuer_**

The Issuer shall not carry on any business or own any material assets other than:

(1) the Incurrence, Guarantee, offering, sale, issuance and servicing, listing, purchase, redemption,
exchange, refinancing or retirement of Indebtedness (and guarantees thereof, including the Guarantees
of the 2017 Senior Notes) permitted by the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or performance
of the terms and conditions of such Indebtedness, to the extent such activities are otherwise permissible
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, and the granting of any Liens permitted pursuant to the
covenant described above under the caption “—Limitation on Liens”;

(2) (i) rights and obligations arising under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Existing Notes Indenture,

the Senior Secured Security Documents or any other agreement of the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries existing on the New Issue Date or to which it is or becomes a party or (ii) undertaken with

such contribution is not prohibited by the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(4) making Investments in the Senior Secured Notes (including any Additional Senior Secured Notes) or any
other Indebtedness to the extent such Investment is not prohibited by the terms of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture;

(5) (i) involving the provision of administrative, managerial, legal, treasury (including those related to
overhead costs, paying filing fees and other ordinary course expenses (such as audit fees and Taxes),
treasury services and cash pooling arrangements) and accounting services as to itself and as to its
Subsidiaries of a type customarily provided by a holding company to its Subsidiaries as to itself and the
receipt of any amounts related thereto and (ii) the fulfilment of any periodic reporting requirements;

(6) related or reasonably incidental to the establishment and/or maintenance of its and its Subsidiaries’
corporate existence;

(7) the making or receipt (i) of any Restricted Payment, Permitted Payment or Permitted Investment
permitted by the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, (ii) any Asset Disposition permitted by

members of management thereof and any related corporate entity established for such purpose);

(11) pursuant to or in connection with the Transactions and any step or action taken (or relating to a step or
action taken) by the Issuer in relation thereto prior to the New Issue Date or pursuant to or in connection
with any Permitted Holdco Transaction or Permitted Reorganization; or

(12) other activities not specifically enumerated above that are ancillary or de minimis in nature.

**Merger and Consolidation**

**_The Issuer_**

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer or lease or otherwise dispose
of all or substantially all of its assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Issuer”) will be a Person organized and
existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union, or the United States of America,
any State of the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway
or Switzerland and the Successor Issuer (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume, by supplemental
indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Senior Secured
Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and all obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Security Documents, as
applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the applicable Successor Issuer or any Subsidiary of the applicable Successor Issuer as a
result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the applicable Successor Issuer or such Subsidiary
at the time of such transaction), no Default has occurred and is continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Issuer or the applicable Successor Issuer
would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the
covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries would not be lower than it was immediately
prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer or the Successor Issuer, as the case may be, shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and
such supplemental indenture (in the case of a Successor Issuer) comply with the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (in the case of a
Successor Issuer) is a legal and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Issuer, provided
_that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of_
fact, including as to satisfaction of clauses (1), (2) and (3) above.

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Issuer
under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, but in a case of a lease of all or
substantially all of its assets, the predecessor Person will not be released from its obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes.

**_Guarantors_**

56


-----

No Guarantor may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person; or

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets, in one transaction or a
series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into such Guarantor, unless:

(A) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or
becomes a Guarantor substantially concurrently with such transaction;

(B) (1) either (x) the Issuer or another Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the
resulting, surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the
Guarantor under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee and the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
the Senior Secured Security Documents, as applicable and (2) immediately after giving
effect to such transaction, no Default has occurred and is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of
consolidation or merger) of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or
substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise not prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

The provisions set forth in this “Merger and Consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply to):
(i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating into or
transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (ii) any Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part
of its properties and assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor; (iii) any consolidation or merger of the Issuer into
any Guarantor; provided that (A) if the Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the
relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured
Security Documents and clauses (1) and (4) under the heading “—The Issuer” shall apply to such transaction; and
(B) to the extent that any Security Interest previously granted over the shares in the capital of the relevant
Guarantor would not, in accordance with applicable law, constitute a Lien over the shares in the capital of the
surviving entity, the direct holding company of the relevant surviving entity shall, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, grant a Security Interest over the shares in the capital of such surviving entity on substantially
equivalent terms to any Security Interest granted over the shares in the capital of such predecessor Guarantor
immediately prior to such merger or consolidation; or (iv) the Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into or
merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile
of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity;
_provided, however, that clauses (1), (2) and (4) under the heading “—The Issuer” or clause (3) under this heading_
“Guarantors,” as the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction; or (v) any Permitted Holdco Transaction.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph under the heading “—
_The Issuer”) shall not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary. Notwithstanding the_
foregoing, the Transactions and any Permitted Holdco Transactions will be permitted without compliance with
this section.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Senior Secured Note when due and payable, continued for 30
days;

57


-----

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior Secured Note when
due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or
otherwise;

of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior
Secured Notes with any agreement or obligation contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(4) the occurrence of any default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be
issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the
Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the
latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries) would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary) (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any
Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary)) other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether
such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date hereof, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after
giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (“payment
_default”); or_

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the “cross
_acceleration provision”),_

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other
such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default of principal at its stated final maturity (after
giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates €50.0
million or more at any time outstanding;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary (or
group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial
statements for the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) (the
“bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary (or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together
(as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries)
would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of €50.0 million
other than any judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies issued by, reputable
and creditworthy companies, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a
period of more than 60 days (after receipt of notice as described in the next succeeding paragraph) after
such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement
proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly
stayed (the “judgment default provision”);

(7) any Security Interest under the Senior Secured Security Documents having a fair market value in excess
of €20.0 million shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the
terms of the relevant Senior Secured Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) for any reason other than the
satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the release of any such
Security Interest in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Senior Secured Security Documents or any
such Security Interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such Security Interest is invalid or unenforceable
and any such Default continues for 10 days; and

(8) except as permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including with respect to any limitations), any Senior Secured Notes
Guarantee of a Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Guarantors that, taken together
(as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries)

58


-----

would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) is held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or
invalid or ceases for any reason to be in full force and effect, or any Guarantor that is a Significant
Subsidiary (or any group of Guarantors that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial
statements for the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary), or
any Person acting on behalf of any such Guarantor or Guarantors, denies or disaffirms its obligations
under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee.

However, a Default under clauses (4) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the
Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes
notify the Issuer of the Default and, with respect to clauses (4) and (6), the Issuer does not cure such Default
within 60 days after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the
Trustee by written notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Senior Secured Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee may, and the Trustee (subject to
certain conditions) at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, on all the Senior Secured Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of
the Senior Secured Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “Events of Default” has
occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes shall be automatically
annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be
remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event
of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration
with respect thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes would not conflict with
any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Issuer occurs and is continuing, the
principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Senior Secured Notes will become and be
immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Holders may not enforce the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes except as provided in
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and may not enforce the Senior Secured Security Documents except as
provided in such Senior Secured Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment
of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Senior Secured Note held by a nonconsenting Holder, which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such
Senior Secured Notes and its consequences (including the payment default that resulted from such acceleration)
if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a
required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial
Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with
another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and
(ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant
entitled “Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other
provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report
required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the
prescribed period specified in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee
indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense.
Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy
with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

59


-----

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have requested in
writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or indemnity
satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and
the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have not given
the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within
such 60 day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured
Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required
in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own
affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would
involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the
Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against
all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is
informed in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders
within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or
premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the
Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s
Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The
Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events
of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or
proposes to take in respect thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Secured Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for,
Senior Secured Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof
may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured
Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange
offer for, Senior Secured Notes). However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the
case of clause (9) below, 75%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, an
amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Senior Secured Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Senior Secured
Note (other than provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(2) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Senior Secured Note (other than
provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(3) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Senior Secured Note or change the time at
which any such Senior Secured Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “Optional
_Redemption” or “Redemption for Taxation Reasons”;_

60


-----

(4) make any such Senior Secured Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Senior Secured
Note;

(5) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of, or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes on or after the due dates
therefor;

(6) make any change in the provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture described under “Withholding
_Taxes” that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Secured Notes in any material respect_
or amends the terms of such Senior Secured Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption
from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct
Taxes so described thereunder unless the applicable Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in
respect thereof;

(7) release all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral
(taken as a whole) other than in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Security Documents,
the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture; _provided that, for the avoidance of doubt and without prejudice to the covenant_
described under the heading “Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,” the release of less
than all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral (taken
as a whole) shall only require the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default
or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained
in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes);

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the non-payment of principal, premium or interest or
Additional Amounts, if any (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes
by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes and a waiver of
the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(9) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and
the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(10) reduce the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes whose holders must consent to any amendment,
waiver or modification or make any other change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require
the Holders’ consent described in this sentence.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with, the covenants
described under “Certain Covenants” shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of Holders to receive payment
of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee and the other parties
thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Senior Secured Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or a Guarantor under
any Senior Secured Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any right or
power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or make
any change (including changing the ISIN or other identifying number on any Senior Secured Notes) that
does not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee or any Holder in any material respect;

61


-----

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member
of senior management of the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Senior Secured Notes that may be
issued in compliance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(6) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenant described
under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “Certain Covenants—Additional
_Guarantees,” to add Senior Secured Notes Guarantees with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, to add_
security to or for the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release,
termination, discharge or retaking of any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Lien with respect to or
securing the Senior Secured Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is provided for
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Security Documents or
the Senior Secured Notes to any provision of this “Description of the New Notes” to the extent that such
provision in this “Description of the New Notes” was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision
of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Security Documents or the Senior Secured
Notes;

(8) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee pursuant
to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee to any Senior Secured Notes
Document;

(9) in the case of the Senior Secured Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a
Security Interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Senior
Facilities, in any property which is required by the Senior Secured Security Documents or the Senior
Facilities (as in effect on the New Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a
Security Interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a
Security Interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such Security
Interest is not prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Impairment
_of Security Interest” is complied with;_

(10) make any amendment to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the transfer and
legending of Senior Secured Notes as permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including to
facilitate the issuance and administration of Senior Secured Notes; provided, however, that (i) compliance
with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture as so amended would not result in Senior Secured Notes being
transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities law and (ii) such
amendment does not adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Senior Secured Notes in any
material respect;

(11) facilitate any transaction that complies with the covenants described under the headings “Merger and
_Consolidation” and “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” relating to_
mergers, consolidations and sales of assets; or

(12) as provided in “Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such
evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to approve the particular
form of any proposed amendment of any Senior Secured Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves
the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture by any Holder of Senior Secured Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Senior
Secured Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not contain
a covenant regulating the offer and/or payment of a consent fee to Holders.

62


-----

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Senior Secured
Notes Documents (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then-existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for
certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities
and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning
issuing temporary Senior Secured Notes, registrations of Senior Secured Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Senior Secured Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments
held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Senior Secured
Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance
trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate the obligations of it and the Restricted Subsidiaries under the covenants
described under “Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1), (2) and (4) of “Merger and Consolidation—The
_Issuer”) and “Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under “Events_
_of Default” above, the operation of the cross default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions,_
the bankruptcy provisions (other than with respect to the Issuer), the judgment default provision, the guarantee
provision and the security default provisions described under “Events of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of
its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Senior Secured
Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. If the
Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, payment of the Senior
Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than clauses
(1), (2) and (4) of “Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”), (4), (5) (with respect only to the Issuer and
Significant Subsidiaries (or a group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary) of the Issuer), (6), (7) or (8) under “Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”)
with the Trustee cash in Euros or European Government Obligations or a combination thereof for the payment of
principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Secured Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may
be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that Holders, in
their capacity as Holders, will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes
as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same
amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and
defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be
based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income tax
law since the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating,
hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating
to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Security Documents will be
discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of transfer or exchange of the Senior
Secured Notes and rights of the Trustee, as expressly provided for in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) as to
all Senior Secured Notes when (1) either (a) all the Senior Secured Notes previously authenticated and delivered
(other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Senior Secured Notes and certain Senior Secured Notes for which
provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Senior Secured Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee
for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within

63


-----

one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for
the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has
deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee, money in Euros or European Government Obligations, or a
combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the
Senior Secured Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and
interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Senior Secured Notes that have become due and payable), or to the
Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums
payable under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the
Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Senior
Secured Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the
Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent under the
“Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the satisfaction and
discharge of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may
rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1),
(2) and (3)). If requested in writing by the Issuer, the Trustee may distribute any amounts deposited to the Holders
prior to Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be; provided, however, that the Holders shall have
received at least three Business Days’ notice from the Issuer of such earlier repayment date (which may be
included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior
to the maturity or redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value
adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of its respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Senior
Secured Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their
creation. Each Holder by accepting a Senior Secured Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and
release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior Secured Notes. Such waiver may not be effective
to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against
public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The Senior
Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a
responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set
forth specifically in such Senior Secured Notes Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default of which a
responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and
powers vested in it under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent
Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking
any action enumerated in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become
a creditor of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in
respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions
with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed and
replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders
of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes, or may resign at any time by giving
written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is
not eliminated, (b) fails to meet certain minimum limits regarding the aggregate of its capital and surplus or (c)
becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee,
or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal
of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Trustee.

64


-----

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,
liability, taxes and expenses Incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or
in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**Notices**

If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the
extent that the rules of the Authority so require, notices of the Issuer with respect to the Senior Secured Notes will
be sent to the Authority.

All notices to Holders will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their respective
addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. For so long as any Senior Secured
Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream in
accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, delivery of which shall be deemed to
satisfy the requirements of this paragraph, which will give such notices to the Holders of Book-Entry Interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than
once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so
mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or
other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed.
Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect
to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether
or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or communication is given in via Euroclear or Clearstream, it is duly
given on the day the notice is given to Euroclear or Clearstream.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or Additional Amounts,
if any, on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof.
Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be
prescribed six years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro Denominated Restrictions**

Euro will be the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Guarantors under
or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, including damages.
Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than Euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a
judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Guarantor or
otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a
Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the Euro
amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on
the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date
on which it is practicable to do so).

If that Euro amount is less than the Euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any
Senior Secured Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such
recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the
Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency
indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Senior Secured
Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of
information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and
independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and
independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Senior Secured Note
or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect
despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any
Senior Secured Note or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any Eurodenominated restriction herein, the Euro equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a non-Euro
currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such non-Euro
amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

65

**Listing**

Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Senior Secured Notes on
the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the application to list the Senior Secured Notes on the Exchange
will be approved, that permission to deal in the Senior Secured Notes thereon will be granted or that such listing

or issues or redeems Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock subsequent to the commencement of the reference
period but prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
is made (the “Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date”), then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be
calculated giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence, deemed Incurrence, assumption, Guarantee, redemption,
defeasance, retirement, extinguishment or other discharge of Indebtedness, or such issuance or redemption of
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four quarter
period; provided, however, that the pro forma calculation shall not give effect to: (i) any Fixed Charges attributable
to Indebtedness Incurred on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date pursuant to the provisions
described in the second paragraph under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” (other than Fixed
Charges attributable to Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clauses (1)(c), (1)(d) and (5)(b) thereof); (ii) Fixed

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, any Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers,
amalgamations, consolidations and disposed operations that have been made by the Issuer or any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries, during the reference period or subsequent to the reference period and on or prior to or simultaneously
with the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all
such Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and disposed or
discontinued operations (and the change in any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in LTM
EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the reference period. If since the beginning of such
period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged or amalgamated with or into
the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period shall have made any Investment,
acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or disposed or discontinued operation that would
have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated
giving _pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger,_

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction, the pro forma calculations
shall be made in good faith by a responsible financial or chief accounting officer of the Issuer (and may include
cost savings and synergies). If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma
effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire reference period (taking into account any
Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed
to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer to
be the rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with IFRS. For purposes of

81


-----

making the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed
with a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the
reference period except as set forth in the first paragraph of this definition. Interest on Indebtedness that may
optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank
offered rate, or other rate, shall be determined to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or if none, then
based upon such optional rate chosen as the Issuer may designate.

deemed to be Incurred by such Restricted Subsidiary at the time it becomes a Restricted Subsidiary and the terms
“Incurred” and “Incurrence” have meanings correlative to the foregoing and any Indebtedness pursuant to any

###### THE EXCHANGE OFFERS

**General**

The Issuer is offering to Eligible Holders to exchange up to the Maximum Acceptance Amount of its issued and
outstanding Existing Notes for New Notes, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Exchange
Offer Memorandum. Subject to the Maximum Acceptance Amount, the aggregate principal amount of each Series
of Existing Notes that is exchanged on the Settlement Date will be based on the Acceptance Priority Levels (as
defined below).

Electronic instruction notices will be accepted only in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The New Notes will only be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000
and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer reserves the right to reject or adjust any electronic
instruction notice that would result in an issuance of New Notes with a principal amount of less than €100,000 or
not in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof; no cash will be paid in lieu of any principal amount of New
Notes not received as a result of rounding down. Eligible Holders who do not offer all of their Existing Notes for
exchange should ensure they retain a principal amount of Existing Notes amounting to at least the applicable
required minimum denomination.

As of the date of this Exchange Offer Memorandum, an aggregate principal amount of €1,885,000,000 of Existing
Notes were outstanding.

**Total Consideration**

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Exchange Offers, for each €1,000 principal amount of Existing
Notes validly offered for exchange (and not validly withdrawn) at or prior to the Expiration Time and that are
accepted in the Exchange Offers, Eligible Holders will receive:

- €1,000 aggregate principal amount of New Notes (the “Exchange Consideration”); and

- a cash payment in an amount equal to €80 (the “Cash Consideration” and, together with the Exchange
Consideration, the “Total Consideration”).

The Issuer reserves the right to reject, round up or round down any electronic instruction notice that would result
in an issuance of New Notes with a principal amount of less than €100,000 or not in integral multiples of €1,000
in excess thereof.

Existing Notes that are accepted for exchange in the Exchange Offers will be cancelled by the Issuer.

**Accrued and Unpaid Interest**

In addition to the Total Consideration, Eligible Holders whose Existing Notes are validly offered for exchange
(and not validly withdrawn) and accepted for exchange pursuant to the Exchange Offers will also be paid in cash
the accrued and unpaid interest on such Existing Notes from, and including, the last interest payment date for such
Existing Notes preceding the Settlement Date (September 30, 2022) to, but not including, the Settlement Date.

Eligible Holders who do not exchange will continue to be paid interest according to the terms of the Existing
Notes.

**Maximum Acceptance Amount**

Subject to the Minimum Condition of €500,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of New Notes to be issued in
the Exchange Offers and applicable law, the Exchange Offers may be amended, extended, terminated or
withdrawn with respect to any or all Series of Existing Notes. The Existing Notes accepted for exchange on the
Settlement Date will be accepted in accordance with their respective Acceptance Priority Levels set forth on the
front cover page of this Exchange Offer Memorandum (with 1 being the highest Acceptance Priority Level),
provided that the Issuer will only accept for exchange an aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes that will
not result in the aggregate purchase price (excluding accrued and unpaid interest) of such New Notes exceeding
the Maximum Acceptance Amount. For more information, please see “—Acceptance Priority Levels; Maximum
_Acceptance Amount; Proration” below. As a result, each Eligible Holder who validly offers (and does not validly_
withdraw) Existing Notes for exchange pursuant to the Exchange Offers may have a portion of its Existing Notes
returned to it, and the amount of Existing Notes returned will depend on the level of participation of Eligible

107


-----

Holders in the Exchange Offers. The Exchange Offers may be subject to proration if the aggregate principal
amount (excluding accrued and unpaid interest) of the Existing Notes that are validly offered for exchange (and
not validly withdrawn) is greater than the Maximum Acceptance Amount. For more information, please see “—
_Acceptance Priority Levels; Maximum Acceptance Amount; Proration” below._

The consummation of an Exchange Offer with respect to a Series of Existing Notes is not conditioned on the
consummation of any other Exchange Offer with respect to the other Series of Existing Notes. Each Exchange
Offer is independent of the other Exchange Offers, and the Issuer may, subject to applicable law, withdraw or
modify any Exchange Offers without withdrawing or modifying the other Exchange Offers.

**Acceptance Priority Levels; Maximum Acceptance Amount; Proration**

Subject to the Maximum Acceptance Amount, the Existing Notes validly offered for exchange (and not validly
withdrawn) and accepted for exchange on the Settlement Date will be accepted in accordance with their respective
Acceptance Priority Levels set forth on the front cover page of this Exchange Offer Memorandum (with 1 being
the highest Acceptance Priority Level) (the “Acceptance Priority Levels”).

The Maximum Acceptance Amount limits the combined aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes that may
be exchanged in the Exchange Offers to an amount to be determined in the sole discretion of the Issuer and to be
announced on the Announcement Date.

The Exchange Offers may be subject to proration if the aggregate principal amount (excluding accrued and unpaid
interest) of the Existing Notes that are validly offered for exchange (and not validly withdrawn) is greater than
the Maximum Acceptance Amount. In accordance with, and in order of, the Acceptance Priority Levels, the
Existing Notes of the Series the acceptance of which would result in the Maximum Acceptance Amount being
exceeded will be accepted on a pro rata basis, based on a proration factor selected so as to accept the maximum
principal amount of Existing Notes of such Series that will not result in the aggregate principal amount (excluding
accrued and unpaid interest) of the Existing Notes accepted for exchange exceeding the Maximum Acceptance
Amount (and no Existing Notes validly offered for exchange (and not validly withdrawn) of a Series with a lower
Acceptance Priority Level than such Series subject to such proration will be accepted for exchange). If proration
of validly offered for exchange (and not validly withdrawn) Existing Notes of a Series is required, the Issuer will
determine the final proration factor applicable to such Series as soon as practicable after the Expiration Time and
will announce the results of proration by press release. The Issuer will accept for exchange validly offered for
exchange (and not validly withdrawn) Existing Notes of the relevant Series on a prorated basis, with the aggregate
principal amount of each Eligible Holder’s validly offered for exchange (and not validly withdrawn) Existing
Notes of such Series accepted for exchange determined by multiplying each Eligible Holder’s offer of Existing
Notes of such Series for exchange by the applicable proration factor, and rounding the product down to the nearest
€1,000 principal amount. Proration will be subject to maintaining €100,000 minimum denominations (and integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof) of each Series of the Existing Notes. If the principal amount of Existing
Notes of the relevant Series that are validly offered for exchange (and not validly withdrawn) but accepted for
exchange and returned to the applicable Eligible Holder as a result of proration would result in less than the
minimum denomination being returned to the applicable Eligible Holder, the Issuer will either accept at least the
minimum denomination or reject all of such Eligible Holder’s validly offered for exchange (and not validly
withdrawn) Existing Notes of such Series. Any amount of Existing Notes to be returned to an Eligible Holder on
account of proration, will continue to remain blocked until the Settlement Date.

Assuming there has been no amendment to the terms of the Exchange Offer and the satisfaction of the
€500,000,000 Minimum Condition and in accordance with the Acceptance Priority Levels, any Mirror Notes
offered for exchange and accepted by the Issuer will not be subject to proration in the event that the aggregate
principal amount of Existing Notes offered for exchange and accepted by the Issuer exceeds the Maximum
Acceptance Amount.

**Expiration Time; Extensions; Amendments**

The Expiration Time for the Exchange Offers is 4:00 P.M., London time, on October 19, 2022, subject to the
Issuer’s right to extend such date and time for the Exchange Offers, in which case, the last expiration time shall
mean the latest date and time to which the Exchange Offers are extended. If the Issuer decides to extend the
Expiration Time or re-open the Exchange Offers, the Issuer will announce any extensions or re-openings by press
release or other permitted means no later than 8:00 a.m. London time on the first Business Day immediately
following the previously scheduled Expiration Time. The Issuer may extend the Expiration Time in its sole and

108


-----

absolute discretion, for any purpose including, without limitation, to permit the satisfaction or waiver of any or
all conditions to the Exchange Offers.

The Issuer expressly reserves the right, subject to applicable law, (i) to delay acceptance of any validly offered
for exchange (and not validly withdrawn) Existing Notes, to extend the Expiration Time, or to terminate the
Exchange Offers and not accept any validly offered for exchange (and not validly withdrawn) Existing Notes if
any of the conditions set forth under “—Settlement Conditions” shall not have been waived or satisfied prior to
the Expiration Time and (ii) to amend at any time, or from time to time, the terms of the Exchange Offers. If the
Issuer exercises any such right, it will give oral or written notice thereof to the Exchange and Tabulation Agent
as promptly as practicable. Without limiting the manner in which the Issuer may choose to make a public
announcement of any delay, extension, amendment or termination of the Exchange Offers, the Issuer will comply
with applicable securities laws by disclosing any such amendment by means of an Exchange Offer Memorandum
supplement that is distributed to Eligible Holders. The Issuer will have no other obligation to publish, advertise
or otherwise communicate any such public announcement other than by making a timely release through the
Clearing Systems and/or any appropriate news agency.

During any extension, re-opening or amendment of an Exchange Offer, all Existing Notes previously offered for
exchange in the Exchange Offer will remain subject to such Exchange Offer and may, subject to the terms and
conditions of the Exchange Offer and applicable law, be accepted by the Issuer. Any waiver, amendment,
modification or termination of an Exchange Offer will apply to all Existing Notes of the Series subject to such
Exchange Offer and offered for exchange pursuant to the Exchange Offer. If the Issuer makes a change that the
Issuer determines to be material to any of the terms of an Exchange Offer or waives a condition of an Exchange
Offer that the Issuer determines to be material, the Issuer will give written notice of such amendment or waiver to
the Exchange and Tabulation Agent and will announce such changes by press release through the Clearing
Systems as promptly as possible and extend the Exchange Offer for so long as the Issuer determines necessary
and to the extent required by law.

Only Eligible Holders are authorized to participate in the Exchange Offers.

Eligible Holders may participate in the Exchange Offers prior to the Expiration Time by validly submitting an
Exchange Instruction (and not delivering a Withdrawal Notice) in compliance with the requirements established
by the relevant Clearing System. Participating Holders that validly submit an Exchange Instruction prior to the
Expiration Time may validly withdraw their validly offered for exchange Existing Notes by submitting a
Withdrawal Notice prior to the Expiration Time. Following the Expiration Time, validly offered for exchange
(and not validly withdrawn) Existing Notes can no longer be withdrawn, subject to applicable law. By submitting
an Exchange Instruction, an Eligible Holder agrees that validly offered for exchange (and not validly withdrawn)
Existing Notes may not be withdrawn after the Expiration Time subject to applicable law. All questions as to
validity, form and eligibility (including time of receipt) of any Exchange Instruction will be determined in the sole
and absolute discretion of the Issuer. Such determination as to whether or when an Exchange Instruction is
received, whether it is duly completed and signed or whether an offer for Existing Notes for exchange is validly
withdrawn shall be final and binding.

**Settlement Conditions**

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Exchange Offer Memorandum, the Issuer will not be required to
accept for exchange any Existing Notes validly offered for exchange (and not validly withdrawn) and may instead
cancel the Exchange Offers. The settlement of the Exchange Offers on the Settlement Date is conditional upon
the satisfaction (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) of the following Settlement Conditions, which may

Memorandum;

109

counterclaim or investigation (whether formal or informal) (or there shall not have been any material
adverse development to any action, application, claim, counterclaim or proceeding currently instituted,
threatened or pending) before or by any court, governmental, regulatory or administrative agency or
instrumentality, domestic or foreign, or by any other person, domestic or foreign, in connection with the
Exchange Offers or any declaration of default or event of default in connection with any of the Group’s
material credit instruments, in each case that either (i) is, or is reasonably likely to be, materially adverse
to the Group’s or the Issuer’s business, operations, properties, condition (financial or otherwise), income,
assets, liabilities or prospects, (ii) would or might prohibit, prevent, restrict or delay consummation of the
Exchange Offers, or (iii) would materially impair the contemplated benefits of the Exchange Offers to the

or otherwise), income, assets, liabilities or prospects, (ii) would or might prohibit, prevent, restrict or delay
consummation of the Exchange Offers, (iii) would materially impair the contemplated benefits of the

instruments; and

(h) there does not exist, in the Issuer’s sole discretion, any actual or threatened legal impediment to the
acceptance for exchange of, or the actual exchange of, any validly offered for exchange (and not validly
withdrawn) Existing Notes, or any actual or potential violation of law in connection with the Exchange
Offers.

**Existing Notes for New Notes in circumstances that may otherwise be invalid. Such circumstances may**
**include, for example, if Exchange Instructions are not in proper form or if the Exchange Offers do not**

the Issuer will disclose such material change by means of an Exchange Offer Memorandum supplement or a press

**Procedures for Participating in the Exchange Offers**

**_General_**

The Issuer is not soliciting any offers of Existing Notes for exchange pursuant to the Exchange Offers from any
Noteholders in any jurisdiction in which offering Existing Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offers would not be in
compliance with the laws of such jurisdiction. Each Noteholder who comes into possession of this Exchange Offer
Memorandum must inform itself about and comply with all applicable laws and regulations in force in any
jurisdiction in which it holds Existing Notes.

The following procedures apply to Existing Notes which are held in the account of a Direct Participant in the
relevant Clearing Systems. Eligible Holders are advised to read the following information carefully.

Only Direct Participants may submit Exchange Instructions to the relevant Clearing Systems. Each Eligible
Holder that is not a Direct Participant must arrange for the Direct Participant through which it holds the relevant
Existing Notes to submit an Exchange Instruction on its behalf to the relevant Clearing System by the deadlines
specified by such Clearing System.

110


-----

Eligible Holders are advised to check with any bank, securities broker or other intermediary through which they
hold Existing Notes as to when such intermediary would need to receive instructions from an Eligible Holder in
order for such Eligible Holder to be able to participate in, or revoke its instruction to participate in, the Exchange
Offers before the deadlines specified in this Exchange Offer Memorandum. The deadlines set by any such
intermediary and the relevant Clearing System for the submission of Exchange Instructions may be earlier than
the relevant deadlines specified in this Exchange Offer Memorandum.

Direct Participants must submit Exchange Instructions in accordance with the procedures established by the
relevant Clearing System. Direct Participants should refer to the respective notifications (including, in particular,
the Clearing System Notices) that Direct Participants receive from the Clearing Systems for detailed information
regarding participation procedures, which may include certain special procedures, and should contact the relevant
Clearing System with respect to questions as to the requirements for the submission of Exchange Instructions to
that Clearing System.

By submitting Exchange Instructions on behalf of an Eligible Holder, each Direct Participant will be deemed to
have consented to the relevant Clearing System providing any details set forth in such Exchange Instruction to the
Exchange and Tabulation Agent (and to the Exchange and Tabulation Agent providing such details to the Issuer
and the Trustee and their respective legal and other advisers).

Eligible Holders that need assistance with respect to the procedures for participating in the Exchange Offers should
contact the Exchange and Tabulation Agent, the contact details for which are on the back cover of this Exchange
Offer Memorandum.

**_Exchange Instructions_**

Only Eligible Holders may participate in the Exchange Offers. An Eligible Holder that wishes to offer its Existing
Notes for exchange must deliver an Exchange Instruction. Only Direct Participants may submit Exchange
Instructions to the Clearing Systems.

Each Exchange Instruction must include, in addition to any information required by the relevant Clearing System:

- the principal amount of the Existing Notes to which such Exchange Instruction relates (only offers of Existing
Notes for exchange in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof
will be accepted); and/or

- the name of the Direct Participant and the securities account number for the relevant Clearing System in
which the Existing Notes are held; and

- the name, telephone number and email address of the beneficial owner of the Existing Notes to which such
Exchange Instruction relates.

If the Eligible Holder is not a Direct Participant, the Eligible Holder (or a financial institution or other intermediary
on its behalf) must procure that the Direct Participant through which it holds the Existing Notes submits an
Exchange Instruction. The receipt of an Exchange Instruction by the relevant Clearing System will be
acknowledged by such Clearing System in accordance with the procedures laid out in the Clearing System Notice
of that Clearing System and will result in the blocking of the Existing Notes represented by such Exchange
Instruction until the Settlement Date. Each Eligible Holder that submits an Exchange Instruction must take the
appropriate steps through the relevant Clearing System necessary to ensure that no transfers can be effected in
relation to such blocked Existing Notes in accordance with the requirements of the relevant Clearing System and
the deadlines required by such Clearing System.

None of the Issuer, the Dealer Managers, the Exchange and Tabulation Agent or the Trustee (or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates or advisers) will be responsible for ensuring that any
Exchange Instruction is submitted to or accepted by a Clearing System or for ensuring that the Clearing System
submits any Exchange Instruction, as applicable, to the Exchange and Tabulation Agent by the Expiration Time.
If (i) the Exchange Instruction of any Eligible Holder is not submitted by the relevant Clearing System to the
Exchange and Tabulation Agent on or before the Expiration Time, or (ii) the Eligible Holder, or a Direct
Participant or custodian on behalf of such Eligible Holder, does not submit any other required documents in
connection with such submission, in each case on or before the applicable deadline, the Issuer reserves the absolute
right to (a) reject the relevant Exchange Instruction, (b) require that any errors or defects in the relevant Exchange

111


-----

Instruction be remedied, or (c) waive any such errors or defects and accept the relevant Exchange Instruction. In
any such case, the rules, procedures and regulations of the relevant Clearing System will apply.

By submitting an Exchange Instruction, Participating Holders shall be deemed to have made the agreements,
acknowledgements, representations, warranties and undertakings set forth below under “—Eligible Holders’
_Agreements, Acknowledgements, Representations, Warranties and Undertakings—Participating Holders”, to the_
Issuer and the Exchange and Tabulation Agent at (i) the Expiration Time and (ii) at the time of settlement on the
Settlement Date, as applicable.

**Withdrawal of Validly Offered for Exchange Existing Notes**

If the Company makes changes to the terms of any Exchange Offer, which in the opinion of the Company (in
consultation with the Lead Dealer Managers), would be materially prejudicial to those Eligible Holders who may
have already validly offered their Existing Notes by submitting a valid Exchange Instruction, the Company will
disseminate an Exchange Offer Memorandum supplement or a press release (at the option of the Issuer) and will
extend the Exchange Offers to the extent required by applicable law in order to permit Eligible Holders adequate
time to consider these materials, and in certain circumstances, to permit Noteholders to revoke or withdraw their
offers of Existing Notes for exchange. Validly submitted offers of Existing Notes for exchange may be withdrawn
by providing a notice of withdrawal (a “Withdrawal Notice”) following the procedures described herein.

By offering its Existing Notes for exchange, an Eligible Holder agrees that its offers of Existing Notes for
exchange may not be withdrawn, except as described herein.

For a withdrawal to be effective, Eligible Holders must submit a Withdrawal Notice. Only Direct Participants may
submit a Withdrawal Notice to the relevant Clearing Systems.

Such Withdrawal Notice must include, in addition to any information required by the relevant Clearing System:

- the principal amount of the validly offered for exchange Existing Notes to which such Withdrawal Notice
relates;

- the name of the Direct Participant and the securities account number for the relevant Clearing System to
which the withdrawn Existing Notes can be credited; and

- the name, telephone number and email address of the beneficial owner of the Existing Notes to which such
Withdrawal Notice relates.

Withdrawals of offers of Existing Notes for exchange may not be rescinded and any Existing Notes withdrawn
will thereafter be deemed not validly offered for exchange for purposes of the Exchange Offers. Properly
withdrawn Existing Notes, however, may be re-offered for exchange by following the procedures described above
at any time prior to the Expiration Time.

**Irregularities**

All questions as to the validity, form and eligibility (including times of receipt) of any Exchange Instruction will
be determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion, which determination shall be final and binding.

The Issuer reserves the absolute right to reject any and all Exchange Instructions not in proper form or for which
any corresponding agreement by the Issuer to accept would, in the opinion of the Issuer and its legal advisers, be
unlawful. The Issuer also reserves the absolute right to waive any defects, irregularities or delay in the submission
of any and all Exchange Instructions in their sole discretion. The Issuer also reserves the absolute right to waive
any such defect, irregularity or delay in respect of particular Exchange Instructions whether or not the Issuer elects
to waive similar defects, irregularities or any delay in respect of any other such Exchange Instructions.

Any defect, irregularity or delay must be cured within such time as the Issuer determines, unless waived by it.
Exchange Instructions will be deemed not to have been or submitted until such defects, irregularities or delays
have been cured or waived. None of the Issuer, the Dealer Managers, the Exchange and Tabulation Agent or the
Trustee (or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates or advisers) shall be under any
duty to give notice to an Eligible Holder of any defects, irregularities or delays in any Exchange Instruction, nor
shall any of them incur any liability for failing to give such notice.

**Amendment and Termination of the Exchange Offers**

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Exchange Offers, the Issuer may, subject to applicable laws, at its
option and in its discretion, at any time and in relation to any or all Exchange Offers:

(a) (x) extend the Expiration Time or the Settlement Date or (y) re-open the Exchange Offers;

(b) otherwise extend, re-open or amend the Exchange Offers in any respect with or without extending the
Expiration Time;

(c) delay the exchange of validly offered for exchange (and not validly withdrawn) Existing Notes accepted
for exchange in the Exchange Offers until satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by law) of the
Settlement Conditions;

(d) terminate the Exchange Offers, including with respect to Exchange Instructions, submitted before the time
of such termination; or

(e) withdraw the Exchange Offers from any one or more jurisdictions.

In addition, the Issuer reserves the right to agree to extend or delay the Settlement Date, to terminate the Exchange
Offers or to modify the settlement procedures in any way and at any time if:

(i) any court order or judgment is issued, or any legal proceedings are commenced, with the purpose or
effect of preventing or impeding the exchange, transfer or cancellation of the Existing Notes, or
enjoining delivery of the New Notes or impeding or attaching payments under the New Notes; or

(ii) the Issuer, in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted by applicable laws, rules and regulations,
determines that such extension, delay, termination or modification is in the best interests of the Issuer
or the Eligible Holders seeking to participate in the Exchange Offers, in light of any court order,
judgment or pending administrative, litigation, arbitral or other legal proceedings against the Issuer.

If the Issuer decides to extend the Expiration Time or re-open the Exchange Offers, the Issuer will announce any
extensions or re-opening as soon as is reasonably practicable after the relevant decision is made, but in no event
later than 8 a.m. London Time on the Business Day immediately following the previously scheduled Expiration
Time. See “—Method of Announcement”. If the Exchange Offers are amended in a manner determined by the
Issuer to constitute a material change, it will promptly disclose such amendment in a manner reasonably calculated
to inform the Eligible Holders of such amendment and, in the Issuer’s sole discretion, subject to applicable law,
the Issuer may extend the Expiration Time to permit the satisfaction or waiver of any or all conditions to the
Exchange Offers.

**Announcement Date**

As soon as reasonably practicable after the Expiration Time, the Issuer will announce, with respect to each Series
of Existing Notes, the principal amount of Existing Notes of such Series validly offered for exchange and accepted
pursuant to the Exchange Offers as of the Expiration Time and the proration factor applicable to any Series of
Notes.

On the Announcement Date, the Issuer will also announce the Settlement Date for the exchange of the Existing
Notes for the New Notes. The Issuer expects the Settlement Date to be 10 Business Days after the Expiration
Time.

The Issuer will not be obligated to issue the New Notes unless the Exchange Offers are consummated. The validly
offered for exchange (and not validly withdrawn) Existing Notes that have been accepted for exchange will be
cancelled upon the consummation of the Exchange Offers on the Settlement Date.

**Method of Announcement**

Unless stated otherwise, announcements in connection with the Exchange Offers will be made by the delivery of
notices to the relevant Clearing System for communication to Direct Participants or by posting a press release to
the Issuer’s website.

116


-----

Delays may be experienced where notices are delivered via the Clearing Systems, other clearing systems, clearing
system participants and other intermediaries and therefore Eligible Holders, subject to the issue and resale
restrictions (See “Issue and Resale Restrictions”), are urged to consult the Exchange and Tabulation Agent for
information regarding the Exchange Offers using the contact details on the back cover of this Exchange Offer
Memorandum. Conveyance of notices and other communications by the Clearing Systems to Direct Participants
and by Direct Participants and/or any other intermediary to Eligible Holders will be governed by arrangements
between them and subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.

**Other Transactions**

The Group continually evaluates different financing alternatives and may decide to enter into new credit facilities,
access the debt capital markets, incur other indebtedness or enter into liability management transactions, including
vendor financing transactions by a special purpose entity and any related senior unsecured credit facilities, from
time to time, including prior to, or within a short time period after, the Settlement Date (such transactions are
herein referred to as “Potential Financing Transactions”). The cash proceeds, if any, of any Potential Financing
Transactions may be used for the redemption, refinancing, repayment or prepayment of existing indebtedness of
any member of the Group, the payment of any fees and expenses in connection therewith or the other transactions
related thereto, and/or distributions or other payments to direct or indirect parent companies. The indebtedness
under any such Potential Financing Transactions by the Group would be incurred in compliance with the
applicable covenants under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indentures. After giving effect to any such
incurrence in compliance with the applicable covenants, including in connection with permitted refinancing debt,
permitted acquisition debt or other exceptions to the restriction on our ability to incur indebtedness, our ratio of
pro forma senior secured indebtedness to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA or ratio of pro forma net indebtedness to
Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA could increase, or our ratio of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to pro forma interest
expense could decrease, and such increases or decreases could be material. Any Potential Financing Transaction
will be made at the Issuer’s election or the election of its relevant subsidiaries, and, if any indebtedness incurred
thereunder is in the form of securities, such securities may be offered and sold pursuant to, and on the terms
described in, a separate offering memorandum or liability management documentation. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to Our Business and Industry—We may incur additional indebtedness prior to, or within a short time_
_period following, the Issue Date, which indebtedness could increase our leverage and may have terms that are_
_more or less favorable than the terms of the New Notes and our other existing indebtedness.”_

The New Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person
who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer
within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined
in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for
offering or selling the New Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been
prepared and therefore offering or selling the New Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor
in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. This Exchange Offer Memorandum has been prepared
on the basis that any offer of New Notes in any Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption
under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of New Notes. This
Exchange Offer Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended, the “FSMA”) and any
rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer
would not qualify as a “professional client”, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014
as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (“UK MiFIR”); or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as

(as amended, the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the New Notes described in the

###### PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION

**Financial Information**

This Exchange Offer Memorandum includes the historical financial statements listed below (together, our
“Financial Statements”):

(a) the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Nidda German Topco GmbH
(“German Topco”) as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2022, including unaudited comparative
information as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2021, which are presented in accordance with the
International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the EU (“IFRS”) applicable to interim financial
reporting (IAS 34) (the “Topco Interim Financial Statements”); and

(b) the audited consolidated financial statements of German Topco as of and for each of the years ended
December 31, 2019, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, which are presented in accordance with
IFRS and the supplementary provisions pursuant to Section 315(e)(1) of the German Commercial Code
(“HGB”), including the respective auditor’s reports thereon (the “Topco Audited Financial Statements”).

We have included in this Exchange Offer Memorandum the consolidated financial statements of German Topco
instead of the Issuer, because we report our consolidated financial condition and results of operations on an
ongoing basis at the level of German Topco. The notes to German Topco’s consolidated financial statements
include reconciliation columns to the consolidated financial statements of each of Nidda BondCo GmbH (the
“Senior Notes Issuer”) and the Issuer. In the “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information,”
“Capitalization,” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results _of Operations”_
sections of this Exchange Offer Memorandum, we have presented the financial information of the Senior Notes
Issuer as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and as of and for the six months
ended June 30, 2021 and 2022. We believe that this presentation is more useful to investors than presenting the
financial information of German Topco because such presentation excludes additional interest expense and
liabilities outside the perimeter of the restricted group of the Senior Notes Issuer. In this Exchange Offer
Memorandum, we present the financial information of the Senior Notes Issuer, as opposed to the Issuer, because
the financial information of the Senior Notes Issuer reflects the Senior Notes Issuer’s obligations under the Senior
Notes, which we believe provides a more meaningful illustration of the Group’s capital structure.

As of the date of this Exchange Offer Memorandum, each of German Topco, Nidda German Midco GmbH
(“German Midco”), the Senior Notes Issuer and the Issuer is a holding, management and finance company with
no business operations of its own. The Senior Notes Issuer’s only material assets consist of its indirect interest in
the share capital and intercompany loans of STADA Arzneimittel Aktiengesellschaft (“STADA”) to the Issuer.
The Senior Notes Issuer’s only material liabilities consist of the obligations under the Senior Notes and deeply
subordinated shareholder loans. The Issuer’s only material assets consists of its indirect interests in STADA’s
share capital and intercompany loans to Nidda Healthcare GmbH (“German Holdco”) (if any). The Issuer’s only
material liabilities consist of the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities (each as defined below). German Topco’s only material assets consist of its indirect interest in STADA’s
share capital and intercompany loans to its direct subsidiary, German Midco. German Topco’s only material
liabilities consist of the obligations under shareholder loans owed to its immediate parent company, Nidda MidCo
S.à r.l.

In the year ended December 31, 2020, we changed the presentation of interest paid in accordance with IAS 8 to
report it under Financing Cash Flow instead of Operating Cash Flow. The financial information for the year ended
December 31, 2019 presented in this Exchange Offer Memorandum has been retrospectively adjusted and reflects
the modified presentation and has been taken from the comparative financial information for the year ended
December 31, 2019 included in the Topco Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December
31, 2020. The retrospective adjustment of financial information also applies for our acquisition of Biopharma’s
pharmaceutical prescription and consumer health business in Ukraine, as the purchase price allocation for this
transaction was finalized in the year ended December 31, 2020.

The financial information of the Senior Notes Issuer for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022 is unaudited and
has been calculated by taking the unaudited interim financial information for the six months ended June 30, 2022,
adding it to the audited financial information for the year ended December 31, 2021, and then subtracting the
unaudited interim financial information for the six months ended June 30, 2021 all derived from the Topco
Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the Topco Interim Financial
Statements as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2022 (including an unaudited comparative information as

123


-----

of and for the six months ended June 30, 2021), as applicable, included elsewhere in this Exchange Offer
Memorandum. The financial information for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, has not been audited or
reviewed by our auditors, is not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS or any other generally accepted
accounting principles and has been prepared for illustrative purposes only. This information is not necessarily
representative of our financial information for such a period or any future period or any financial position at any
past or future date. The financial information for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022 has been prepared solely
for the purpose of this Exchange Offer Memorandum and was not prepared in the ordinary course of German
Topco’s financial reporting.

This Exchange Offer Memorandum includes certain financial information as of and for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2022, presented at the level of the Senior Notes Issuer, on an adjusted basis to give pro forma effect to
the Exchange Offers and certain other transactions as described in “Capitalization,” including financial data as
adjusted to reflect the effect of the Exchange Offers and such transactions on the Issuers’ indebtedness as if the
Exchange Offers and such transactions had occurred on June 30, 2022, and on the Senior Notes Issuer’s interest
expense as if the Exchange Offers had occurred July 1, 2021. The pro forma financial information as of and for
the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent
what the Issuers’ indebtedness or interest expense would have been had the Exchange Offers and certain other
transactions as described in “Capitalization” occurred on June 30, 2022, or July 1, 2021, respectively; nor does it
purport to project the Issuers’ financial results, indebtedness or interest expense at any future date. The pro forma
financial information as of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, has been prepared by the Senior Notes
Issuer and has not been prepared in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting standards
or in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S X of the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation,
or any other regulations of the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission, or any other regulator.
PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled
nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments nor the
resulting pro forma financial information as of and for twelve months ended June 30, 2022. Accordingly,
PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft does not express an opinion or any other form
of assurance with respect thereto. The auditor’s reports of PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft included in this document relate to Topco Audited Financial Statements. They
do not extend to the pro forma financial information, as described above, and should not be read to do so.

When calculating sales by country as presented in this Exchange Offer Memorandum, we allocate sales to the
country of the invoice recipient.

We present certain financial information in this Exchange Offer Memorandum for our three operational divisions,
our Generics division, our Consumer Healthcare division and our Specialty division. The Financial Statements do
not present the financial data of these divisions. We present divisional financial information in this Exchange
Offer Memorandum as we believe it provides useful information to investors about our business. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Operating
_Divisions.”_

The label “audited”, is used in this Exchange Offer Memorandum to indicate financial information that has been
taken from the Topco Audited Financial Statements. The label “unaudited” is used to indicate financial
information that has not been taken from the Topco Audited Financial Statements, but has been derived from the
Topco Audited Financial Statements, has been taken either from the Topco Interim Financial Statements or the
accounting records or the internal management reporting systems of Topco or has been calculated based on
financial information from the aforementioned sources.

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

**_General_**

In this Exchange Offer Memorandum, we present certain financial measures that are not recognized by IFRS or
any other generally accepted accounting principles and that may not be permitted to appear on the face of the
Financial Statements or footnotes thereto. The primary Non-GAAP financial measures used in this Exchange
Offer Memorandum include Adjusted Capital Expenditures, Adjusted Cash Conversion, Adjusted Free Cash
Flow, adjusted net income, adjusted operating profit, adjusted sales, capital expenditures, constant currency sales,
gross margin, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Net Working Capital
and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (our “Non-GAAP Measures”). Each of the EBITDA-based and net incomebased measures presented in this Exchange Offer Memorandum is defined and calculated differently from the
definition of “Consolidated Net Income” and “Consolidated EBITDA” presented in the Indentures.

124


-----

Our primary Non-GAAP Measures are defined as follows:

- “Adjusted Capital Expenditures” is defined as capital expenditures (as defined below), excluding payments
for significant investments and acquisitions;

- “Adjusted Cash Conversion” is defined as Adjusted Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA (as
defined below);

- “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA, adjusted for certain special items;

- “Adjusted EBITDA margin” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by sales;

- “Adjusted Free Cash Flow” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA (as defined above), less Adjusted Capital
Expenditures (as defined above). The definition of “Adjusted Free Cash Flow” used in the Financial
Statements for regular reporting purposes differs from the definition of Adjusted Free Cash Flow used in
this Exchange Offer Memorandum;

- “adjusted net income” is defined as net income attributable to controlling shareholders, adjusted for special
items;

- “adjusted operating profit” is defined as operating profit, adjusted for certain special items;

- “adjusted sales” is defined as sales, adjusted for currency effects;

- “capital expenditures” is defined as the total of payments for investments in intangible assets, property
plant and equipment, financial assets as well as business combinations in accordance with IFRS 3 and
business combinations in accordance with IFRS 3 (VAT);

- “constant currency sales” is defined as sales, adjusted so that all of our non-euro denominated sales are
translated into euro at the same constant exchange rate in all periods presented;

- “EBITDA” is defined as earnings after taxes before financial income and expenses, income tax expenses,
depreciation, amortization and impairment losses;

- “EBITDA margin” is defined as EBITDA divided by sales;

- “Gross margin” is defined as gross profit divided by sales;

- “Net Working Capital” is defined as inventories plus trade accounts receivables less trade accounts
payables; and

- “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted for certain normalizations, runrates and cost-savings. These adjustments and cost savings have been determined solely by the Senior Notes
Issuer as further described in the Exchange Offer Memorandum and should not be attributed to STADA.

Until December 31, 2019, our adjusted operating profit and adjusted net income only included adjustments on
account of the STADA Acquisition when referring to “purchase price allocation.” With effect from January 1,
2020 (including the comparative financial information for the year ended December 31, 2019), we also adjust
these measures for other valuation effects, including additional scheduled depreciation and other measurement
effects due to purchase price allocations and significant product acquisitions.

By eliminating potential differences in results of operations between periods or companies caused by factors such
as depreciation and amortization methods, historical cost and age of assets, financing and capital structures and
taxation positions or regimes, we believe EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA
margin, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, and gross margin can provide a useful additional basis for comparing the
current performance of the underlying operations being evaluated. By eliminating certain effects that affect the
comparability between periods, we believe adjusted sales, constant currency sales, adjusted operating profit, gross
margin and adjusted net income enhance investors’ understanding of our underlying operating performance and
may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. We believe a presentation of
Adjusted Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Cash Conversion, net working capital, capital expenditures and Adjusted
Capital Expenditures is useful to investors to assess our liquidity. For these reasons, we believe that our Non
125


-----

GAAP Measures and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested
parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity.

Our Non-GAAP Measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should
not be considered as alternatives to performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally
accepted accounting principles. Each of our Non-GAAP Measures is defined and reconciled to its closest
comparable IFRS measure under “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information.” Our Non-GAAP
Measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as
analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as
reported under IFRS. Some of the limitations of Non-GAAP Measures are that:

- they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or contractual
commitments;

- they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

- they do not reflect the significant interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or
principal payments on our debt;

- they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;

- they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated income
statement;

- they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be
indicative of our ongoing operations;

- assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced in
the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and

- other companies in our industry and analysts may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting
their usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, our Non-GAAP Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary
cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to
meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our Financial
Statements and using these Non-GAAP Measures as supplemental tools to evaluate our performance.

**_Constant Currency Sales_**

We present our Financial Statements in euro. As a result, we translate the financial position and results of
operations attributable to our consolidated subsidiaries with a functional currency other than euro into euro, using
average exchange rates as of the dates and during the periods presented. In this Exchange Offer Memorandum,
we present our sales not only as reported under IFRS, but also on a constant currency basis using the Non-GAAP
Measure titled “constant currency sales”. Constant currency sales removes the distorting effect of fluctuations in
the exchange rates we use in the translation of our non-euro denominated sales into euro by instead assuming that
exchange rates were constant in all periods. We believe that this measure facilitates an understanding of the
underlying economic performance of our operations. Our constant currency sales for the years ended December
31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2022 are computed by translating
the actual values of our non-euro denominated sales as per our subsidiaries’ financial statements using the
following adjusted foreign exchange rates instead of the actual foreign exchange rates used for reporting purposes
during the applicable period (except with respect to consolidation adjustments):

(1) Each constant foreign exchange rate presented in this column was used in calculating constant currency sales. Each rate is equal to the
actual average foreign exchange rate to euro of the corresponding currency during the 90 days ended May 20, 2022.

**_Adjusted Sales_**

We also report the Non-GAAP Measure adjusted sales which is defined as sales, adjusted for currency effects.
The adjustment in respect of currency effects removes the distorting impact of exchange rate movements that
affect the comparability between periods. In calculating this adjustment in each period, we use the same foreign
exchange rates as in the comparative period to translate our non-euro denominated sales into euro for the prior
year period.

In the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Results of Operations,” we provide a tabular reconciliation for each period between adjusted sales_
and reported sales, its closest comparable IFRS measure. Each such reconciliation table also shows the
comparative data for the previous period. Investors should note that such comparative data is solely meant to
illustrate the comparative basis for the later period and differs from the actual adjusted sales data for the previous
period.

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures set out in this Exchange Offer Memorandum, including financial data presented in
million or thousand and percentage terms, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals
of the data in this Exchange Offer Memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such
information. In addition, as a result of such rounding, the totals of certain financial information presented in tabular
form may differ from the information that would have appeared in such totals using the unrounded financial
information. Percentages and amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating to financial and other data set
forth in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” are calculated
using the numerical data in the Financial Statements contained in this Exchange Offer Memorandum, as

**Overview**

We are a leading healthcare and pharmaceuticals company focused on generics, consumer healthcare (“CHC”)
and specialty medicines with a successful track record spanning over 120 years. With more than 600 CMOs and
25,000 SKUs covering many therapeutic areas, we develop, manufacture and market a diversified product
portfolio that includes many category leaders. We distribute our products in approximately 120 countries and have
a direct presence in all major European markets, as well as in growth markets in the MENA region, Asia and
Australia.

We rank as the fourth-largest player by gross sales in Europe in the market for generics and OTC medicines,
according to IQVIA. Our market leading positions provide us with a competitive advantage, which is bolstered
by our scale, brands, reputation and the breadth and diversification of our product portfolio, as well as our local
market expertise and established distribution channels built on strong relationships with wholesalers and
pharmacies. We continually work to optimize and manage our costs, including through our cost-effective
manufacturing footprint comprising 20 production facilities across Europe and Asia. Building on our tried and
tested platform, we launched over 790 individual products in 2020 and over 980 in 2021. Our solid pipeline of
new products provides us with further opportunities as our markets grow. We have a strong track record of growth,
both organically and through focused acquisitions, and seek to grow our business and further improve our
profitability by internationalizing successful products. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, we generated
sales of €3,510.8 million and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of €912.4 million.

We have categorized our products into the following three divisions: Generics, Consumer Healthcare and
Specialty:

_Generics: Our Generics division comprises prescription drugs sold under an international non-proprietary name_
(“INN generics”). Generics offer a lower cost alternative to the substantially more expensive pharmaceutical
originator products. Most of the products in our Generics division require a prescription for purchase and are only
available from pharmacies and/or hospitals. The market for prescription products is generally characterized by
regulated pricing, with competition driven by the reliability of supply and cost competitiveness. Patent expirations
and loss of regulatory market exclusivity of originator drugs feed our product pipeline in the Generics division,
allowing us to leverage our distribution channels and local market knowledge to launch new generic products.
Our Generics portfolio is diversified, with the top ten products accounting for less than 18% of sales in our
Generics division for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. The top ten products by sales (and their respective
therapeutic areas) in our Generics division for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, were: Tilidine (pain &
relief), Atorvastatin (cardio), Amoxiclav (antibiotics), Pantoprazole (gastro), Omeprazole (gastro), Diclofenac
(pain & relief), Bisoprolol (cardio), Amlodipine (cardio), Ezetimibe (cardio) and Olmesartan (hypertension). The
largest countries by sales in our Generics division for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, were Germany,
Italy, Belgium, Spain, Serbia, Switzerland, France, Vietnam, Russia and the Netherlands. We generated sales of
€1,377.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA of €336.4 million in our Generics division in the twelve months ended
June 30, 2022.

_Consumer Healthcare: Our Consumer Healthcare division comprises non-prescription medicines with regulatory_
status, such as OTC medicines or medical devices, cosmeceuticals and cosmetics, vitamins, minerals and
supplements (“VMS”) and certain consumer products such as the household disinfectant Zoflora. We market our
Consumer Healthcare products with a focus on product features, awareness and trust in the product or brand as
well as through endorsement by healthcare professionals such as pharmacists and doctors. While we have many
strong and large brands with leading positions in their respective markets, our portfolio of Consumer Healthcare
products is very diversified, with the top ten CHC products accounting for less than 29% of sales in our Consumer
Healthcare division for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. The top ten selling brands (and their respective
therapeutic areas) in our Consumer Healthcare division for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, were:
Cardiomagnyl (cardio), Zoflora (disinfectants), Nizoral (derma), Aqualor (cough & cold), Snup (cough & cold),

128


-----

Paracetamol (pain & relief), Vitaprost (women & men’s health), Grippostad (cough & cold), Levomecol (derma)
and Artra (pain & relief). The largest countries by sales in our Consumer Healthcare division for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2022 were Russia, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Italy. We generated sales
of €1,450.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA of €388.1 million in our Consumer Healthcare division in the twelve
months ended June 30, 2022.

_Specialty: Our Specialty division comprises the following three product categories:_

- _Branded generics, which includes prescription generics sold under a brand name, as opposed to INN generics._

- _Specialty_ _generics as defined by IQVIA, which comprises prescription drugs for chronic, complex or rare_
diseases which also meet at least three of the following criteria: (i) high annual costs, (ii) initiated and
maintained by a specialist for drug therapy, (iii) special procedure required (refrigerated, frozen or prone to
other biohazards), (iv) reimbursement assistance required, (v) limited distribution and (vi) extensive
monitoring or comprehensive patient counseling required.

- _Biosimilars, which are biologic medicinal products that are equivalent to an existing originator product._
Unlike small-molecule drugs, biologics contain active substances from a biological source, such as living
cells or organisms are often produced using advanced technology. Examples of biologics include insulin,
growth hormones and monoclonal antibodies. Despite not having to be identical to the originator product,
biosimilars must nevertheless demonstrate bio-equivalence.

We are continually expanding our existing range of products in the Specialty division. The top ten Specialty
products accounted for approximately 59% of sales in the division in the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. Our
top ten Specialty brands with their corresponding generic names were Silapo (Epoetin Zeta biosimilar), Apo-go
(Apomorhine), which is marketed in several countries under brand names APO-go, MOVAPO and APOKYN,
Edarbi (branded generic of azilsartan medoxomil), Bortezomib STADA (subcutaneous, ready-to-use injection,
branded generic to Velcade), Movymia (biosimilar of Fosteo or Teriparatid), Xefocam (branded generic of
Lornoxicam), Ovayas (biosimilar of Avastin or Bevacizumab), Versatis, Vipidia (branded generic of alogliptin)
and Lecigon. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, our Specialty division generated sales of €682.9 million
and Adjusted EBITDA of €193.0 million.

**Our Strengths**

**_Attractive Market Fundamentals for our Product Categories and Geographies_**

Generics are the backbone of almost every healthcare system and play a vital role in providing people across the
world with affordable medicines. Generics also incentivize innovation through competition and operational
efficiencies they bring to healthcare systems. Growth fundamentals in generics are robust. According to our
calculations on the basis of IQVIA, originator products with average sales of €7 billion per annum will lose patent
protection between 2022 and 2026 in the largest European pharmaceutical markets Germany, France, Italy, the
UK and Spain. According to IQVIA, generic penetration rates, i.e. the share of generic medicines of the total
prescription drug market, in many markets such as Italy, Belgium, France and Switzerland, are still well below
60% and an increase in the percentage of older people in the total population is driving greater need for medication.
Moreover, the diversity of regulatory requirements and the complexity of the value chain provide natural barriers
to entry.

The global CHC market grew strongly by 7.3% in 2021 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.8% between
2021 and 2025, according to IQVIA. Increasing cost pressures on national healthcare systems in the markets in
which we operate are causing more consumers to opt for self-medication. As consumers in the CHC market are
paying out of their own pocket, they are more likely to opt for the local brands they are familiar with, which means
there is less pressure on manufacturers to compete on price than in other segments of the global healthcare market.
In this environment, leading originator pharmaceutical companies tend to focus on specialty products (particularly
in oncology) rather than retail and mass market products, as demonstrated by the divestment by Takeda to us, of
the Takeda CIS Assets. Within the CHC market, companies are narrowing in on their core portfolio areas while
divesting non-core assets. For example, in 2017, Sanofi and Boehringer Ingelheim divested their non-care animal
health and consumer health businesses. Emerging CHC category leaders focus on the internationalization of
leading global CHC brands such as Aspirin, Wicks or Advil, while divesting lesser known local CHC brands, as
part of their strategy. As a result, there is growth potential for a player like us, with our ability to activate
underleveraged and niche brands through locally agile and consumer insight driven strategies.

129


-----

Specialty, including biosimilars, is an emerging field. According to IQVIA, biosimilars are expected to grow at a
CAGR of 15.6% between 2021 and 2031. We believe that the patent expiration of more than 100 biologics in the
next decade and constant innovation in delivery technologies make the area an exciting field for those companies
that master the complex development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercialization requirements.

We believe that the attractive market environment, combined with our capabilities and agility in marketing and
selling, portfolio management and launch performance, product supply and a strong execution of our strategies is
our key strength.

**_Broad Generics Portfolio with Leading Market Positions across Europe, Attractive Portfolio of Strong Local_**
**_Brands in Consumer Healthcare and Scalable Platform for Commercialization of Specialty/Biosimilars_**

We have a strong foothold in generics, with a broad product range covering most off-patent drugs across EUmarkets as well as Serbia, Bosnia, the Western Balkans and several other non-EU countries including Vietnam.
We are the market leaders in generics in Serbia and Belgium and hold a top three market position in Germany and
Switzerland and a top four market position in Italy and Spain, according to IQVIA. In many of these countries,
there is still potential for continued market growth as the generic penetration is still very low. For example, as of
2021, generic penetration was 28% in Belgium, 36% in Italy and Spain, 47% in Germany and 48% in France,
according to IQVIA. With increasing pressure on healthcare budgets, generic penetration and therefore generic
markets are expected to continue to grow; for example, according to IQVIA, Italy and Spain are expected to grow
by a CAGR of 5.5% and 1.1%, respectively, from 2021 to 2025. We believe that we can capitalize on growth
upsides in many other countries by leveraging our pan-EU product registrations and our existing local
infrastructure to gain market share.

In Consumer Healthcare, we benefit from an attractive portfolio with many strong local brands and products across
a wide spectrum of therapeutic areas such as cardio, gastro, cough & cold, dermatology, pain & relief, sleep or
VMS across many countries. We have significantly expanded our geographic footprint within CHC over the past
years, with the successful integration of CHC products (including a strong portfolio of food supplements across
Central and eastern European Countries) acquired from GlaxoSmithKline, Walmark, Takeda and Sanofi. See “—
_Leading Marketing & Selling Capabilities combined with Excellence in Portfolio-Acceleration through Product_
_Launches, Business Development & Licensing and M&A” and “—Superior growth through portfolio acceleration_
_via Launches, BD&L and M&A” below. We now have strong local brands in most countries in which we are_
present, which benefit from strong brand familiarity among patients and customers. Many of these brands have a
leading position within their categories, such as Grippostad, Silomat, Kamistad and Cetebe in Germany; Nizoral
in the UK; Cardiomagnyl, Artra, Vitaprost and Aqualor in Russia; Lunestil, Serelys and Sikikom in Belgium;
Hirudoid in Belgium, Italy, the Nordics and Austria; Nizoral in several European countries or Biopron in Czech
Republic and Slovakia.

In Specialty, we have made a focused effort over the past years to strengthen our capabilities and accelerate our
pipeline:

- In 2019, we developed and commercialized an innovative, ready to use formulation of cancer-drug
Bortezomib, which does not need to be dissolved before processing, as required for Velcade, the JanssenCilag originator drug,and thus offers a better value proposition.

- In 2020, we acquired Lecigon through the acquisition of Lobsor, its Swedish owner. Lecigon is a novel
medicine for the treatment of advanced Parkinson, combining levodopa, carbidopa and entacapone, which is
infused via a lightweight pump. We are now in the process of launching Lecigon across Europe.

- In 2021, we entered a partnership with Swedish Calliditas Therapeutics AB for the registration and marketing
of a novel specialty pharmaceutical candidate for the treatment of the chronic autoimmune kidney disease
immunoglobulin A nephropathy (“IgAN”) in the EEA, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. This orphan
drug combines Calliditas’s drug development expertise with our pan-European Marketing & Sales expertise
in specialty medicines, in particular in nephrology. The European Commission has granted conditional
marketing authorization for Kinpeygo (budesonide) capsules for the treatment of primary immunoglobulin A
IgAN in adults at risk of rapid disease progression with a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of equal to or greater
than 1.5 g/gram. Kinpeygo is an orphan medicinal product and the first and only approved treatment for
IgAN, a rare, progressive autoimmune disease of the kidney with a high unmet need and with more than 50%
of patients potentially progressing to end-stage renal disease. Through a partnership with developer Calliditas
Therapeutics, Kinpeygo will be marketed in the EEA exclusively by STADA. The conditional marketing

-----

authorization applies in all 27 European Union member states, as well as Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.
We intend to initiate launches in European markets in 2022.

- In the area of biosimilars, where the development risk is highest and manufacturing is more difficult due to
higher quality standards, we have chosen to source and co-develop products with external partners who have
proven development and production capabilities. As such, we have a partnership in place with Xbrane
Biopharma AB, a Swedish biosimilar company, for the joint development of a ranibizumab biosimilar and
optional cooperation on further biosimilars. We have entered into an exclusive strategic partnership with
Alvotech, an international biopharmaceutical company for the commercialization of six biosimilars
throughout Europe. Adalimumab (Hukyndra), the first biosimilar developed as part of our partnership with
Alvotech, received marketing authorization approval in November 2021 and was launched in Germany,
France and Netherlands in June 2022. We currently have four biosimilars in the market: Silapo, an
erythropoietin biosimilar; Cegfila, a pegfilgrastim biosimilar; Movymia, a teriparatide biosimilar; and
Oyavas, a bevacizumab biosimilar.

**_High Differentiation Driving Resilience, Agility and Synergies_**

We are diversified in terms of geographies, products and therapeutic areas as well as sales channels, customers,
and suppliers, thus significantly limiting exposure to any single product, country, reimbursement system, customer
or supplier. In the year ended December 31, 2021, no single product accounted for more than 3% and no single
country for more than 16%, of our net sales.

In addition, our local presence in approximately 120 countries across different product categories and different
go-to-market characteristics makes us agile on a local level while leveraging synergies across divisions and
countries. For example, being successful in generics in Germany, the UK and the Nordics requires strong price
competitiveness, which is supported by our global operations and supply chain synergies, and ability to navigate
national tender bodies and processes. In contrast, generic sales in pharmacy-driven countries like France, Spain
and Italy require strong relationships with pharmacies, cost-effective manufacturing capabilities (with synergies
across divisions) and high product supply reliability and service levels. In many eastern European markets by
contrast, strong product branding and promotions with physicians are often most important, allowing us to
capitalize on synergies across divisions to successfully deploy our medical sales force and media strategies.
Moreover, our scale and local market expertise allow us to respond relatively quickly to new consumer trends,
leverage regulatory know-how and exploit economies of scale in production, packaging, procurement, distribution
and other logistics.

**_Leading Marketing & Selling Capabilities combined with Excellence in Portfolio-Acceleration through_**
**_Product Launches, Business Development & Licensing and M&A_**

Our key strengths include our ability to maximize profitable growth of our existing portfolio through our
commercialization capabilities, product launch engine and business development and licensing (“BD&L”) and
M&A capabilities.

_Commercialization Engine:_ In the course of our long operational history and local market presence, we have
established strong relationships with physicians, pharmacies, wholesalers and logistic providers. We adopt a strict
return-on-investment approach with regard to resource-allocation and marketing and selling investment decisions
and seek to ensure that the business case for significant expenditures in marketing and selling are justified ex ante
and monitored regularly.

_Product Launch Engine:_ We are highly familiar with regulatory requirements in our key markets and have
developed leading expertise in dealing with regulatory, reimbursement, tendering and distribution issues. The
regulatory requirements for generics, specialty and CHC products can be complex and vary across countries and
therefore, provide us a significant competitive advantage over any new market entrants or other players with less
experience. Our regulatory expertise together with our product development efforts enable us to continuously
bring new products onto the market. We launched over 790 individual products in 2020 and over 980 in 2021.

_BD&L and M&A Engine: We have also established a strong track record in BD&L and M&A, spanning all steps_
from identification of potential in-licensing and acquisition targets, to thorough due diligence, sophisticated
budgeting and forecasting, and crafting bespoke acquisition agreements with performance-based variable
components to successful launch and integration. In 2019, we acquired from GlaxoSmithKline five skincare
brands and a pediatric cough remedy in Europe, as well as selected markets in APAC and Latin America, and
expanded our footprint in Eastern Europe and Asia through our acquisitions of Biopharma’s pharmaceutical

131


-----

prescription and consumer health business in Ukraine. In 2020, we acquired several well-known CHC brands and
prescription medicines from Takeda. With the acquisition of Walmark, a leading consumer health and food
supplement provider across Central Europe, we significantly expanded our CHC footprint in Czech Republic,
Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and the Baltic states. In the second half of 2020, we acquired a
portfolio of 15 well-established CHC brands from GlaxoSmithKline for several European countries. In addition,
also in 2020, we made several smaller local acquisitions such as the Fern C Consumer Health Business in the
Philippines and the acquisition of the customer portfolio of Opti Pharm AG, a specialist in the trade and
distribution of pharmaceutical products to self-dispensing doctors in Switzerland. In 2021, we continued to
significantly strengthen our European CHC portfolio through the acquisition of 16 well-established local
consumer healthcare brands from Sanofi, predominantly in European countries including France, Germany, Italy,
Poland and Spain. We also entered into a distribution agreement with Sanofi under which we began distributing
and marketing a Sanofi portfolio of approximately 50 established CHC brands in 20 European countries. We
have instituted a rigorous process of establishing a business plan and tracking performance of our acquisitions and
believe that in aggregate, our acquisitions have outperformed the business plan. In addition to the acquisitions, we
have successfully completed several licensing agreements, including with Lobsor, Calliditas, Xbrane and
Alvotech. We have closed 34 licensing deals in the first half of 2022, comprising of 17 in Generics, 14 in
Consumer Healthcare and four in Specialty.

**_Competitive Advantage Through Cost-Effective Manufacturing Footprint, Global Scale in Procurement and_**
**_Agile Supply Chain mastering complexity_**

_Cost-Effective Manufacturing: We have a geographically diversified and cost-effective manufacturing footprint,_
with 20 production sites in 12 countries and 54% of our production volume in 2021 being manufactured in lower
cost countries in Eastern Europe and Asia. This provides us with a relatively low cost and highly flexible
production base. Our manufacturing sites are regularly audited and certified by supervisory bodies. Fifteen of our
sites are required to comply with stringent EU standards and are EU certified plants. Plants without EU
certification operate based on strict adherence to the relevant country requirements for the production of either
medicines or food supplements. Moreover, local production helps provide a natural hedge for currency
fluctuations and regulatory restrictions, and at times is an advantage in the marketing of products in certain
countries. We continuously seek to improve and manage our costs in order to increase our margins and potential
for growth and stable cash flows, and we intend to further streamline and improve our manufacturing operations
by optimizing the utilization of each plant. Furthermore, we have implemented operating expense-saving
programs in order to drive continuous improvements through lean processes and culture, an Overall Equipment
Effectiveness uplift program for productivity growth and a Total Productive Maintenance program for
preventative maintenance.

_Procurement and Supply Chain: We have a flexible and efficient Procurement and Supply Chain organization in_
place, which is a pre-requisite to managing our complex product portfolio and the supply landscape of internal
and external manufacturing sites. Through an integrated end-to-end approach that balances supply security,
inventory levels and competitive Cost of Goods Sold (“COGS”), we seek to ensure reliable supply to our
customers without interruptions. External suppliers are managed like internal suppliers. To further strengthen our
internal process, we established a unit called External Supply Operations (“ESO”) in 2021, which is the single
point of contact in STADA for all matters relating to contract manufacturing organization (“CMO”), including
new in-licensing deals, launches, commercial product life cycle management and termination. ESO provides
technical and operational support to our BD&L, Supply Chain, Technology Transfer and Global Launch functions,
all of which help maintain our revenue pipeline and identify growth acceleration opportunities.

**_Highly Experienced Management Team Supported by Committed Sponsors and Engaged Workforce with_**
**_Strong Values-Based Culture_**

_STADA Management Board: We have a highly experienced management team led by Peter Goldschmidt, who_
has been our Chief Executive Officer since September 2018 and draws on over 31 years of experience in the
pharmaceutical industry. Having held various senior management positions in Europe, Asia and the United States
for the Novartis Group, Mr. Goldschmidt also served as the President of Sandoz USA and the Head of North
America at Sandoz, where he rapidly expanded the company’s generics and biosimilar business, generating
revenues of over $3 billion. He was also the global executive member for Central and Eastern Europe for Sandoz,
leading Sandoz to a top ranking market position in generics and rapidly growing its OTC business. Our leadership
team further includes: Boris Döbler, who was appointed Chief Financial Officer (ad-interim) of STADA on
August 18, 2022, after serving as STADA’s CFO Europe and Group Vice-President of Global Financial Planning
& Analysis., Miguel Pagan Fernandez who was appointed Chief Technical Officer of STADA on July 1, 2018,
having previously served as the Head of Global Technical Operations (Solids and Special Technologies) of

Novartis and Simone Berger, Chief Human Resource Officer who was appointed in January 2019 and who joined
the Executive Board in April 2021.

_Sponsors: We also draw from the market expertise, business relationships, knowledge and experience of our_
Sponsors, Bain Capital and Cinven. Both our Sponsors have strong healthcare expertise and an extensive and
successful track record of investing in companies in the healthcare sector. For example, Bain Capital increased
sales by 49% within two years and significantly increased the workforce at Bio Products Laboratory, creating a
life sciences champion in the United Kingdom, while Cinven combined two large laboratory diagnostics
companies, Synlab (Germany) and Labco (France), at the end of 2015, to form Synlab Group (headquartered in
Germany), the European champion in laboratory diagnostics. In addition, Cinven in 2012 invested in Mercury
Pharma and Amdipharm, and merged the two businesses to create AMCo, a major player in the fragmented
generics market in the United Kingdom. Cinven’s strategy centered on continued buy and build, further
internationalization and applying best practice across both companies, and resulted in AMCo’s sale to
TSX/Nasdaq listed Concordia Healthcare Corp for £2.3 billion in 2015. Cinven has also acquired LGC, a global
leader in the life sciences sector. Both Sponsors also have a strong track record of driving cost savings and
improvements in margins, while at the same time growing their portfolio companies both organically and through
targeted acquisitions.

_Highly-Engaged Workforce and Values-Based Company Culture: Our strong leadership team and private equity_
ownership have helped over the past years to also attract and retain top talent at the operational level. We were
named a top employer in Germany by the Top Employers Institute in 2021 and 2022, highlighting our exemplary
work in personnel management. The Top Employers Institute recognizes companies for their strong human
resources internationally. The evaluation criteria for the award includes personnel management and corporate
culture, including workforce planning, talent acquisition, development programs, performance management and
benefits. Our leadership team has prioritized employee engagement and a strong values-based culture. We have
carried out an intensive workforce engagement process and revised and re-articulated our values: Integrity,
Entrepreneurship, Agility and “one STADA”, which has received an enthusiastic response. In our latest employee
feedback survey, which 82% of our employees participated and over 30,000 comments were received, we
achieved a rating of 8.2 out of 10. We believe that our values reflect our past heritage as well as future
opportunities and serve as basis for decision-making. We believe that our values provide us with a purpose and
vision and differentiate us from our peers.

We have been able to deliver strong financial results in terms of sales and EBITDA-growth and cash flow
generation. Our constant currency sales increased at a CAGR of 14% from December 31, 2019 to December 31,
2021. We had Adjusted Cash Conversion of 87% and 84% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021,
respectively. Our EBITDA margin increased from 19% in the year ended December 31, 2020, to 23% in the year
ended December 31, 2021. Our business has significant operating leverage and low ongoing liquidity
requirements. We have historically experienced only modest seasonal net working capital movements, and our
management has consistently maintained a high degree of discipline around capital expenditures. As a
manufacturer of generics, we typically incur limited development expenses and no material research expenses.

In the six months ended June 30, 2022, we have outperformed most of our key competitors in terms of growth in
net sales.

**Our Strategy**

Over the past five years, our leadership team in collaboration with the Sponsors has established a clear strategic
roadmap for us, which is set forth below.

**_Double Down on our Strengths with Commercial Agility and Enterprise Leadership_**

We believe that our broad generics portfolio, leading local CHC brands and scalable Specialty platform (including
biosimilars) in combination with our very strong territorial and customer coverage across Europe and other
countries are something that only few competitors can match and that allows us to continuously capitalize on the
attractive market fundamentals in our industry. In addition, we believe that our agile, flexible, and local market
focused approach differentiates us from our competitors and allows us to pursue financially attractive
commercialization opportunities across our business divisions.

We encourage local teams to be entrepreneurial, giving them autonomy to pursue meaningful business
opportunities that can drive growth. We also acknowledge the need for partnerships as an extension of our own
value chain to fully leverage our commercial capabilities. We seek to apply our standards of excellence to our
partners as well.

We intend to continue focusing geographically on Europe and our other key markets. In other countries, we intend
to seek attractive growth opportunities with flexible and highly commercial operating models (for example,
through partnership with strong local players). In terms of product categories, we will continue to focus on our
three divisions Generics, Consumer Healthcare and Specialty. Our broad Generics portfolio remains resilient and
stable driven by continued growth of generic penetration, the opportunity to grow market share in many countries
and the continuous flow of drugs going off-patent. In Consumer Healthcare, we aim to drive superior growth
through the entrepreneurial and agile activation and expansion of local brands, in contrast with our leading CHC
competitors who often focus on only few global brands and selected categories. In Specialty, we intend to continue
to foster our pipeline of value-added-medicines and biosimilars and ramp-up our commercial capabilities to
capitalize on our existing strong pipeline with over ten biosimilars launches scheduled for the next seven years.

**_Leading Marketing and Sales Capabilities_**

We will continue to focus on our strong Marketing & Sales infrastructure and capabilities, which remain a key
competitive advantage. This comprises not only typical selling and marketing activities and investments, but also
capabilities around trade terms and cost optimization, strategic pricing on CHC products, advanced tender
analytics for generics as well as continued improvements in the area of tools and digitization (e.g. Customer
Relationship Management tools and eCommerce). Through our Marketing & Sales infrastructure, we have built
a leading commercialization platform for the healthcare sector in Europe and certain other global markets, and
this geographic presence is continuously strengthened by acquiring, and successfully integrating strong regional
brands.

**_Portfolio Acceleration via Launches, BD&L and M&A_**

We collaborate internally across our organization to manage and execute new product launches and our current
pipeline of products extends through to 2028 and beyond. We intend to continue adding to this pipeline across
our three divisions. In Generics, particularly in small-molecules oral solids, we intend to leverage our strong
development and manufacturing capabilities to deliver “first in, last out” launches, i.e. entering the market as soon
as we are allowed and maintaining best-in-class cost of sales in order to remain in the market for a long period. In
other divisions, we maintain flexibility in whether to develop products externally or internally. We believe that
we are a partner of choice in Europe, which has helped us gain access to interesting products on attractive terms.
We intend to continue to complete BD&L deals at a high rate, as we have done over the last few years, with an
emphasis on our Specialty division.

Furthermore, we will continue to selectively build on our successful M&A track record, which includes the
successful completion and integration of several recent M&A deals, including: (i) skincare brands and a pediatric
cough remedy in Europe and selected other markets from GlaxoSmithKline in 2019; (ii) Biopharma’s
pharmaceutical prescription and consumer health business in Ukraine in 2019; (iii) the Fern C Consumer Health

134


-----

products in the Philippines in 2020; (iv) the customer portfolio of Opti Pharm AG in Switzerland in 2020, (v)
multiple, highly recognizable Consumer Health brands and prescription medicines from Takeda; (vi) the leading
OTC and food supplement business of Walmark in Central and Eastern Europe in 2020; and (vii) our acquisition
of 16 well-established consumer healthcare brands from Sanofi across 13 countries in 2021. We continue to
selectively explore acquisitions in the Generics, Consumer Healthcare and Specialty areas where we see a strategic
fit, accretive dynamics for our sales and EBITDA growth and significant value creation opportunities.

**_Benchmark Low-Cost Operating Model_**

We have relentlessly driven cost discipline over the past years and aim to operate at benchmark low-cost levels.
The strategic cost-saving initiatives spearheaded under our transformation program established at the end of 2017
have realized aggregate run rate cost savings of more than €187.0 million as of December 31, 2021. We continue
to implement various cost savings initiatives and are targeting additional cost savings of €24.8 million by
December 31, 2022. See “Forward Looking Statements” and “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other
_Information—Other Consolidated Financial and Pro Forma Data.”_

In terms of cost of sales, we have continued initiatives to improve direct product procurement by renegotiating
supply contracts with our fragmented supply base and to create operational improvements in manufacturing by
insourcing certain third-party manufactured products and increasing operational efficiency, while also improving
our supply chain setup and organization through hub, route and order size optimization.

Our general & administrative and support functions are highly capable and scalable with a focus on providing
insights, guidance and leverage to the commercial units in countries that drive growth, minimizing corporate
overhead and bureaucracy by using advanced systems, processes and tools. We plan to maintain cost savings by
not increasing staff in any of the non-volume related functions despite our ambitious planned growth in sales and
complexity.

**_Efficient and Reliable Supply Chain_**

We aim to deliver high-quality products efficiently and with high reliability, underpinned by a strong compliance
foundation. We believe that the supply system needs to be able to manage the complexity of a broad network of
internal and external sites and that a certain diversification of the production and sourcing network is required to
maintain supply in times of economic, environmental, or political crisis. We believe that the key elements of our
ongoing supply chain management, including a broad and flexible in-house manufacturing footprint, best-in-class
external supply management guided by an integrated business-planning approach, an efficient regulatory function
and a rigorous quality approach while ensuring long-term global competitiveness on COGS, will allow us to
efficiently and cost-effectively ensure consistent delivery of our products to our customers.

**_Growth Culture Resulting In Superior Financial Results and Deleveraging_**

We intend to further institutionalize our growth culture and build a world class and high-performing team to ensure
our strategy is sustainable in the long-run. In recent years, we have attracted experienced and well-renowned
industry leaders and have been building a pool of future potential leaders across all areas of the organization. We
will continue to invest in people development through various leadership-training programs, off-sites and the
further promotion of our intensive communication and feedback culture. Furthermore, we will continue to
incentivize out-performance based on our leading values of integrity, agility, entrepreneurship, and ONE STADA.
With a growth mindset, we aim to continuously adapt as an organization to a changing environment, embracing
emerging digital technologies while continuing to focus on our commitment to our broader society – such as our
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) agenda. We see our people as the foundation of our success and
ensure diversity and equal opportunity at all levels of the organization. We believe that with a strong culture,
growth mindset and values as core part of our strategy, we have a self-reinforcing mechanism for the future.

We believe that the execution of the above strategy will help us generate superior financial results with sales and
EBITDA growing at a faster rate than our competition. For our business, which benefits from significant operating
leverage and low ongoing liquidity requirements, we intend to maintain discipline in capital expenditures broadly
in line with historical capital expenditures. In terms of risk management, we benefit from natural hedges against
transaction currency fluctuations where our production facilities are located in the same country as the end
consumer, but we also intend to continue to implement our derivative exchange rate hedging policies.

Based on the above, we believe that the successful execution of our strategies will allow us to further improve
cash flow generation and progressively de-lever the company. Notwithstanding our intention to de-lever and our
focus on organic growth, we also intend to selectively consider acquisition opportunities as and when they arise.

The maturity date of our existing local facilities in Russia has been extended, with two approximately equal

-----

**_Extension of the Revolving Credit Facility_**

Lenders representing more than 90% of the aggregate commitments in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility
have indicated their approval of an extension of the termination date of the Revolving Credit Facility. We expect
the extension will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022.

**_Recent Trading_**

Based on our unaudited management accounts, we estimate that our sales increased by €45.0 million, or 17%,
from €266.3 million for the month ended July 31, 2021 to €311.3 million for the month ended July 31, 2022. We
estimate that Adjusted EBITDA increased by €2.0 million, or 4%, from €58.4 million for the month ended July
31, 2021 to €60.4 million for the month ended July 31, 2022. We estimate that our Adjusted EBITDA for the
twelve months ended July 31, 2022, was €795.8 million. These increases were due to sales increases in all our
three divisions (Generics, Consumer Healthcare and Specialty) and the majority of countries in which we conduct
business.

Factors which impacted our Adjusted EBITDA during this period include increased marketing and selling
expenses, which were lower in the prior period due to the COVID-19 pandemic, targeted expenditures to expand
(including through new product launches) and increase market share of our product portfolio across divisions and
significant foreign exchange losses from the valuation of balance sheet items due to the devaluation of the Russian
ruble in July 2022, Ukrainian Hrywnia and adverse valuations effects from our sterling-denominated loan.

_The preliminary financial results as of and for the month ended July 31, 2022, and the twelve months ended July_
_31, 2022 presented above have not been audited or reviewed by our independent auditors, nor have any_
_procedures been performed by our independent auditors with respect thereto. Such information has been derived_
_from management accounts, is preliminary and is subject to our financial closing procedures which have not yet_
_been completed. While we believe these preliminary results and estimates to be reasonable, our actual results_
_could vary from these estimates and these differences could be material. As such, you should not place undue_
_reliance on this information and this information may not be indicative of our performance in the remainder of_
_the financial year or any future period. See “Forward looking Statements,” “Risk Factors” and “Management’s_
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Exchange Offer Memorandum_

(1) We present our Financial Statements in euro. As a result, we translate the financial position and results of operations attributable
to our consolidated subsidiaries with a functional currency other than euro into euro, using average exchange rates as of the dates
and during the periods presented. In this Exchange Offer Memorandum, we present our sales not only as reported under IFRS, but
also on a constant currency basis using the Non-GAAP Measure of constant currency sales. Constant currency sales is used to
adjust for the distorting effect of fluctuations in the exchange rates we use in the translation of our non-euro denominated sales into
euro by instead assuming that exchange rates were constant in all periods. We believe that this measure facilitates an understanding
of the underlying economic performance of the Group’s operations. For a reconciliation between the foreign exchange rates used
for reporting purposes in our Financial Statements and the foreign exchange rates used for purposes of the calculation of constant
currency sales, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Constant currency
_Sales.”_

(2) We define EBITDA as earnings after taxes before financial income and expenses, income tax expenses, depreciation, amortization
and impairment losses. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, adjusted for certain special items as set forth below. We define
Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted for certain normalizations, run-rates and cost-savings.

By eliminating potential differences in results of operations between periods or companies caused by factors such as depreciation
and amortization methods, historical cost and age of assets, financing and capital structures and taxation positions or regimes, we
believe EBITDA based measures can provide a useful additional basis for comparing the current performance of the underlying
operations being evaluated. For these reasons, we present Non-GAAP Measures such as EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities
analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity.

Our Non-GAAP Measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be
considered as alternatives to performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting
principles. Our Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have
limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as
reported under IFRS. Because of these limitations, our Non-GAAP Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary
cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations.
You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our Financial Statements and using these Non-GAAP
Measures only as supplemental tools to evaluate our performance. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non_GAAP Financial Measures.”_

Set forth below is a reconciliation of each of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to earnings after
taxes which we believe is their closest comparable IFRS measure.

foreign exchange gains (€64.0 million), (ii) in the year ended December 31, 2021, mainly from the release of provisions in
connection with damages (€15.6 million) and foreign exchange gains (€13.3 million), (iii) in the year ended December 31, 2020,
mainly from foreign exchange losses (€55.7 million), provisions in connection with damages (€49.0 million) and our
deconsolidation of SLAM Trading (UK) and Laboratorio Vannier (Argentina) (€13.4 million), and (iv) in the year ended December
31, 2019, mainly from severance expenses.

(E) Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted for normalizations, run-rates and cost savings.

The calculation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is based on various assumptions and estimates by external consultants and
management. This information is inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that
could cause our actual results to differ materially from those assumed in the adjustments presented herein. As a result, while we
believe that these adjustments are reasonable estimates, the actual results in any given period may differ from those estimated
herein. See also “Forward looking Statements.”

The presentation of EBITDA-based measures are for informational purposes only and do not represent the results we would have
achieved had each of the events or items for which an adjustment is made occurred on or prior to July 1, 2021. EBITDA-based
measures are included in this Exchange Offer Memorandum because we believe that each of these metrics provides a useful
measure of our results of operations after giving effect to the initiatives described below; however, these numbers have not been,
and cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm, and this information does not constitute a measure
of financial performance under IFRS. You should not consider EBITDA-based measures as alternatives to net income or any other
performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or as measures of our results of operations or liquidity. Other companies,
including those in our industry, may calculate similarly titled financial measures differently from us, and so the presentation of
such financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. See also “Presentation of
_Financial and Other Information.”_

###### RISK FACTORS

_An investment in the New Notes involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors in the New Notes should_
_carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this Exchange Offer_
_Memorandum before making a decision to invest in the New Notes. Any of the following risks, individually or_
_together, could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects, and_
_accordingly the value of the New Notes. This section describes the risks and uncertainties that we believe are_
_material, but these risks and uncertainties may not be the only ones that we face. Additional risks and_
_uncertainties, including those of which we are currently unaware or those which we deem immaterial, may also_
_result in decreased sales, assets and cash inflows, increased expenses, liabilities or cash outflows or other events_
_that could result in a decline in the value of the New Notes, or which could have a material adverse effect on our_
_business, financial position, results of operations and prospects. The order in which the risks are presented does_
_not necessarily reflect the likelihood of their occurrence or the magnitude of their potential impact on our_
_business, financial position, results of operations and prospects or on the trading price of the New Notes._

**Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry**

The risks that might have a material impact on our business operations include the following:

**_We operate in a highly competitive industry, which may adversely affect our sales, margins and operations._**

Our industry is highly competitive and is driven by a variety of factors, including price, reliability of quality, local
market expertise, distribution channels, portfolio breadth, marketing, packaging and brand loyalty. Our
divisions—Generics, Consumer Healthcare, and Specialty—all face intense competition from our competitors’
products.

Many of our competitors are well-known pharmaceutical companies with substantial financial and other resources.
Companies with more resources may have a greater ability to conduct the development work necessary to obtain
marketing authorizations. Our products could, for example, be rendered obsolete or uneconomical through the
development of new products or technological advances in manufacturing or production by our competitors. Our
competitors’ products may also be, or be perceived as being, more effective or more efficiently marketed and sold
than our products. Our competitors may also be able to sustain a deliberate substantial reduction in the price of
their products or services for longer periods. This is likely to result in significant price pressure in an increasingly
commoditized market, which, in turn, may reduce our sales and market share. In addition, competition in certain
of our markets is particularly intense due to the use of public tenders. Tender systems for generic pharmaceutical
products have been implemented (by both public and private entities) in a number of significant markets in which
we operate, such as Germany, in an effort to lower prices. Under such tender systems, governments or private
entities do not directly set the prices of pharmaceutical products (including generic pharmaceutical products);
rather, manufacturers submit bids that establish prices for generic pharmaceutical products and governments or
private entities select a winning bidder. These measures affect competition, marketing practices and the
reimbursement of drugs. See “—Changes in large volumes of demand arising from tender systems could lead to
_delivery bottlenecks or an unintentional increase in inventories.”_

The pharmaceutical industry is also characterized by continuous product development and technological change.
The entry of new players and products in any of our markets may make it difficult for us to increase our market
share, retain existing competitive positions or access new markets at all. If we fail to maintain our competitive
position, through either product development or effective marketing, or if any of our larger competitors engage in
pricing competition with us, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the New Notes.

**_Political instability and military action involving Ukraine, Belarus and Russia may affect our business and_**
**_results of operations._**

The Russian Federation initiated a military attack against Ukraine on February 24, 2022, following which Ukraine
declared a state of emergency and requested defense assistance from other countries.

In response to the ongoing armed conflict in Ukraine and related escalating geopolitical tensions, the United
States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions have imposed Sanctions on certain
Russian and Belarusian persons and entities including, but not limited to, certain financial institutions, energy,
media, technology and defence companies, as well as individuals associated with the Russian President and his
government. Various Russian banks have been excluded from the international financial communication system,

147


-----

SWIFT, and Sanctions have restricted transactions with government owned entities including the Central Bank of
the Russian Federation. Additional restrictions in relation to investment, financing, and providing professional
services to Russian entities have been introduced. The EU has also imposed Sanctions restricting the export and
import of many types of goods and services, increasing the number of Sanctions Restricted Persons and prohibiting
Russian Persons from participating in public tenders within the EU. Additional restrictions imposed by the U.S.,
among others, include a prohibition on “new investment” in Russia and in the Russian energy sector, new
restrictions on dealings in Russia’s sovereign debt; and other debt and equity restrictions with respect to certain
listed Russia state-owned enterprises.

The EU, U.S., and the UK, together with other jurisdictions may propose increasingly stringent Sanctions going
forward. The Russian Federation has responded with counter-measures. These developments have led to a high
degree of uncertainty in the global financial markets and in particular, volatility in the exchange rate of the Russian
ruble against other currencies, including the U.S. Dollar and the euro.

As of today, a significant portion of our operations is conducted in Russia:

- Our sales in Russia accounted for €488.7 million, or 15%, of our consolidated sales for the year ended
December 31, 2021. Our Russian sales increased by €42.7 million, or 21%, to €247.0 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2022 compared to €204.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021. During the
periods presented in this Exchange Offer Memorandum, our Russian operations were more profitable than
our business as a whole. The profitability of our Russian operations and thus the profitability of the Group
could be materially affected by any deterioration of the Russian economy.

- A currency sensitivity analysis (translation risk) on the basis of our foreign currency items as of December
31, 2021 showed that in the year ended December 31, 2021, an appreciation or devaluation of the euro
compared with the Russian ruble by 10% would have led to a change in our EBITDA of approximately €23.6
million (compared to €27.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020). The significant increase in
currency translation reserve as of June 30, 2022 was attributable in particular to the strong appreciation of the
Russian ruble since December 31, 2021 and to the resulting gain recognized in equity from currency
translation for companies that report in this currency. Additionally, there are increased risks for our Russian
subsidiaries related to the exchange rate of the Russian ruble to the euro and U.S. dollar, which is currently
unhedged. These risks are exacerbated by the decoupling of the Russian ruble from the international financial
system, which has materially impacted the cost and availability of hedging contracts, as well as the freezing
of currency reserves of the Russian state bank.

- We operate two manufacturing facilities and several sales entities in Russia, which together employed
approximately 2,100 full time equivalents as of June 30, 2022, of which approximately 400 full time
equivalents were employed in production. Our manufacturing sites in Russia continue to operate largely
without interruptions.

- The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Sanctions imposed in connection with Russia, certain Russian
entities and certain Russian individuals have introduced significant uncertainty about the ability and
willingness of Russia and the affected individuals to honor their foreign currency debt obligations and our
ability to engage in any related transactions consistent with applicable sanctions. This default risk in
combination with abnormally high foreign currency volatility in the capital markets and Sanctions against
Russia has resulted in Russia being excluded from the credit rating system. From an accounting perspective,
we are of the opinion that determining the country risk premium by applying the relevant credit rating is no
longer applicable for Russia and thus is no longer a viable indicator of the risk relating to our investment in
Russia into a local pharmaceutical company that is not affected by any of the Sanctions. The traditional
approach of IAS 36.A4-A6, where a single set of estimated cash flows is discounted with a Weighted Average
Cost of Capital (“WACC”) determined by country risk premiums (which we followed until January 1, 2022),
would thus lead to an inappropriate representation and measurement of assets.

For the interim period from January 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022, we therefore applied the expected cash flow
approach. Rather than discounting a single cash flow projection with a risk-adjusted WACC, we have taken
the uncertainty and risks induced by the Russia/Ukraine crisis into account in the cash flow projection of the
underlying Russian business operations in the form of several scenarios with varying probabilities of
occurrence. In developing the future cash flow scenarios for our Russian business, we considered the
following variables: the development of the foreign exchange rate of the Russian ruble versus the euro and
its translational and transactional effects; the Russian inflation rate and its effect on our cost of goods sold

148


-----

and services and operational expenditure; our ability to compensate for the inflationary tendencies by pricing
activities; the change in market demand and our market share as well as our resulting Marketing & Sales
activities. Based on these variables, we developed four scenarios and assigned each a probability of occurring,
which we determined based on expert interviews and analyses of financial market indicators:

(A) Scenario A (base case) with a probability of 55%: moderate ruble devaluation and inflation with
single-digit market contraction;

(B) Scenario B (downside case) with a probability of 25%: significant ruble devaluation and inflation and
double-digit market contraction;

(C) Scenario C (national bankruptcy case) with a probability of 15%: very significant ruble devaluation
and inflation and high double-digit demand contraction;

(D) Scenario D (expropriation case) with a probability of 5%: worst case with a full discontinuation of
the business and cash flows in Russia.

Based on the four different cash flow scenarios and their probability of occurrence, we have calculated a
probability-weighted cash flow which has replaced the originally-budgeted cash flows of the Russian business. In
turn, we eliminated the Russian country risk premium from the discount-rate considerations since the country
risks have been reflected in the cash flows of the underlying operational business activities. The aforementioned
approach has been applied consistently for all relevant areas, performing goodwill impairment, testing intangible
and tangible assets associated with our Russian business. The approach was unchanged for the remaining business,
including Ukraine, as a credit rating is still available to help determine a country risk premium.

- Although the applicable Sanctions do not preclude us from repatriating cash from Russia or transferring funds
to Russian bank accounts held with local branches of non-sanctioned international banks, more stringent
Sanctions, capital controls or other regulatory measures may be imposed in the future. Repatriation of cash
from Russia has historically required clearance from the Russian Central Bank. While clearances were
previously provided in the ordinary course, the Russian countermeasures since the invasion generally prohibit
loans and dividends to be made outside Russia and provide wide discretion to the Russian Central Bank in
providing clearances for such transfers. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain such
clearances and extract and expatriate any profits generated in our Russian business going forward, which
could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance and results of operations.

- We have recognized impairments amounting to €642.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022. The
impairments in the Russian market in the six months ended June 30, 2022 were primarily attributable to four
approvals for Specialty products (€15.9 million), seven approvals in the Consumer Healthcare division (€14.5
million) and one approval in Generics (€6.1 million), due to a mix of the increased interest rate and uncertain
future prospects for the Russian market. We also recognized impairments for intangible assets and tangible
assets in Ukraine due to the increase in the country market risk premium which led to a significant increase
in the country determined WACC. These included impairments for three approvals for Consumer Healthcare
products (€5.9 million) and for all tangible assets such as machines and equipment (€17.3 million).

We are currently reviewing all products manufactured by us and delivered to Russia in the context of the Sanctions
imposed (mainly by the EU and the U.S.). We primarily manufacture pharmaceuticals, medical devices and food
supplements, that are exempt from a number of Sanctions restrictions. As of the date of this Exchange Offer
Memorandum, exemptions from Sanctions restrictions in the form of permissive “general licenses” permit the
activities related to delivery and sale of pharmaceutical products, medical devices and food supplements to the
Russian Federation. This also applies to certain pharmaceutical products, medical devices and food supplements
that are manufactured in Russia by our manufacturing facilities for the Russian market. Additionally, local
manufacturing in Russia by our Russian affiliates and Russian employees is usually not subject to Sanctions where
there is no nexus to, for example, the U.S. or the EU. This is based on humanitarian aspects of our products, as
also reflected in Art. 25 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that
“Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family,
including food, clothing, housing and medical care…and the right to security in the event of … sickness…”. In
spite of this framework, we currently have potential operational bottlenecks in the supply of certain materials such
as spare parts and raw materials for our production facilities delivered by third parties to Russia, which could
significantly burden and restrict the production of our drugs in Russia. These bottlenecks are a consequence of
the Sanctions, which, in some cases, require prior approvals and/or are subject to other restrictions. We can provide
no assurance that authorities will grant such prior approvals. In addition, any lack of experience of suppliers
applying for such prior approvals or of the authorities processing the applications may result in substantial delays.
This could lead to increased costs and delays to procure the affected goods or alternative materials. There is also

149


-----

a risk that we may be unable to manufacture certain medicines at our production sites in Russia in the short- to
medium- term. In addition, the Sanctions and the enactment of the transport ban related Russian logistic companies
may result in delays in shipments of our finished products to Russia. There is no guarantee that the U.S. and other
countries will not revoke the general licenses that Persons rely upon to ship certain pharmaceuticals to Russia.
Further, it cannot be ruled out that our Russian operations could be indirectly affected by Sanctions in other
sectors. For example, Sanctions that affect the insurance sector may subsequently affect our ability to obtain or
retain insurance coverage. We currently have liability and D&O insurance in Russia and Belarus. However, our
marine & transport, property & business interruption and cybercrime insurances in Russia and Belarus, which we
otherwise maintain in ordinary course have lapsed and are in the process of being renewed. In addition, due to the
conflict, we currently do not have insurance cover in Ukraine. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain
renewal of these policies in Russia and Belarus or obtain insurance in Ukraine, which may leave us exposed to
these risks.

In response to U.S., EU and Sanctions imposed by other jurisdictions, Russia has also imposed countersanctions
on so-called “unfriendly” states (which includes EU member states). Sanctions or countersanctions imposed by
Russia could lead to a reduction in supply volumes or even a suspension of gas and oil deliveries, which would
have an impact on the operation of our production facilities in Europe and on our products supplied by third
parties, and could result in increased costs of production. Should additional Sanctions be introduced, the Russian
government could take further legal action, including confiscating assets and freezing foreign companies’
accounts. Measures may also include nationalizing foreign companies under state control, as well as the forced
sales of a company’s assets, or the forced insolvency as a consequence of ceasing business in Russia or in an
extreme case of business disruption due to the lack of required items and products imported from Western
countries. The measures even may include the expropriation of a company’s assets.

Consequently, the Russian countermeasures could particularly affect entities incorporated or domiciled in
“unfriendly” states, including European and U.S. companies. In particular, transport companies in the EU may no
longer be allowed to enter Russia. In addition, countersanctions issued by Russia against “unfriendly” states may
result in conflict of laws and blocking statutes and may, in an extreme case, impede or restrict our Russian
subsidiary from complying with the requirements of the Russian countermeasures.

As stated above, a number of Sanctions restrictions include specific exemptions in relation to the delivery of
certain pharmaceuticals, medical devices and food supplements, and the conflict in Ukraine has so far not had a
material impact on our Russian operations. We have specific procedures in place to ensure that all Russia-related
business activities, including our exports into Russia, comply with the applicable international, regional and
national regulations. We follow a risk-based approach, which means, for example, prior to entering into a contract
with a high-risk customer, we conduct due diligence (including software-based systematic screening) and obtain
documentation from them that verifies their identity (including their beneficial owners) as well as the identity of
their end-customers when they have been disclosed. We also tailor our contracts to the specific contractual partners
and export country, providing for specific payment terms and requiring specific guarantees. Additionally, in
response to the current conflict, we have established a crisis team to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable
laws, monitor impacts on our business in Russia and the Ukraine and model scenarios. We are also involved in
crisis relief efforts, including participating in emergency committees to provide logistics and accommodation to
refugees, as well as donating medicines to Medicines for Europe, an organization representing the generic
medicine industry in Europe, and money to the Red Cross.

While our Russian subsidiary has historically had enough cash and generates enough cash to operate, it may
require additional capital if its current funding is interrupted by current or future political instability, military
action or Sanctions. Such funding may be difficult to obtain, in light of prohibition on new investments in Russia
under applicable Sanctions.

We are in close contact with the procurement and supply chain teams of our Russian operations to monitor all
deliveries from us and by external parties on our behalf to Russia. We have implemented internal processes to
classify goods delivered to Russia with a risk-based approach, and our corporate compliance team monitors and
controls the release of goods destined for Russia. Goods being supplied by third parties on our behalf and which
are currently under restrictions due to approval or notification requirements are being monitored by our corporate
compliance team in close cooperation with the supplier to give support (e.g., letters are being prepared to give
evidence of humanitarian, medical and pharmaceutical purpose). Payments from our EU subsidiaries to Russian
banks are being closely monitored by our corporate treasury in collaboration with our corporate compliance team.
We have issued guidelines for procurement and supply chain and there are ongoing meetings and calls with all
relevant business areas and subsidiaries to give regular updates and discuss relevant topics or potential impacts
on the supply chain. However, in spite of the processes instituted by us, we cannot guarantee that we or other

150


-----

external parties supplying our products in Russia would be able to comply with approval or notification
requirements in all cases.

Our business operations in Ukraine do not represent a significant part of our consolidated sales or net income:

 - Our sales in Ukraine amounted to €33.3 million, or 1% of our consolidated sales for the year ended December
31, 2021.

 - We operate one manufacturing facility and carry out sales activities in Ukraine, which together employed
approximately 430 full time equivalents as of June 30, 2022. Our manufacturing and commercial activities
in Ukraine were largely put on hold after February 24, 2022, but our factory in Ukraine was put back into
operation in May 2022.

 - We recognized impairment losses on intangible and tangible assets in Ukraine for the six months ended June
30, 2022 as a result of the Russian invasion, which materially adversely affected our business prospects in
Ukraine as well as the market premium and cost of capital assumptions used in our impairment analysis,
including a €5.9 million impairment loss on three Consumer Healthcare products and a €17.3 million
impairment loss on tangible assets such as machines and equipment.

Ukraine has introduced a legislative measure (law No. 2271-IX), which may result in marketing authorization
applications being refused or existing authorizations being cancelled or suspended for those pharmaceutical
companies affiliated directly or indirectly with entities in Russia or Belarus or engaged directly or indirectly in
pharmaceutical manufacturing in Russia. Currently, the law provides the Ukrainian Ministry of Health with the
authority to decide on the refusal, cancellation or suspension of marketing authorizations on a case-by-case basis
and does not trigger any automatic consequences. Furthermore, there is no elaborate criteria laid down with respect
to the direct or indirect affiliation or manufacturing activity. However, in the event we are found to be covered by
the criteria laid down by Ukraine’s legislative measure, our existing marketing authorizations in Ukraine may be
cancelled or suspended and our marketing authorization applications in Ukraine may be refused.

We do not operate any manufacturing facility or own any assets in Belarus, but have a local marketing team,
consisting of about 40 full-time equivalents as of December 31, 2021.

Continuing or escalating military action and geopolitical tensions in the entire region of Russia, Ukraine and
Belarus could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and our results of operations to
the extent it has an impact on the macro-economic context in which we operate. There is also a risk that the U.S.,
UK and EU may further expand the scope of their Sanctions against Russia and that other countries will impose
similar or more severe Sanctions in the future. See “—We are subject to risks associated with cross border sales
_and purchases.”_

Our manufacturing facilities in Russia could be disrupted by the conflict with Ukraine or by other wars, political
unrest, terrorist activity or economic upheaval. Any such disruption could cause losses in efficiencies, delays in
shipments of our products and the loss of sales and customers, and insurance proceeds may not adequately
compensate us for our losses. Furthermore, our operations in Russia may be subject to risks arising from a less
stable legal and regulatory framework and less transparent enforcement of the law. This could result in, inter alia,
increased difficulty in enforcing contracts, collecting trade receivables, the imposition of additional regulations,
an increase in taxes or restrictions of the import of products. Due to the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, it is
conceivable that various regulatory obstacles could be introduced that could result in imports and exports between
Russia and the U.S., Europe, and other countries being significantly restricted or even banned. These regulatory
obstacles could range from additional permissions for import and export to direct Sanctions on certain goods. In
such cases, as stated above, delivery delays and subsequent supply bottlenecks, or even the impossibility of
supplying the Russian market with individual products, may occur. Any of these factors could potentially damage
our reputation or affect our sales and the operation of our manufacturing facilities, resulting in a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the New Notes.

In Russia and in all jurisdictions in which we operate, we are subject to stringent regulations for pharmaceutical
companies. Failure to comply with the applicable regulations can result in fines, unanticipated compliance
expenditures, the recall or seizure of products, the total or partial suspension of production or distribution, the
suspension of the review of our product applications, enforcement actions, injunctions and criminal prosecution,
as well as reputational harm, reduced sales and market share. While we believe that we are taking adequate
measures to mitigate our regulatory risk in Russia and elsewhere, there can be no assurance that, should regulatory

151


-----

scrutiny increase further, these measures will continue to be effective. In addition, continuing compliance with
increased regulatory scrutiny is likely to increase our operational costs.

**_We are exposed to changes in demand for our products due to economic, political and regulatory factors that_**
**_are beyond our control._**

Our results of operations have been, and continue to be, affected by conditions in the global economy. For
example, international conflicts, such as the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the political situation
in certain countries in which we operate, such as the United Kingdom, and the impact of the ongoing coronavirus
(“COVID-19”) pandemic, may adversely affect the macroeconomic environment. See “—Political instability and
_military action involving Ukraine, Belarus and Russia may affect our business and results of operations,”_ “—The
_result of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on our business”_
and “—Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely
_affected by the ongoing COVID-19 public health pandemic.” These events have influenced, and may continue to_
influence, the development of our sales in the relevant markets. While sales in our Generics and Specialty
divisions, which mostly comprise nondiscretionary prescription and specialty products, are less vulnerable to
adverse economic conditions, our results of operations in our Consumer Healthcare division, which mostly
comprises self-pay OTC products, is more sensitive. An economic downturn and lower household incomes can
significantly depress demand in the self-pay market, _i.e., the market for pharmaceutical products for which_
consumers are not reimbursed as part of their personal national health insurance plan.

We believe that we are particularly exposed to a deterioration in the Russian economy. The CIS region accounted
for €447.7 million, or 35%, of our Consumer Healthcare sales in the year ended December 31, 2021, and €614.0
million, or 19%, of total sales. As a result, Russia’s recent economic deterioration had, and any future downturn
(including as a result of the military conflict with Ukraine, existing and additional economic Sanctions, and the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic) may have, a particularly negative impact on our sales. In addition, the United
Kingdom accounted for €187.0 million, or 15%, of our Consumer Healthcare sales in the year ended December
31, 2021, and €266.3 million, or 8%, of consolidated sales. As a result, we believe we are also exposed to any
deterioration in the UK economy, and there can be no assurance that ongoing negotiations following Brexit (as
defined below) or other factors, including inflation and the COVID-19 pandemic, may not result in a decline in
the economic condition of the United Kingdom.

Our Generics division is also exposed to fluctuations in the economy to the extent economic, political and
regulatory factors induce cost containment reform measures in any country, which could affect reimbursement
rates and our sales of prescription drugs. For example, the sustained economic downturn in Spain resulted in a
number of cost containment measures in recent years. See “—Existing and future healthcare cost containment
_reform measures by government health authorities or government sponsored healthcare systems could adversely_
_affect our business” below._

Any of these factors, or others that we cannot anticipate, may adversely affect our business, results of operations
and financial condition and could adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations under the New Notes.

**_Global economic conditions, including inflation, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and_**
**_financial condition._**

Our business may be affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control, such as general macroeconomic
conditions, conditions in the global capital and credit markets, and other general political and economic
developments.

Mismatches between the supply and demand of goods and services, partially as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic and, more recently, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have contributed to a rise in global inflation in 2021
and the first half of 2022. To counter inflation, central banks have started increasing interest rates and are expected
to continue to raise interest rates through 2022 and potentially beyond. Policy tightening in markets across the
world, such as the United States, the United Kingdom and the EU, has already begun in order to counteract rising
inflation and the risk of capital outflows. Any slowdown in the global economic environment, together with any
reduction in governmental spending and the likely impact on the level of economic activity globally, could impact
our results of operations.

In particular, we have recently experienced and may continue to experience raw-material and wage inflation,
which we estimate in the six months ended June 30, 2022, accounted for a single-digit percentage increase in our
cost of goods sold. We expect high inflation to continue for the second half of 2022 and cannot assure you that

152


-----

we will be able to offset any impact of inflation to the same degree or at all in the future, which could adversely
affect our profitability and competitiveness.

Additionally, should the prices of materials used in our manufacturing process rise due to inflation or other
economic conditions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pass through such price
increases to customers. Any inability to pass price increases to customers to cover increases in our cost base could
negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We are subject to extensive governmental regulation, and changes in these regulations, or the failure by us or_**
**_any of our third-party suppliers to comply with these regulations, could harm our business._**

We are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving regulations. These regulations govern, among other
things, the development, authorization, manufacturing and procurement of contract manufacturing, wholesale
distribution and supply, pharmacovigilance and promotion of our products. See “Regulation.” While the
regulations in the European Union are to a certain extent streamlined, the regulatory environment outside the
European Union is fragmented and varies by country. Globally, we market our products in approximately 120
countries, mainly across Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States (“CIS”) region, the MENA region,
Asia, Australia and each of these countries may regulate these areas differently.

In our Generics division, we sell unbranded generic products mostly comprising prescription products. In most
countries, the pricing of prescription products is regulated either directly (for example, through statutory price
reductions) or indirectly (for example, through reference prices and reimbursement rates payable by the health
insurance system, mandatory discounts, terms and/or requirements concerning discounts, the creation of
framework conditions to stimulate market forces and competition). Pricing also may be influenced by
supranational regulations in the European Union. Any changes in these regulations or procedural rules, such as
those governing public procurement and tender processes, could reduce the profitability of individual products
and, in exceptional cases, could render the market introduction of a new product unprofitable.

The regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions where we operate rigorously monitor and enforce compliance with the
relevant regulations by pharmaceutical companies, and our operations are subject to periodic inspections by the
relevant regulatory authorities in our markets. As a manufacturer of pharmaceutical products, we are, for example,
subject to principles of good manufacturing practice (“GMP”) and good distribution practice (“GDP”), and
compliance with these principles is assessed by the competent regulators via site audits. See “Regulation—
_European Union—European Union Pharmaceutical Regulatory Regime—Manufacturing and Contract_
_Manufacturing” and “Business—Procurement, Production and Quality Management—Highest Quality and_
_Safety Standards.” Following these inspections, the relevant regulator may issue notices listing the conditions that_
inspectors believe may violate GMP, GDP or other applicable regulations, and warning letters that could modify
certain activities identified during the inspection. Failure to comply with the applicable regulations can result in
fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, the recall or seizure of products, the total or partial suspension of
production or distribution, the suspension of the review of our product applications, enforcement actions,
injunctions and criminal prosecution, as well as reputational harm, reduced sales and market share.

Moreover, we currently market four biosimilars and we have licensed additional biosimilars that are now in the
development phase. The production of biologics and biosimilar products is subject to particularly complex
regulations. Failure to comply with such regulations may lead to production failures, recalls or fines. In addition,
we could incur substantial remediation costs. If any of these risks materialize, our sales could be materially and
adversely affected.

While we believe that we are taking adequate measures to mitigate the regulatory risk, there can be no assurance
that, should regulatory scrutiny further increase, they will continue to be effective. In addition, continuing
compliance with increased regulatory scrutiny is likely to increase our costs. We also have affiliations, in licensing
agreements and other arrangements with third parties that depend on regulatory approvals of their processes and
products. These third parties are subject to similar regulatory compliance. If any of those third parties does not
comply with our regulatory requirements, we could be adversely affected if their non-compliance results in an
interruption in our supply of raw materials or ingredients or, in the case of any of our licensors, it hinders our
ability to produce our in licensed products.

Any failure by us or any of our third-party suppliers or licensors to comply with governmental regulations, or any
regulatory action taken against us, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the New Notes.

**_Existing and future healthcare cost containment reform measures by government health authorities or_**
**_government sponsored healthcare systems could adversely affect our business._**

In various countries where we operate, government health authorities provide healthcare at a low direct cost to
consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the government
sponsored healthcare system. The continuing increase in healthcare expenditure has therefore been the subject of
considerable government attention in many of the countries in which we operate, particularly as public resources
have been stretched by the global economic crisis. Furthermore, in recent years, the increasing average age of the
population and the associated increasing demand for pharmaceutical products has led to rising healthcare costs.

Increasing expenditure on healthcare has been the subject of considerable public attention. In recent years, many
countries across the globe have discussed or implemented a measure of healthcare reform. The primary focus of
these reforms was to introduce cost containment measures and optimize governmental healthcare spending,
particularly for prescription drugs, which account for a major part of our sales, particularly after certain constraints
on national budgets and increased state spending to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. Measures implemented
in line with these reforms are fragmented and vary by country. For example, the Russian government has released
a list of vital and essential pharmaceuticals (“VEP”) that are subject to mandatory price caps. Overpricing can
result in fines and other penalties. Certain European countries have introduced numerous austerity measures to
lower healthcare spending, including mandatory discounts, clawbacks and price referencing rules. In certain cases,
reimbursements for high priced drugs were refused. The United Kingdom and Germany introduced systems to
determine the cost effectiveness of drugs, which will decide the reimbursement level for a drug. In Spain the
government’s pricing and reimbursement policy is focused on cost containment measures as they attempt to reduce
their financial deficit, which has repeatedly resulted in price cuts, reductions to wholesale and retail margins and
cuts to the list of reimbursable drugs since 2000; we believe the pace at which these regulatory measures are
enacted has accelerated in recent years. The Spanish government has also enacted four royal decree laws since
2010 that have directly affected the pharmaceutical industry by means of price reductions for older pharmaceutical
products, mandatory rebates on drugs and medical devices, and limitations on the number of products eligible for
a reimbursement under the Spanish National Health Service. Certain countries also cut their healthcare
expenditure budgets or fixed them at a particular amount. Furthermore, mandatory price cuts were introduced in
respect of both generic and patented drugs. Many countries have implemented further healthcare cost containment
measures in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. See also “Regulation.”

While most of our Consumer Healthcare products are non-reimbursable OTC drugs, which are generally less
affected by the above measures, those measures may affect our Generics division, which mostly comprises
prescription products, and Specialty division in a number of ways. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price
that we receive for any Generics or Specialty products we currently distribute or will develop in the future. As a
result, we may be disincentivized from developing and marketing new products or from entering new markets.
Existing regulations that affect the prices of pharmaceutical and other medical products may also change before
our products are approved for marketing. Our products may not be considered cost effective or adequate thirdparty reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an adequate
return on our investment. The governments of the countries where we operate may, in the future, implement
further regulations that impose additional pressure on the price of pharmaceutical products, including as a result
of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Any of the factors described above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations and ability to perform our obligations under the New Notes.

**_Obtaining and maintaining necessary government approvals for manufacturing and marketing our products_**
**_is time consuming, and may not in each instance prove successful._**

We must obtain a marketing authorization and other regulatory certifications, licenses and approvals prior to
marketing or manufacturing new pharmaceutical products, which applies to all three of our divisions (Generics,
Consumer Healthcare, and Specialty). See “Regulation” and “—We are subject to extensive governmental
_regulation, and changes in these regulations, or the failure by us or any of our third-party suppliers to comply_
_with these regulations, could harm our business.” Although less onerous than for originator pharmaceutical_
companies, the process of obtaining marketing authorizations and other regulatory certifications, licenses and
approvals to manufacture and market pharmaceutical products is rigorous, time consuming and costly. Depending
on the country and therapeutic area, the issuance of an approval may take two years, or even longer. As the
authorization process is time consuming, we may be unable to realize the momentum for the launch of new
products, which may result in the loss of sales and market share. To the extent that we are unable to secure timely

154


-----

approvals for new products, we will depend on our existing products to maintain our sales. There can be no
assurance that these products will continue to remain competitive and generate sufficient sales over time.

There can be no assurance that we will obtain regulatory approval of any application we submit for the commercial
sale of a product in time, or at all. Delays in any part of the process or our inability to obtain or maintain regulatory
approval in respect of our products could adversely affect our operating results by restricting or delaying the
introduction of new products. If health or safety concerns arise with respect to a product, we may be forced to
withdraw it from the market and we could face legal action if any harm was caused by, or associated with, the use
of such product. For example, in September 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration informed us that, as a
result of its inspection of Synchron Research Services, all studies conducted by Synchron Research Services
would be rejected. Subsequently, the European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”) also reviewed the study data for
drugs approved in Europe. The EMA recommended the suspension of the marketing authorization of affected
generic drugs. In order to lift such a suspension, the affected distributing pharmaceutical company has to submit
alternative data to prove bioequivalence a valid basis for granting the marketing authorization. As of the date of
this Exchange Offer Memorandum, we sell a few generic drugs using marketing authorizations based on study
data provided by Synchron Research Services, and these authorizations might be affected by the suspension.
Although we currently do not consider any of them to be material, there can be no assurance that we will be able
to maintain all of our marketing authorizations. Furthermore, our products must be successfully registered in the
markets in which they are commercialized. For example, in the Generics division, a significant factor in the
development and approval of each product is the strict observance of commercial property rights, such as patents
and supplementary protection certificates.

Moreover, if we obtain regulatory agency approval for a drug, it may be limited with respect to the indicated uses
for which the drug may be marketed, which could in turn restrict our potential market for the drug. The discovery
of previously unknown problems with any of our pharmaceutical products could result in restrictions on the use
of a drug, including possible withdrawals of the drug from the market. Any delays in obtaining governmental
approval or authorization of new or existing products may have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the New Notes.

**_If we are unable to successfully develop, manufacture or commercialize new Generics products in a timely_**
**_manner, it could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to perform_**
**_our obligations under the New Notes._**

We are focused on generics and therefore only conduct limited proprietary research on new drugs. As a result, we
do not typically incur material research expenses. As a generics company, however, we incur development costs
in connection with marketing authorizations and the production of our new products, as well as other activities
that facilitate their commercialization. As a result, future results of operations depend, to a significant extent, on
our ability to develop, manufacture and successfully commercialize new products in a timely manner. The
development, manufacturing and commercialization process is time consuming. We must develop, test and
manufacture our products as well as successfully register them in each relevant jurisdiction. All our products must
meet and continue to comply with regulatory and safety standards in each of the markets in which they are to be
commercialized. There can be no assurance that the necessary marketing authorizations will be obtained in a
timely manner or at all and delays or the inability to obtain regulatory approval could adversely affect our business.
See “—Obtaining and maintaining necessary government approvals for manufacturing and marketing our
_products is time consuming, and may not in each instance prove successful.”_

Our products currently under development, if and when fully developed and tested, may not perform as expected
or may face greater than expected competition. In addition, our new products may be unable to achieve their
planned value. The successful development and manufacture of new products also depends on our ability to
secure, on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms, the required raw materials. In addition, there can
be no assurance that our new products will be accepted by the medical community in our target markets. See “—
_Our ability to market our products successfully depends, in part, upon the acceptance of the products not only by_
_end users, but also by independent third parties, including public health insurers, doctors and pharmacists,_
_depending on the jurisdiction in which we operate.” Finally, we are dependent on partnerships and joint ventures_
with third parties and we face the risk that some of these third parties may fail to perform their obligations under
the relevant contracts, thus reducing our ability to successfully develop, manufacture or commercialize new
products in a timely manner. See “—We are exposed to default or counterparty risks in connection with our
_operating business or as a result of contracting parties’ failure to meet their contractual obligations.”_

Should any of the above risks materialize, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the New Notes.

155


-----

**_We are subject to the risk of litigation and other claims._**

From time to time, we are involved in various litigation matters, including product liability claims, warranty
obligations claims, alleged violations of trade confidentiality and others. See “Business—Legal Proceedings,” “—
_Our reputation among end users and other market participants may suffer due to product liability or_
_contamination issues, whether actual or perceived” and “—Third parties may claim that we infringe their_
_proprietary rights, and as a result we may be prevented from manufacturing and selling our products.” When we_
determine that a significant risk of a future claim against us exists, we record provisions in an amount equal to
our estimated liability. However, there can be no assurance that our provisions will be sufficient to cover our
actual litigation costs. In addition, third-party litigation, including litigation related to competition law, anti-trust
law, tax law, patent law and the implementation of individual regulatory requirements in the provision of
healthcare at a national or supranational level, could have an indirect, materially adverse impact on us and the
market environment in which we operate.

In the Generics division, in particular, our business activities are associated with an increased risk of legal disputes
regarding commercial property rights (particularly patents and supplementary protection certificates), product
liability, warranty obligations, breaches of duty of care as well as the allegations of violations of company or trade
confidentiality. As a consequence of these legal disputes, in particular in the cases of such processes in the US,
damage claims, legal fees, a complete or temporary ban on the marketing of products or costs for recalls may be
incurred, irrespective of whether a damage claim ultimately exists. Furthermore, it may be difficult for us to
enforce our own claims under the law of a country where we undertake business at affordable costs and without
any material adverse effects on business in this country.

As of the date of this Exchange Offer Memorandum, we are involved in several pending general litigation cases.
Although we currently do not consider any of them to be material (either individually or in the aggregate), there
can be no assurance that we will be successful in defending ourselves in pending or future litigation claims or
similar matters under various laws or that product specific provisions will be sufficient to cover litigation costs.
Moreover, it may be difficult for us to obtain and enforce claims related to existing litigation under the laws of
certain countries in which we operate at affordable costs and without any materially adverse effects on our
business in such country. For example, in 2020 one of our subsidiaries in Russia was held liable by a Russian
court for damages of approximately €26 million in connection with its purchase of a product portfolio. The
Russian subsidiary filed an appeal against this decision in 2021, which ultimately led to an out-of-court settlement
signed by both parties, which was for a substantially lower amount than the originally-claimed €26 million.

Any of these events could result in considerable costs, including damages and legal fees, and a temporary or
permanent ban on the marketing of certain products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_Third parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights, and as a result we may be prevented from_**
**_manufacturing and selling our products._**

There has been substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry with respect to the manufacture, use and sale
of generic pharmaceutical products. These lawsuits relate to the validity and infringement of patents or the
proprietary rights of third parties. Originator and generic pharmaceutical companies are increasingly patenting not
only the relevant molecules or manufacturing processes relating to a final dosage product, but also the
formulations and production processes of active pharmaceutical ingredients.

While we believe that our products do not infringe in any material respect upon the commercial property rights of
other parties, we believe that patent infringement claims are typical of our industry. While we generally take great
care in ensuring that the new products we launch do not violate any intellectual property rights of third parties and
seek to refrain from selling products prior to the expiration of their patent protection, there can be no assurance
that an intellectual property infringement claim could not be brought against us and that we would not be found
to infringe on the commercial property rights of others. This is also due to the fact that, in certain countries, such
as Italy, patent applications are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued and, therefore, we may not be
aware of currently filed patents. In addition, even if our searches in the registers indicate that patents or other
intellectual property rights have expired, there can be no assurance that originators or other parties that previously
held such rights will not subsequently seek to restore their patents. If any application to restore intellectual
property rights were granted after we had started marketing a product, we could be found to violate such rights
and become liable for damages to their owners. We may also be subject to other legal action preventing or
impeding our future marketing of the subject product.

156


-----

We may also be subject to significant damages or an injunction preventing us from manufacturing, selling or using
some of our products in the event of a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement.
Furthermore, a significant third-party claim could result in management’s attention being distracted from current
operations.

The outcome of intellectual property-related proceedings could adversely affect, hinder, delay or prevent the
manufacture, use, marketing or sale of our products or processes. We may also be required to pay substantial
damages or change our product offerings or expend significant resources to develop non-infringing products or
processes. Any of the above could affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the New Notes.

We rely, in part, on license, collaboration and other agreements to develop our product portfolio. For example,
we occasionally enter into research and development partnerships with universities. The underlying collaboration
agreements may provide that we are granted the exclusive license to commercialize the final product. Our present
and future licenses, collaborations and other intellectual property related agreements may impose various
development, commercialization, funding, milestone, royalty, diligence, sublicensing, insurance, patent
prosecution and enforcement or other obligations on us. If we breach any of these obligations, or use the
intellectual property licensed to us in an unauthorized manner, we may be required to pay damages and our
licensors may have the right to terminate the license. If our license or other intellectual property related agreements
are terminated, we may be required to cease developing and commercializing drug candidates that are covered by
the licensed intellectual property.

In addition, our licensing, collaboration and other agreements under which we license intellectual property or
technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to
multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow
what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what
we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement. Moreover, if disputes over
intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing
arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize
the affected drug candidates. For example, such disputes may relate to: (i) the scope of rights granted under the
agreement and other interpretation related issues; (ii) the extent to which our technology and processes infringe
on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the agreement; (iii) the sublicensing of patent and
other rights under our collaborative development relationships; (iv) our diligence obligations under the agreement
and which activities satisfy those diligence obligations; (v) the inventorship and ownership of inventions and
know how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our
collaborators; (vi) the priority of invention of patented technology; and (vii) in the case of joint developments, the
ownership of intellectual property rights.

To help protect any proprietary know how we develop and any inventions for which patents may be unobtainable
or difficult to obtain, we may have to rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements. There can be
no assurance that all our employees, consultants, advisors and contractors who have access to our trade secrets
and confidential information will agree to enter into agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential
information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries
and inventions important to our business. Even where such persons entered into such agreements, these
agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information
in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of such information. If any
of our trade secrets, know how or other proprietary information is disclosed, the value of our trade secrets, knowhow and other proprietary rights would be significantly impaired and our business and competitive position would
suffer.

If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property or maintain the existing
intellectual property rights we have, we may have to abandon the development of the relevant program or drug
candidate, which could have a material adverse effect on our net assets, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Industrial action or adverse labor relations could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our_**
**_operating results._**

Our operations depend on employees who are parties to collective bargaining arrangements, works council
agreements and/or benefits from local applicable law, defined benefit plans, regulations or customs regarding
employee rights and benefits. If we are unable to maintain satisfactory employee relations, ensure the safety of

157


-----

our employees during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or other disease outbreaks, or negotiate acceptable labor
agreements in the future, results could include work stoppages, strikes or other industrial action or labor
difficulties (including higher labor costs) at any or all of our global facilities.

While we believe that we have good relations with unions and our employees generally, there can be no assurance
that our relations will not deteriorate and that we will not experience labor disputes in the future. Any of these
adverse labor situations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and ability to perform our obligations under the New Notes.

**_Our reputation among end users and other market participants may suffer due to product liability or_**
**_contamination issues, whether actual or perceived._**

Although generics companies, such as us, are engaged in the reproduction of pharmaceutical products and their
active pharmaceutical ingredients that are vetted by regulations and often have been in the market for ten or more
years, there is a risk that we may be liable to, or incur costs related to, liability claims if any of such companies’
products cause injury or are found to be unsuitable during their development, manufacture, sale or use. These risks
exists even with respect to products that have received, or may receive in the future, regulatory approval for
commercial use. Moreover, our products could contain contaminated substances that we have not identified during
our manufacturing process, and adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of these ingredients could
occur. We could also be subject to product liability claims as a result of defective raw materials we purchase from
third parties.

Product liability lawsuits could be costly to defend, and could result in reduced sales, substantial monetary awards
to clinical trial participants or customers, harm to our brand and reputation, the inability to commercialize products
that we develop and diversion of management’s time, attention and resources. Considerable sums in damages
have been awarded in certain countries against pharmaceutical companies due to physical harm allegedly caused
by the use of certain products. Product liability claims may force us to withdraw some of our products from the
market, thus creating the potential for further claims. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims
would likely result in negative publicity, decreased demand for any products that we may develop, injury to our
reputation and the suspension or withdrawal of clinical trials, and require us to incur significant legal fees. We
currently have insurance coverage for product liability claims. See “Business—Insurance.” However, such
insurance may not be sufficient to cover all or even a material part of a significant product liability claim.
Furthermore, at any time, insurance coverage may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

Our failure to successfully defend a product liability lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the New Notes.

**_Our ability to market our products successfully depends, in part, upon the acceptance of the products not only_**
**_by end users, but also by independent third parties, including public health insurers, doctors and pharmacists,_**
**_depending on the jurisdiction in which we operate._**

Our ability to market our products successfully depends, in part, on the acceptance of products by independent
third parties, including public health insurers, doctors, pharmacists, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, group
purchasing organizations, government representatives and other retailers, as well as end users. In our Consumer
Healthcare division, we rely, to a significant extent, on the strength of our brands and reputation and our
acceptance by third-party agents and distributors. Examples of our strongest brands across our Consumer
Healthcare division include Cardiomagnyl, Zoflora, Nizoral, Aqualor and Snup. Unanticipated side effects or
unfavorable publicity concerning any of our products or brands, or the brands of our in licensed products, could
have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve acceptance by prescribing physicians, managed care providers,
pharmacies and other retailers, customers and patients.

In addition to the strength of our brand and reputation, acceptance of any of our products among the medical
community depends upon a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. With respect to Generics
and prescription items in our Consumer Healthcare and Specialty divisions, these factors include the following:

- acceptance by payors, physicians, pharmacists and end customers of each product as an effective treatment;

- whether a physician is receptive to our product and how quickly the physician adopts it as an accepted
treatment;

- the product’s price;

158


-----

- the product’s perceived advantages and disadvantages relative to competing products or treatments;

- the prevalence and severity of side effects; and

- adequate reimbursement by third parties, such as insurance companies.

If our products have received a marketing authorization from the regulatory authorities but do not achieve an
adequate level of acceptance by independent third parties, we may be unable to generate sufficient or any sales
from these products to make them profitable. If our products fail to maintain significant market acceptance, it
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to
perform our obligations under the New Notes.

**_If we or our suppliers encounter problems manufacturing products or cease to manufacture products, our_**
**_business could suffer._**

We strive to deliver high quality pharmaceutical products to our customers. The manufacture of our products is
highly exacting and complex due, in part, to strict regulatory requirements governing their manufacture. We rely
on complex machinery and information technology systems to support our manufacturing processes, as well as
internal and external communications with respect to supplies, quality control and distribution. Problems may
arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific
protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials and environmental factors. If problems are severe, we may
be forced to temporarily suspend all or part of our production until the problems are rectified. Any ongoing or
future measures taken by countries in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including severe restrictions
on movement, may prevent our employees, contractors and suppliers from conducting business activities, which
may disrupt manufacturing at our facilities around the world as well as our supply chains and, in turn, may
adversely impact our ability to source raw materials in time, or at all, and to meet the demand for our generic,
consumer healthcare and specialty medicines. Any of the foregoing are likely to result in increased costs, lost
sales, damage to customer relations, failure to perform existing contracts, time spent investigating the cause,
remedial costs and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. In addition,
where problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, we may be forced to recall
products from the market. For example, complying with a directive by the competent European authorities, we
recalled all affected batches containing the Valsartan active ingredient that were supplied by our Chinese supplier
in July 2018. We also proceeded with a second recall in September 2018, due to the contamination of a few
batches at the production facilities of Hemofarm AD. In certain cases, we may face product liability claims and
incur respective costs. See “—Our reputation among end users and other market participants may suffer due to
_product liability or contamination issues, whether actual or perceived.”_

The facilities used to manufacture our products are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities to
assess compliance with the relevant principles of GMP. See “—We are subject to extensive governmental
_regulation, and changes in these regulations, or the failure by us or any of our third-party suppliers to comply_
_with these regulations, could harm our business.” While we manufacture most of our products, others are_
manufactured by our contract manufacturing partners. Although we are ultimately responsible for ensuring that
our products are manufactured in accordance with the principles of GMP and believe that we diligently monitor
our suppliers’ compliance within the applicable requirements, we do not control the day to day activities of, and
we are dependent on, the contract manufacturing partners for their compliance with GMP requirements. If we or
any of our suppliers were to violate the applicable principles of GMP, we or such supplier could be fined, and the
competent regulator could impose a complete shutdown of such supplier’s noncompliant manufacturing plant. As
a result, we could become subject to a supply shortage with respect to the products we source from the sanctioned
supplier. If our inventories of these products turn out to be insufficient, this could adversely affect our sales. For
example, in June 2018, our Serbian subsidiary Hemofarm AD received notice of an impurity detected in one of
the active ingredients (Valsartan) used in our production. This active ingredient was supplied by one of our
Chinese suppliers who has now been sanctioned, and therefore we still may face the risk of a shortage in the
supply of Valsartan. As a result, we may potentially not be able to meet the obligations in our own delivery
contracts and may be liable for damages to our customers. In particular, our German discount agreements provide
for contractual penalties in the event we fail to perform our obligations in full or at the time contemplated by the
agreement. Although we may have recourse against our suppliers, our recovery may be subject to contractual or
equitable limitations as well as the solvency of our suppliers and be insufficient to offset the damages payable to
our customers. If our manufacturing partners or we cannot successfully manufacture materials that conform to our
specifications and the strict requirements of the relevant regulatory authorities, our manufacturing contractors and
we will not be able to secure or maintain regulatory approval for our respective manufacturing facilities. If a

159


-----

regulatory authority does not approve a facility for the manufacture of our products or if it withdraws any such
approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities. Although we carry out compliance
checks, the occurrence or suspected occurrence of production not in line with our specifications or regulatory
requirements can lead to lost inventories, and in some cases product recalls and enforcement action, with
consequential damage to our reputation and the risk of product liability. The investigation and remediation of any
identified problems can cause manufacturing delays, substantial expense, lost sales and the delay of new product
launches.

Any of the risks described above may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the New Notes.

**_Our business could be adversely affected if we incur significant integration costs with respect to any of our_**
**_bolt-on acquisitions, if we fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions or if we are unable to enforce claims_**
**_relating to a breach of the representations and warranties provided in connection with such acquisitions._**

In the past, we have grown through a combination of organic development and acquisitions, and we intend to
continue this combination in the future. Examples of our acquisitions in 2018 include the acquisition of the rights
to the anti-dandruff shampoo Nizoral in Europe and the MENA region, the purchase of trademark rights to Hedrin
in Belgium, Spain and Portugal, the product rights for APO go in Germany and Scandinavia, the acquisition of
the majority stake in Bioceuticals, a German manufacturer of the active ingredient and finished product
erythropoietin, being marketed to both third-party customers and STADA sales companies, the repurchase of all
European trademark rights to Ladival, and the acquisition of Ketodol. Examples of acquisitions in 2019 include
the acquisition from GlaxoSmithKline, through our British subsidiary Thornton & Ross, of five skincare brands
and a pediatric cough remedy in Europe as well as selected markets in APAC and Latin America, and the
acquisition of Biopharma’s pharmaceutical prescription and consumer health business in Ukraine. In 2020, we
completed the Takeda Acquisition through which we acquired the Takeda CIS Assets, a portfolio of selected
products sold in, inter alia, Russia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan and the Walmark
Acquisition, through which we acquired a leading manufacturer of consumer in Eastern Europe headquartered in
the Czech Republic. In 2020, we also acquired a portfolio of 15 well-established CHC brands from
GlaxoSmithKline and Lecigon through the acquisition of Lobsor, its Swedish owner. In 2021, we acquired 16
well-established local consumer healthcare brands from Sanofi, predominantly in European countries such as
France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain.

Acquisitions are part of our strategy, and we intend to selectively explore strategic acquisitions in the global
generics and OTC markets, with a focus on target companies and/or pharmaceutical assets that allow us to leverage
our existing platform and realize meaningful synergies.

Growth through acquisitions entails certain risks, including the risk of a failure to realize the expected benefits of
the acquisitions and incurrence of unexpected risks and obligations. While we conduct due diligence in preparation
for each acquisition, it is possible that legal, tax and operational risks of the respective target, some of which may
be unknown or undisclosed to us at the time of the acquisition, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and
issues relating to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, may materialize, have more severe
consequences than expected or increase the costs for the integration of a target. In addition, we could become
liable for overdue payables of a target or acquired company to suppliers or employees that are not currently known
to us or we could become subject to historic tax or pension liabilities of which we are not currently aware of and
we may underestimate historic or future tax or pension liabilities in relation to target or acquired companies. In
conducting our due diligence for the acquisition of a target, we may be required to rely on external resources,
including public information, information provided by the relevant vendor and information from third-party
consultants and advisers. For example, in connection with the Takeda Acquisition and the Walmark Acquisition
we were required to rely on information provided by the Takeda and Walmark vendors. There can be no assurance
that the due diligence we undertook in connection with these or other acquisitions has revealed or highlighted all
relevant facts necessary or helpful in evaluating these or other acquisitions. Any such unknown or previously
underestimated liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the New Notes.

In addition, acquisitions are also subject to the risk of overvaluation of the target and thus to the payment of
consideration greater than the target market value. Also, we may be unable to evaluate the scale of a potential
acquisition, which may result in being unable to allocate proper resources to execute the acquisition and
subsequent integration efficiently.

160


-----

The success of our acquisition strategy is dependent, among other things, on the successful integration of the
products and businesses we acquire at the expected costs, and their subsequent expansion into new markets or
into the existing markets in which we operate. Such integration and expansion require substantial time and focus
from management and may put a strain on our management resources, distracting our managers from their regular
tasks and require additional management resources to be deployed, especially where a large scale acquisition is
involved, which could adversely affect their ability to operate our business. Although we believe that our current
managerial, administrative, technical and financial resources are capable of supporting our recent and proposed
future expansion, there can be no assurance that our existing resources will be sufficient for this purpose, or that
we will be able to acquire the necessary additional resources on commercially acceptable terms or at all. In
addition, we may be unable to deploy sufficient resources to integrate a large-scale acquisition, which may result
in us being unable to realize desired synergies, operational efficiencies and cost savings. We may not be able to
realize these measures, either in the amount or within the timeframe that we currently anticipate, and the costs of
achieving these measures may be higher than what we expect. Our ability to realize such operational efficiency
and cost savings measures may be affected by a number of factors, including increases in expenses related to such
acquisitions. These factors, individually or in the aggregate, may offset the expected cost savings from the
acquisitions. There is also a risk that key employees of companies we acquire or key employees necessary to
successfully commercialize products and technologies that we acquire, may seek employment elsewhere,
including with our competitors. Any failure to acquire, maintain and deploy adequate management, sales,
administrative, technical and financial resources to support our expansion could undermine our acquisition
strategy.

In addition, our acquisitions of target companies or product portfolios may be subject to regulatory approval.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for our future acquisitions without
unreasonable expenses and within a reasonable time period or at all.

Our failure to integrate acquired businesses and products, or to realize the intended synergies, may prevent us
from obtaining the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create, or could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the New
Notes.

In addition, we may not be able to enforce claims relating to a breach of the representations and warranties
provided in connection with the acquisition of a target and our ability to recover losses suffered as a result of such
a breach may be limited. In connection with the Takeda Acquisition and Walmark Acquisition, the respective
vendors have given certain customary representations and warranties and indemnities. Nonetheless, third parties
could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities The Takeda and Walmark vendors have agreed to retain,
and we may not be able to enforce any claims against the Takeda and Walmark vendors relating to breaches of
these representations and warranties. The liability of the vendors under these agreements is very limited.
Moreover, even if we are able to eventually recover any losses resulting from a breach of these representations
and warranties, we may temporarily be required to bear these losses ourselves. In addition, if the Takeda and
Walmark vendors become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of
the vendors’ breach may be limited by the liquidity of the vendors or the applicable laws governing applicable
bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of such breach of applicable representations and warranties, we could incur
losses which could in turn adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_Our operations may be disrupted by accidents, equipment malfunctions or other unexpected events._**

Although we believe that we have adopted and maintained adequate safety precautions, if one or more of our
production facilities were to suffer a serious accident, breakdown, equipment malfunction or other unexpected
event, part of our production capacity could be jeopardized and our sales and net income would be materially
adversely affected until we repair or find a replacement for any such facility or machinery. Any of these events
could also result in a decrease of the market shares we currently hold in the relevant markets in which we operate
or with respect to the products we manufacture. While we believe that our production facilities maintain sufficient
insurance to cover any such property and other asset damages, depending on the risk and type of asset or property
insured, any losses related to a serious accident, equipment malfunction or other unexpected event could exceed
the amount of this coverage, and subsidiaries whose business solely consists of the management of intellectual
property rights and the receipt of royalties do not normally carry business interruption insurance at all. In addition,
the refurbishment or reconstruction of any of our production facilities or the construction of new facilities could
be subject to regulatory approval by the competent health authorities of the jurisdictions in which they are located
as well as the health authorities of some or all of the jurisdictions to which products from such facilities are
exported, which could result in significant delays in the resumption of product manufacturing. If any of the above

161


-----

were to materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and ability to perform our obligations under the New Notes.

**_Accidental contamination, noncompliance with environmental, health and safety laws or environmental,_**
**_health and safety litigation or liability, could adversely impact our business and operating results._**

Our product development and manufacturing processes involve the use of chemicals and include hazardous or
toxic materials. These programs and processes expose us to risks of accidental contamination, events of
noncompliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulatory enforcement, personal injury, property
damage, and claims and litigation resulting from such events. If an accident occurs, or if contamination is
discovered, we could be liable for cleanup obligations, damages or fines, which could have an adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the New Notes.
We are currently not aware of any material contamination incidents or material noncompliance with
environmental, health and safety laws.

The environmental laws of many jurisdictions in which we operate may impose potential obligations to clean up
contaminated sites. These obligations may relate to sites that we acquire, own or operate, which we formerly
owned or operated, or for which we may otherwise have retained liability or where waste from our operations was
disposed. Were such environmental cleanup obligations to arise they could significantly reduce our operating
results. In particular, any financial accruals that we may make for these obligations might be insufficient if the
assumptions underlying the accruals proved to be incorrect, or if we are held responsible for additional
contamination.

Stricter environmental, health and safety laws and enforcement policies could result in substantial costs and
liabilities for us, and could result in handling, manufacture, use, reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants being
subjected to more rigorous scrutiny by relevant regulatory authorities than is currently the case. Compliance with
these laws could result in significant capital expenditures, as well as other costs, thereby potentially harming our
business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the New Notes.

**_Failure to renew agreements with our material suppliers and wholesale customers on acceptable terms or the_**
**_termination of such agreements by material suppliers or wholesalers could harm our business._**

Although we have a large number of suppliers and customers and believe that our business is not materially
dependent on any single one of them, failure to renew contracts with material suppliers, such as suppliers of active
pharmaceutical ingredients, equipment (including, for example, medical devices) or other items and material
customers, such as hospitals, pharmacies and drugstores could negatively impact our business. In addition, some
of our major supply and wholesale contracts are subject to change of control provisions that may grant the
respective counterparties the right to terminate the relevant contracts as a result of a change of control, which in
certain but not all contracts may shorten the termination or contract period originally contemplated under the
contract. At the end of a contract’s term, which may be accelerated as a result of a change of control termination,
these suppliers or wholesalers have a choice to either renegotiate their contract with us, increase or decrease its
scope (with our consent), seek out our competitors to provide the same or similar services or cease outsourcing
the relevant activity. Whenever a contract expiries or is due for renewal, suppliers and wholesalers may seek a
price adjustment from us. In addition, these parties may seek a price adjustment when their business experiences
significant volume changes. Furthermore, certain suppliers or wholesalers may seek to increase prices previously
agreed with us due to pricing competition or other economic needs or pressures being experienced by the supplier
or the wholesaler. If our contracts are terminated either by a material supplier or wholesaler (for example, as a
result of a change of control event being triggered) or not extended upon their termination, if our material suppliers
or wholesalers shift business away from us, or if we are unsuccessful in retaining high renewal rates and contract
terms that are favorable to us, this can cause delays and may have a material adverse effect on our business and
our respective operating divisions, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations
under the New Notes.

**_Changes in large volumes of demand arising from tender systems could lead to delivery bottlenecks or an_**
**_unintentional increase in inventories._**

Tender systems for generic pharmaceutical products have been implemented (by both public and private entities)
in a number of significant markets in which we operate, such as Germany, in an effort to achieve lower prices.
Under such tender systems, governments or private entities do not directly set the prices of pharmaceutical
products (including generic pharmaceutical products) but manufacturers submit bids that establish prices for

162


-----

generic pharmaceutical products and governments or private entities select a winning bidder. These measures
affect competition, marketing practices and the reimbursement for drugs.

Initially, the tender system in Germany resulted in intense price based competition, which pushed the pricing of
generic products to a marginal cost level. Although competition subsequently decreased and margins have
partially recovered, as many smaller competitors proved unreliable in terms of their ability to fulfill large orders,
there can be no assurance that new entrants will not intensify the level of competition again. Moreover, tender
systems implemented by governmental institutions or public health insurance organizations could determine
fluctuations in national markets, leading to changes in large volumes in the demand for pharmaceutical products.
These fluctuations have a direct consequence on our business. Even if we undertake great efforts to avoid delivery
bottlenecks or an unintentional increase in inventories by way of scenario calculations and specific operational
positioning of the respective supply chain, these events cannot generally be ruled out due to our extensive
portfolio. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations
and ability to perform our obligations under the New Notes.

**_Any significant increases in the cost of active ingredients or auxiliary materials used in manufacturing our_**
**_products or their availability could adversely impact our profit margins and operating results._**

Affordable, high quality active ingredients or auxiliary materials are essential to our business due to the nature of
the products we manufacture. Active ingredients and auxiliary materials are generally available from multiple
suppliers and often sourced locally. We acquire these ingredients and auxiliary materials directly from the
suppliers or enter into contracts with manufacturers producing the pharmaceutical products. Increased prices,
rationing or shortages as well as fluctuations in prices can occur. In some cases, we manage these risks through
mechanisms aimed at reducing our financial exposure, such as price escalation clauses (which link procurement
prices to current selling prices) and specific procurement prices for specific sales volumes. However, there can be
no assurance that rapid cost increases or extended supply shortages will not occur and adversely impact our
financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the New Notes.

**_We are subject to risks associated with cross-border sales and purchases._**

We market our products in approximately 120 countries globally, with a direct presence in about 35 countries
from which we carry out our local and export sales. Due to differing regulatory regimes, certain of our products
may be classified as Generics in some countries and as Consumer Healthcare or Specialty in others. Different
classifications could also result in pricing differences, which may be material. Cross-border operations are subject
to risks, including but not limited to:

- the inadequate protection of intellectual property;

- difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws,
regulations and treaties, some of which are subject to change;

- legal uncertainties regarding, and timing delays associated with, customs procedures, tariffs, import or
export licensing requirements and other trade barriers;

- differing local product preferences and product requirements;

- increased difficulty in collecting delinquent or unpaid accounts;

- the risk of loss at sea or other delays in the delivery of products caused by transportation problems;

- differing tax regimes; and

- economic Sanctions and restrictions on exports and other transfers of goods (see “—Our international
_sales and operations increase the risks associated with economic and trade Sanctions imposed by the_
_European Union and other jurisdictions”)._

Any of these factors, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely affect our operating results.

163


-----

**_We are exposed to risks related to conducting operations in many different countries._**

We develop, manufacture and market a broad range of generic and branded pharmaceutical products that are
available in approximately 120 countries, including the MENA region, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Russia, Spain,
Serbia, France, Switzerland, Vietnam and the United States. Both our operations and those of our local sales and
business partners in these countries may be subject to the following risks: changes in the rate of economic growth;
unsettled political or economic conditions; expropriation or other governmental actions; social unrest, war,
terrorist activities or other armed conflicts; bribery and corruption; national and regional labor strikes; confiscatory
taxation or other adverse tax policies; the deprivation of contract rights; trade regulations affecting the production,
pricing and marketing of products; anti-trust risks; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; restrictions
on the repatriation of income or capital; exchange controls; inflation; currency fluctuations and devaluation; the
effect of global environmental, health and safety issues on economic conditions, market opportunities and
operating restrictions; and changes in financial policy and the availability of credit.

In the past, we identified and investigated alleged misconduct in our Russian operations. The alleged activity
included overpayment for advertisement and supplies, improper distribution of gift cards to pharmacies and
conflict of interest of a few local top managers in certain procurement and distribution arrangements as well as
the registration of intellectual property rights in the name of third parties when it was possible to register such
rights on behalf of our Russian subsidiary. We conducted an internal investigation into these matters and retained
external advisers. As a consequence of our findings, certain employees were dismissed and a new management
team was installed, and relevant processes and controls were redesigned to address the compliance violations
identified. We identified approximately €24.5 million of funds that were potentially misdirected over a period of
time in these schemes. The case has since been closed. We introduced additional processes and internal controls
and strengthened our Russian compliance team following this investigation.

We also from time to time receive whistleblower complaints from our employees and third parties. These
complaints are often vague and ambiguous and have in the past occasionally proven to be false. In addition, some
allegations are unspecific without any concrete information or evidence. As a result, whistleblower complaints
oftentimes require substantial preliminary assessments of credibility before they can be progressed and
investigated to mitigate the risk of liability for false allegations. Although we thoroughly evaluate whistleblower
complaints as a matter of urgency, there is a risk that the alleged wrongdoing continues until we have completed
our initial assessment, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of
operations and prospects.

In addition, we or any of our local business partners may be subject to legal proceedings regarding bribery and
corruption in these countries, and we are unable to ensure or monitor the lawful conduct of our business partners’
operations, though we try to mitigate this risk by having anti bribery provisions in our contractual arrangements
and structural measures such as compliance trainings and audits to verify adherence to our compliance standards.
These factors could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our
obligations under the New Notes.

**_The pricing of cross-border transactions is often the subject of negotiation with tax authorities, and any_**
**_adjustments imposed may lead to the greater or double taxation of profits._**

Most national tax authorities follow the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development or United
Nations guidelines when considering the arm’s length nature of cross border pricing of goods and services.
Adjustments made by a national tax authority may not lead to a corresponding adjustment in the other tax
jurisdiction. Also, even where a corresponding tax adjustment is allowed, national tax rates may be different and
may therefore increase our overall burden of taxation. Our cross border trade is increasing and, although we
benchmark our intercompany pricing regularly, the risk of an adverse adjustment will require constant monitoring,
which may require a substantial amount of management resources. Potential discrepancies in the adjustments
made by the tax authorities in certain jurisdictions may result in us facing an increased tax burden.

**_Our international sales and operations increase the risks associated with economic and trade Sanctions_**
**_imposed by the European Union and other jurisdictions._**

Economic Sanctions and restrictions on exports and other transfers of goods have in the past been imposed on
companies engaging in certain types of transactions with specified countries in which we do business, including
but not limited to Russia, Lebanon, Yemen, Sudan, Myanmar, Libya and Iran. Although pharmaceutical products
are generally excluded from the scope of Sanctions, our exports and transfers could be impacted by such Sanctions,
which would limit our ability to trade with sanctioned individuals and/or sanctioned countries and create practical

164


-----

complications for our exports, especially in terms of our interaction with banks and receiving payments from
sanctioned countries. For example, the competent authorities could require banks to withhold payments due to us
from sanctioned customers or countries. The European Union and other countries have also enacted Sanctions
that prohibit transactions by their citizens and domiciled entities involving certain specially designated individuals
and entities from sanctioned countries or participating in sanctioned activities including but not limited to
terrorism and drug trafficking. In addition, the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom and certain
other countries have recently imposed Sanctions against Russia in connection with the armed conflict in Ukraine.
See “—Political instability and military action involving Ukraine, Belarus and Russia may affect our business
_and results of operations.”_

The terms of legislation and other rules and regulations that establish Sanctions regimes are often broad in scope
and difficult to interpret. Neither our affiliates nor we are currently the target of any such Sanctions and we have
adopted policies and procedures designed to comply with applicable sanction regulations. However, these
regulations and their enforcement could potentially affect our sales in the affected countries and force us to change
or abandon our growth plans. In addition, failure to comply with such regulations could result in significant fines.

Any of the foregoing economic and trade Sanctions could result in a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the New Notes.

**_The result of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on our_**
**_business._**

The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European
Union following the national referendum in June 2016 (“Brexit”), has created lingering uncertainty about the
future relationship between the United Kingdom, one of our current markets, the European Union and its
remaining member states, and may constitute an additional risk for the financial markets and the European
economy. While the European Union and the United Kingdom agreed a comprehensive, zero-tariff, zero-quota
free trade agreement, which came into force provisionally on January 1, 2021, Brexit has led to increased customs,
health and safety checks at the borders of the United Kingdom and the European Union as well as a lack of haulage
and other qualified supply chain and logistics workers, which has delayed and disrupted the movement of goods
between the European Union and the United Kingdom. Future developments might also affect our ability to
maintain the current level of sales in the United Kingdom, accounting for €266.3 million, or 8%, of our
consolidated sales in the year ended December 31, 2021. Moreover, Brexit-related changes could affect our supply
chain by causing potential delays in the supply of our products across the European border or in the storage of
stock of our products in the United Kingdom before their redistribution in the European Union. Given the lack of
comparable precedent, it is unclear what long-term financial, trade and legal implications Brexit will have and
whether, and to what extent, our business could be affected. In addition, certain political parties in Scotland are
currently pushing for a second referendum on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom, which may lead
to additional uncertainty and may affect our business activities in Scotland and other parts of the United Kingdom.
These and similar events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely_**
**_affected by the ongoing COVID-19 public health pandemic._**

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had, and any possible future outbreaks could have, an adverse effect on
us. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the reactions of governmental and other authorities to contain, mitigate or
combat the pandemic, have severely restricted the level of economic activity worldwide, and have impacted, and
are expected to continue to impact, our operations. Further, the nature, extent and duration of the impact of the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or any future disease or adverse health condition is highly uncertain and beyond
our control. In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many governments have taken preventative or
protective actions, such as imposing lockdowns, curtailing travel, imposing school closures, prohibiting mass
gatherings, mandating remote working, and in some countries, limiting the ability to access production facilities
and office buildings. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused significant economic dislocation in many of the
countries in which we operate and sell our products, which has resulted in an unprecedented slowdown in
economic activity and a related increase in unemployment. Were a recession to occur as a result of the economic
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or otherwise, we cannot predict the length of such recession or the short- and
long-term impact it may have on the global economy or our business specifically. Resurgences or further outbreaks
of the COVID-19 pandemic are also likely to occur. We cannot predict when or where any further outbreaks may
occur, their duration, how far into the future we may experience outbreaks nor can we predict with any certainty
the impacts of such subsequent outbreaks, including the impacts of future national or local lockdowns or other

165


-----

measures implemented by national and/or local authorities. Any or all consequences of outbreaks may have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

The pharmaceutical industry continues to face major challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had
an impact on overall economic growth, including the development of the healthcare market, with effects on each
of our Business divisions. For instance, due to lockdowns as well as strict social distancing and hygiene
regulations, demand for cough and cold medicines was very low in early 2021. Further, there were fewer patient
visits to hospitals, physicians and pharmacies, with lower demand for chronic disease medications. Given evolving
government policies and the emergence of new variants of COVID-19, there may be further impacts on the
economies or the consumer purchasing power of the countries where we operate.

It remains to be seen whether mutations of COVID-19 (particularly the omicron variant) will cause the pandemic
to turn into an epidemic or if it will promote the emergence of other novel mutations that will necessitate further
development of vaccines. The cyclical pandemic and the associated restrictions continue to have a significant
impact on the global economy and thus also on our business operations. We have faced and could continue to
face, slower deliveries of active ingredients and products, fewer contacts with physicians and pharmacists and
lower consumer purchasing power. This could lead to a continued product shortages and lower sales volume with
corresponding impacts on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Outbreaks of COVID-19 have had and could have an impact on availability of staff at our facilities and offices.
To reduce incidences of infection of our employees, we have adapted our comprehensive measures we introduced
at our sites in 2020 (such as rapid test stations, temperature control, mask wearing, social distance rules) in
accordance with the latest scientific evidence, the incidence of infection and the regulatory requirements in the
different countries. However, these actions may not fully mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our
business, or adequately protect against any outbreaks of COVID-19 at our facilities and offices.

Any of the foregoing, including any resulting deterioration in general economic conditions or changes in consumer
behavior, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To
the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of
operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors”
section.

**_Our sales and profits from generic pharmaceutical products may decline as a result of competition, both from_**
**_other pharmaceutical companies and as a result of increased governmental pricing pressure._**

Our generic products face intense competition. Prices of generics typically decline, especially as additional generic
pharmaceutical companies (including low cost generic producers based in China and Vietnam) receive approvals
and enter the market for a given product and competition intensifies. Consequently, our ability to sustain our sales
and profitability on any given product over time is affected by the number of new companies selling such product
and the timing of their approvals.

In addition, intense pressure from government healthcare authorities, particularly in highly regulated European
markets, to reduce their expenditures on prescription drugs has resulted in lower pharmaceutical pricing, causing
decreases in sales and profits.

Furthermore, brand pharmaceutical companies continue to defend their products vigorously. For example, brand
companies often sell or license their own generic versions of their products, either directly or through other generic
pharmaceutical companies (so called “authorized generics”). No significant regulatory approvals are required for
authorized generics, and brand companies do not face any other significant barriers to enter into such market.
Brand pharmaceutical companies may also seek to delay introductions of generic equivalents by a variety of
commercial and regulatory tactics (such as obtaining and enforcing new patents on drugs whose original patent
protection is about to expire, questioning the quality and bioequivalence of generic pharmaceutical products,
developing controlled release or other slightly modified versions, which often reduce demand for the generic
version of the existing product for which we are seeking approval, changing product claims and product labeling,
developing and marketing OTC versions of brand products that are about to face generic competition or trying to
extend the duration of their patents). These actions may increase the costs and risks of our efforts to introduce
generic products and may delay or prevent such introduction altogether.

**_Increased energy costs or disruptions in energy supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business,_**
**_financial condition and results of operations_**

Our business is dependent on the steady supply of significant amounts of energy, in particular electricity and
natural gas. In addition, energy costs impact the price at which we are able to access shipping services. Energy
costs are affected by various factors, including the availability of supplies of particular sources of energy, energy
prices and regulatory decisions. In particular, prices for oil, gas and electricity have been volatile in recent years.
Crude oil prices, for example, have historically exhibited significant volatility and have hit their highest levels
since 2014 in early 2022 after having reached negative levels during 2020 as a result of a shortage in storage
capacity. The logistics industry is and may continue to be required to increasingly use higher quality fuels on an
increasing number of its services due to changing environmental requirements, which also increases their energy
costs and, in turn, the cost of their services to us. Any significant increase in market prices, transportation costs,
grid fees or taxes (including by reduction of tax benefits) associated with the supply of energy would increase our
operating costs and, thus, may negatively affect our results of operations if we are not able to pass the increased
costs on to our customers. Increases in energy prices may also increase the price at which we are able to access
shipping services. There can be no assurances that any inability or delay in passing on increases in energy costs,
or increases in shipping costs resulting from increases in energy costs, to our customers or any interruption or
shortage of energy supply could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. Although we assume that we will have certain privileges as a critical infrastructure business in most
of the countries in which we have production sites, there can be no assurances that we will not face significant
increased energy costs for, or disruptions in energy supplies to, our sites.

**_Transportation and logistics capacity may not be available to us on satisfactory terms_**

We rely on third-party global supply chain and logistics capacity to transport products from our suppliers, to our
customers and across our business operations. In the past two years, transportation and logistics capacity has been
impacted by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, with increased demand for these services across the
transportation industry. In the case of local warehousing and last mile logistic services, we rely on our own and
on third-party logistics infrastructure and therefore deeply reliant on the smooth functioning of the warehousing
and last mile logistics platforms that we use. While we may be able to deploy resources of our own to replace a
deficiency of last mile logistics service providers, we may not be able to do so in a timely or cost-effective way.
We rely on global supply chain and logistics capacity to operate our business, and supply chain disruptions have
negatively impacted our business as a result of increased cost of accessing chemical transportation and other
logistics services and as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and may continue to negatively impact our
business.

**_Our products may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that delay or prevent their regulatory_**
**_approval or limit their commercial potential._**

Although we disclose all known material side effects of our Generics, Consumer Healthcare products and
Specialty products in leaflets included in each product packaging, undesirable side effects caused by any of our
product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt development, could result in
the denial of regulatory approval of our product, lead to potential product liability claims and could damage our
brand reputation.

Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining the commercial success of our product
candidates, could substantially increase commercialization costs and, in general, could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the
New Notes.

**_Counterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and reputation._**

Our industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and
the presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the Internet. Counterfeit products
are frequently unsafe or ineffective, and can potentially be life threatening. To distributors and patients, counterfeit
products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version. Reports of adverse reactions to counterfeit
drugs or increased levels of counterfeiting could materially affect patient confidence in the authentic product, and
harm the business of companies, including ours, or lead to litigation. In addition, it is possible that adverse events
caused by unsafe counterfeit products could mistakenly be attributed to the authentic product. While we are not
aware of any material cases in the past, if one of our products were to be the subject of counterfeits in the future,
we could incur substantial reputational and financial harm.

-----

**_We commercialize some of our products under license from third-party pharmaceutical companies._**

As of December 31, 2021, we commercialized certain of our products under license from a variety of
pharmaceutical companies. Our license agreements for in-licensed products typically provide that the licensor
shall manufacture such products for an initial term of several years and impose payment and other material
obligations on us. Although we believe that we currently comply with all our material obligations under these
licenses, should we breach any such obligations, our counterparties may be entitled to terminate the licenses. This
may restrict, delay or eliminate our ability to continue commercializing these in licensed products, which could
adversely affect our business.

Our failure to in license new products or compounds for development and distribution, replace existing products
as needed or to retain our currently in licensed products on a commercially reasonable basis, or at all, could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our
obligations under the New Notes.

**_We may be unable to recruit and retain key personnel, including qualified scientific, technical and sales_**
**_employees._**

We are highly dependent on our senior management and key employees, including our scientific, technical and
sales personnel. The loss of any senior manager or key employee may significantly delay or prevent the
achievement of our product development or business objectives. Due to the specialized scientific nature of our
business, we are highly dependent upon our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical
and sales personnel. The loss of the services of, or failure to recruit, key management, scientific, technical or sales
personnel could be materially detrimental to our business and financial condition. We face competition for
scientific and technical personnel from other companies, academic institutions, government entities and other
organizations. Such competition is also enhanced by the reduction of specialized personnel in certain key
functional areas, such as engineers in Germany. In addition, as a result of the intense competition for highly
qualified personnel in our industry and a sharp increase in inflation rates, we have recently experienced and may
continue to experience wage inflation. Accordingly, our efforts to attract, retain and develop personnel may also
result in significant additional expenses, which could adversely affect our profitability and may harm our ability
to recruit and retain highly skilled employees.

The loss of any key personnel or the inability to attract, recruit and retain highly skilled employees required for
our activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
ability to perform our obligations under the New Notes.

**_A breakdown in our information technology systems could result in a significant disruption of our business._**

Our operations, including research, development, manufacturing, accounting, storage and delivery, are highly
dependent on our information technology systems. We make continuous investments to appropriately adapt these
complex and high performing systems to changing business processes. Such systems are vulnerable to a number
of problems, such as software or hardware malfunctions, malicious hacking, physical damage to vital data centers
and computer virus infection. In addition, the information technology system needs regular upgrading to
accommodate expansion of our business and maintain the efficiency of our operations. If we face a breakdown in
our system, we could experience significant business and operational delays across our businesses. In particular,
any breakdown in our information technology systems could result in disruptions in our research, development,
manufacturing, accounting and billing processes. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result
in a loss of or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could
incur liability and the development of our product candidates could be delayed. Any of this could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations
under the New Notes.

**_We handle personal data including, to a minor extent, sensitive patient data in the ordinary course of our_**
**_business, and any failure to maintain the confidentiality of that data could result in legal liability for us and_**
**_reputational harm to our business._**

We process sensitive personal consumer data (including, in certain instances, consumer names, addresses, and to
a minor extent, patient health data) as part of our business, and therefore we must comply with strict data protection
and privacy laws in all the jurisdictions in which we operate. For example, we are subject to extensive European
laws and regulations on privacy, information security and data protection, the main and most relevant of which
relate to the collection, protection and use of personal and business data, including EU Regulation 2016/679 (the

168


-----

“General Data Protection Regulation” or “GDPR”). In particular, we adapted our internal procedures to the
requirements imposed by the GDPR. The costs of complying with the GDPR are increasing, particularly in the
context of ensuring that adequate data protection and data transfer mechanisms are in place. Any failure to comply
with data protection laws such as the GDPR may result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental
investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation. However, given the size of
our operations, data breaches may occur a result of human error or events beyond our control, such as external
hackings, malware infections, malicious user activities, internal security breaches and physical security breaches
due to unauthorized personnel gaining physical access to our premises. We have reported a number of potential
data breaches with the relevant authorities since 2019, which have been closed without any fine or any other
measures (such as audits), being taken by the authority, and currently we do not have any open reports under
investigation.

Moreover, data protection laws and rules impose certain standards of protection and safeguarding on our ability
to collect and use personal information relating to customers and potential customers, and could make us liable in
the event of a loss of control of such data or as a result of unauthorized third-party access. Unauthorized data
disclosure could occur through cybersecurity breaches as a result of human error, external hacking, malware
infection, malicious or accidental user activity, internal security breaches and physical security breaches due to
unauthorized personnel gaining physical access.

We and our customers and suppliers who carry out our outsourcing, have been in the past and could be in the
future subject to breaches of security by hackers. A future breach of our system or that of one of our customers or
outsourcing partners may subject us to material losses or liability, including fines, claims for unauthorized use of
personal and sensitive data or other claims. A misuse of such data or a cybersecurity breach could harm our
reputation, increase our operating expenses in order to correct the breaches or failures, expose us to uninsured
liability, increase our risk of regulatory scrutiny, subject us to lawsuits, result in the imposition of material
penalties and fines under any applicable international laws or regulations, and adversely affect our business and
results of operations.

We have policies and procedures in place to seek to prevent such breaches and carry out detailed root cause
analysis on any breach that does occur in order to ensure that similar occurrences do not arise. However, if a single
material breach or series of less material breaches was to occur, we could face liability under data protection laws,
could lose the goodwill of our clients and could have our reputation damaged, all of which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations
under the New Notes.

**_We are exposed to default or counterparty risks in connection with our operating business or as a result of_**
**_contracting parties’ failure to meet their contractual obligations._**

We are exposed to default and counterparty risks in connection with deliveries of our products and services to
customers or as a result of financing or hedging activities if contracting parties fail to meet their obligations. In
addition, there is the risk that, in a difficult economic and financial environment, national healthcare systems may
delay or fail to make payments to us or our business partners, thus generating or increasing default or counterparty
risks. Furthermore, default and counterparty risks from social health insurance providers (“SHIs”) have increased
due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in Germany, rebate agreements with SHIs require pharmaceutical
companies to ensure uninterrupted delivery capability. In the event that we are unable to complete relevant
deliveries, including for causes that might be related to COVID-19, we would be subject to contractual penalties
and/or compensation claims. Although we could claim that contractual performance has been rendered impossible
by factors outside our control (including, in some circumstances, events attributable to COVID-19 and/or its
ongoing effects) and potentially invoke force majeure clauses, where available, we would need to prove that any
such factors and events fall within the scope of such clauses and that our specific inability to perform deliveries
is directly attributable to the applicable factors and events, any of which may be difficult or impossible to prove,
particularly in light of the complexity of the pharmaceutical industry supply chains. While we strive to maintain
business relations with business partners of good financial standing and adopt suitable measures to safeguard us
against default risk, including guarantees, letters of credit, credit insurance or the transfer of assets, it cannot be
ruled out that these measures may be insufficient. In addition, in certain developing markets, we rely on thirdparty distributors and other agents for the marketing and distribution of products, who may have inadequate
internal compliance resources.

Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and ability
to perform our obligations under the New Notes.

**_The recent development of vaping products means the long-term health effects of vaping product use is not yet_**
**_understood by medical professionals._**

Our Consumer Healthcare portfolio features non-generic pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products,
including vaping products, such as electronic cigarettes and vaporizers, which represented less than 2% of our
Consumer Healthcare sales in the year ended December 31, 2021. These battery-powered products enable users
to inhale nicotine vapor without smoke, tar, ash or carbon monoxide and are marketed as alternatives to traditional
tobacco cigarettes and cigars. Although vaping products do not currently account for a material portion of our
sales, with respect to such products, we are exposed to long-term health related risks. Because vaping products
were recently developed, the medical profession has not had a sufficient period of time in which to study the long
term health effects of vaping product use. As a result, it is unclear how safe vaping products are for their intended
use, or whether they may pose risks different from those posed by traditional cigarettes and cigars. For instance,
some U.S. states have imposed a sales ban on e-cigarettes. If the medical profession were to determine
conclusively that vaping product usage poses long-term health risks, vaping product usage could decline and we
could be exposed to the risk of litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the New Notes.

**_Fluctuations in exchange rates may adversely affect our business and results of operations._**

We market our products in approximately 120 countries, have a direct presence in Europe, the MENA region,
Asia and Australia, and operate 20 manufacturing facilities in 12 countries. Accordingly, a significant portion of
our sales, expenses, assets and liabilities are in currencies other than the euro, our reporting currency, and as such
our results are subject to foreign exchange translation and transaction risks. Our primary foreign exchange rate
risks relate to the U.S. dollar, Russian ruble, British pound sterling and Serbian dinar.

Transactional risk arises when we and our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency other than our and their
respective functional currencies. To the extent that we incur expenses in one currency but generate sales in another,
any change in the values of those currencies could cause our profits to decrease or our products to be less
competitive than those of our competitors. To the extent that cash and receivables that are denominated in
currencies other than the respective functional currency are greater or less than our liabilities denominated in a
different currency, we will be exposed to the risk of fluctuations and movements in the foreign exchange markets.
Where we are unable to match sales and receivables denominated in foreign currencies with expenses and
liabilities denominated in the same currency, our results of operations are affected by currency exchange rate
fluctuations.

Additionally, currency risk arises in connection with the translation of the financial condition and results of
operations of our international subsidiaries with non-euro reporting currencies into our euro reporting currency.
For example, a currency sensitivity analysis (translation risk) on the basis of our foreign currency items as of
December 31, 2021 showed that in the year ended December 31, 2021, an appreciation or devaluation of the
functional currency compared with the Russian ruble by 10%, with otherwise unchanged conditions, would have
led to a change in our EBITDA of approximately €23.6 million. At the same time, an appreciation or devaluation
of the functional currency in relation to the British pound sterling of 10%, with otherwise unchanged conditions
would have led to a change in our EBITDA of approximately €34.2 million. Any of these factors could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our
obligations under the New Notes.

We generally employ different financial derivatives to counter the risks associated with assets, liabilities and
anticipated future cash flows denominated in foreign currency. However, to the extent that such financial
instruments are not sufficient or not effective or due to a default risk of the relevant counterparty, fluctuations of
local currencies could affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations
under the New Notes.

**_We may be exposed to transfer price risks in connection with our operating activities._**

We take advantage of our international network and centralize our strategic functions. In particular, we transfer
and provide goods and services among the companies of the Group by adopting a corporate tax transfer frame
model for the billing of intercompany services. There is a risk that tax authorities in individual countries will
assess the relevant transfer prices differently from our tax transfer pricing model and address retroactive tax claims
against one of our companies. While our tax transfer pricing model has been agreed between the competent
authorities in certain countries, in others such model is still under discussion with the authorities. For example,
transfer pricing agreements are currently under discussion between the German and the Italian tax authorities.

170


-----

There can be no assurance that our transfer prices will be accepted by all the relevant authorities. If they fail to be
accepted, this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and ability to
perform our obligations under the New Notes.

**_We are exposed to interest rate and inflation risks in connection with pension obligations._**

As we are highly dependent on our executives and key employees, we maintain pension plans as an incentive to
retain key employees. We are exposed to the risk of additional payments due to the changing macroeconomic
environment.

Additional payments to the pension obligation plans could have an adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the New Notes.

**_Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets may adversely affect our results of operations._**

Subject to certain conditions, we capitalize development expenses incurred in connection with the approval
process necessary to obtain marketing authorizations for our products and recognize such expenses as intangible
assets. In addition, as a consequence of our acquisition strategy, we regularly recognize significant amounts of
goodwill on our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021, we had intangible assets of €5,469.8 million of which
€575.3 million related to goodwill.

Goodwill is not amortized over its useful life. Instead, an impairment test is performed at least once a year (the
impairment only approach) and additional reviews may be carried out if indications of impairment become
apparent. In the impairment test, the carrying amount of each cash generating unit is compared with its recoverable
amount and, if necessary, an impairment loss is recognized in the income statement. All intangible assets other
than goodwill are initially measured at cost. Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized on a straight
line basis over their useful life. If, on the reporting date, there are indications that these intangible assets are
impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is reevaluated and impairment losses are recognized according to
the difference to the carrying amount. We recognize the difference between the carrying amount and the
recoverable amount as impairment loss in the income statement. If the reasons for recognizing an impairment loss
cease to exist for these assets, corresponding write ups are carried out up to a maximum of the amortized cost.
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized. In the context of annual impairment tests and in
all other cases showing indications of impairment, the recoverable amounts of these assets are compared with
their carrying amounts and, if necessary, an impairment loss is recognized. For this purpose, the fair value of the
asset less costs to sell is determined using the relief from royalty method. We recognized intangible assets with
an indefinite useful life in connection with our acquisition of the STADA Group for the brands STADA and
Hemofarm. If the reasons for recognizing an impairment loss cease to exist, corresponding write ups are carried
out up to a maximum of the acquisition cost. Intangible assets that are not yet available for use are also generally
evaluated in the context of annual impairment tests. Furthermore, in each reporting period, an audit is carried out
to verify whether the reasons for recognizing an indefinite useful life continue to exist.

The amount of impairment losses that we are required to recognize in the future may be significant, particularly
in the event of material acquisitions or products that perform below our expectations. See “—Our business could
_be adversely affected if we incur significant integration costs with respect to any of our bolt on acquisitions, if we_
_fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions or if we are unable to enforce claims relating to a breach of the_
_representations and warranties provided in connection with such acquisitions” and “—Our ability to market our_
_products successfully depends, in part, upon the acceptance of the products not only by end users, but also by_
_independent third parties, including public health insurers, doctors and pharmacists, depending on the_
_jurisdiction in which we operate.”_

The future development of the macroeconomic environment, unsuccessful acquisitions or other factors could lead
to possible significant impairments to be recognized in the future, potentially with a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the New Notes.

**_Our business is subject to liquidity risks._**

Our business is subject to liquidity risks or the risk that we may not have sufficient borrowing facilities and
working capital to fund the existing and future growth of our business. Liquidity risks may result, for example,
from the loss of existing cash items, lack of availability of credit, reduced access to financing or fluctuation in the
operational development of our business. Lack of availability of credit may have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the New Notes.

171


-----

**_Our business is subject to other operating risks, including natural disasters, fire, explosion, sabotage, terrorism_**
**_and other criminal activities which may adversely affect our financial condition._**

Our operations are subject to risks normally incidental to manufacturing operations that may result in work
stoppages and/or damage to property. These risks include unexpected disruptions in infrastructure, strikes,
accidents, natural disasters, fire, explosion, sabotage, criminal activities and terrorism. While we protect ourselves
against such risks to the extent possible and financially reasonable through appropriate insurance policies, it
cannot be excluded that this protection will not be sufficient and that any of these events could have a material
adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and ability to perform our obligations under the
New Notes.

**_We are subject to complex tax laws, and changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely_**
**_affect our results of operations and financial condition._**

Changes in tax laws could adversely affect our tax positions, including our effective tax rate or tax payments. We
often rely on generally available interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. We cannot be certain that
the relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these laws. If our tax positions are
challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require us to pay taxes that we
currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our services to track and collect such taxes, which could
increase our costs of operations and have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, operating results
and cash flows.

**_Pending and future tax audits within our business and changes in fiscal regulations could lead to additional_**
**_tax liabilities._**

Our business activity is assessed for tax purposes based on currently applicable tax legislation taking into account
current case law and administrative interpretations. There may be uncertainties, however, regarding the tax
treatment of specific transactions (including in connection with the Sanofi Acquisition) and we may contest taxes
assessed against us. As a result, there can be no assurance that our current and future position on taxation matters
will be accepted by the relevant tax authorities. Such uncertainties in the applicable tax legislation or case law, as
well as any changes in interpretation by the tax authorities, could have a material adverse effect on our net assets,
financial condition and results of operations.

We are regularly subject to tax audits. While we believe that it has paid all material tax liabilities and filed all
material tax returns as of the date of this Exchange Offer Memorandum, and made provisions that we believe to
be adequate with respect to material tax risks resulting from current or past tax audits, there can be no assurance
that no tax deficiency will be asserted against us or that the taxes assessed by the competent authorities pursuant
to such tax audits will not exceed such provisions. All the tax assessments issued for periods that were not yet
finally audited may be subject to review. Additionally, mergers and restructuring measures as well as the
implementation of fiscal unities (steuerliche Organschaften) may change our overall tax position.

**_We could be adversely affected by changes to the composition of the Eurozone._**

If one or more countries in the Eurozone default on their debt obligations and/or cease using the euro, there may
be significant, extended and generalized dislocation in the financial markets and in the wider European economy,
which may negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The departure of one or
more countries from the Eurozone may lead to the imposition of exchange rate control laws. The departure or risk
of departure from the euro by one or more Eurozone countries could increase our exposure to changes in exchange
rates and have negative effects on our existing relationships with our suppliers or customers, resulting in a negative
impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the possible dissolution of the
euro entirely, or the threat of such dissolution, could lead to increased market volatility, which in turn could have
an adverse effect on our business. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for
holders of euro denominated obligations and for parties subject to other contractual provisions referencing the
euro would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments could adversely affect our
operations.

Market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro and the potential reintroduction of individual currencies
within the Eurozone could also have adverse consequences for us. Financial markets and the supply of credit may
be negatively impacted by, among other factors, fears surrounding the sovereign debts and/or fiscal deficits of
several countries in Europe, the possibility of the further downgrading of or defaults on sovereign debt, concerns

172


-----

about a slowdown in growth in certain economies and uncertainties regarding the overall stability and
sustainability of the euro given the economic and political circumstances in individual member states.

A deterioration in general economic conditions caused by instability in the Eurozone could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We may not be able to realize anticipated operational efficiencies and cost savings._**

In connection with the STADA Acquisition, we identified certain operational efficiency and cost saving measures
that we started to implement in 2017. We have since identified additional measures, as described in footnote (E)
under “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Other Consolidated Financial and Pro Forma
_Data.” We may not be able to realize the anticipated efficiencies and savings targeted by these measures, either_
in the amount or within the time frame that we currently anticipate, and the costs of achieving these measures may
be higher than we expect.

Our estimated efficiency gains and cost savings are forward-looking and therefore subject to a number of
assumptions about the timing, execution and costs associated with realizing the underlying measures. Such
assumptions are inherently uncertain and are subject to significant business, economic and competition risks and
uncertainties. There can be no assurance that such assumptions will turn out to be correct. In addition, the
estimated efficiency gains and cost savings may be offset by deterioration in the markets in which we operate,
increases in other expenses or challenges in the business. As a result, the amount of efficiency gains and savings
that we will actually realize and/or the timing of any such realization may differ significantly (and may be
significantly lower or later) from the ones that we currently estimate, and we may incur significant costs in
reaching estimated gains and savings. Failure to achieve expected efficiency gains and savings could have a
material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

**_We may incur additional indebtedness prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue Date, and_**
**_such indebtedness could increase our leverage and may have terms that are more or less favorable than the_**
**_terms of the New Notes and our other existing indebtedness._**

We or our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt, including in connection with a refinancing of our
existing debt, to fund any future acquisition or for general corporate purposes. In connection with our financial
strategy, we continually evaluate different financing alternatives, and may decide to enter into new credit facilities,
access the debt capital markets, incur other indebtedness or enter into liability management transactions, including
vendor financing transactions by a special purpose entity and any related senior unsecured credit facilities, from
time to time, including prior to, or within a short time period after the Issue Date. Any such offering or incurrence
of debt will be made at our election or the election of our relevant subsidiaries, and if such debt is in the form of
securities, may be offered and sold pursuant to, and on the terms described in, a separate offering memorandum.
The interest rate with respect to any such additional debt will be set at the time of the pricing or incurrence of such
debt and may be less than or greater than the interest rate applicable to the New Notes and our other existing debt,
including, in the case of a refinancing, the debt that is being refinanced, which would have a corresponding effect
on our cash interest expense on a pro forma basis. In addition, the maturity date of any such additional debt will
be set at the time of pricing or incurrence of such debt and may be earlier or later than the maturity date of the
New Notes and our other existing debt. The other terms of such additional debt would be as agreed with the
relevant lenders or holders thereof and could be more or less favorable than the terms of the New Notes or our
other existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we or our subsidiaries will elect to raise any such
additional debt or that any effort to raise such debt will be successful, and there can be no assurance as to the
timing of such offering or incurrence, or the amount or terms of any such additional debt. If we incur new debt in
addition to our current debt, the related risks that we now face, even in a refinancing transaction, as described
above and elsewhere in this Exchange Offer Memorandum could intensify.

**Risks Relating to the New Notes**

**_The Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors will have control over the Senior Secured Notes_**
**_Collateral, and the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the New Notes._**

The Security Documents relating to the Senior Secured Notes allow and will allow the Issuer, the Senior Secured
Notes Guarantors and the other Senior Secured Notes Collateral providers to remain in possession of, retain
exclusive control over, freely operate and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral to the extent that it relates to their assets. So long as no acceleration event has occurred and subject to
certain conditions, the Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors and the other Senior Secured Notes Collateral

173


-----

providers will be able to, among other things, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct
ordinary course activities with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, such as selling, factoring,
abandoning or otherwise disposing of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and making ordinary course cash
payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

**_If the Revolving Credit Facility is designated as a super senior liability in accordance with the terms of the_**
**_Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging_**
**_obligations and future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes_**
**_Indentures and the Intercreditor Agreement ranking pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility are, or will_**
**_be, entitled to be repaid with proceeds from the enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral in priority_**
**_over the New Notes._**

The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions governing the sharing of proceeds from enforcement of the
Senior Secured Notes Collateral. Such enforcement proceeds are required to be turned over to the Security Agent
after certain events, including the acceleration of any of the Senior Secured Notes. The Security Agent is required
to apply turned over amounts and other recoveries by the Security Agent from enforcement actions toward
discharging the super senior obligations (including, among others (following the designation of the Revolving
Credit Facility as a super senior liability in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement), those under
the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and future indebtedness that may be secured on a super
senior basis (the “Super Senior Liabilities”)) in priority to applying any such amounts toward discharging the
Senior Secured Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, you may not
benefit from such recoveries if the then outstanding claims under such Super Senior Liabilities are greater than
the proceeds recovered. Any proceeds remaining from an enforcement sale of Senior Secured Notes Collateral
will, after all obligations under such Super Senior Liabilities have been discharged, be applied _pro rata in_
repayment of the Senior Term Facilities, Senior Secured Notes (if the Revolving Credit Facility has not been
designated as a super senior liability in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement), the Revolving
Credit Facility and any other indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes.

Furthermore, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Senior Secured
Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Senior Secured Notes. As
such, the claims of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such
secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

**_Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Senior Secured Notes_**
**_Collateral._**

The obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees thereof are or will be
secured, as applicable, on a first priority basis with security interests over the Senior Secured Notes Collateral that
also secure our obligations under the Super Senior Liabilities. The Senior Secured Notes Indentures also permit,
or will permit, as applicable, the Senior Secured Notes Collateral to secure additional indebtedness in accordance
with the terms thereof and of the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security
Agent will only enforce the Senior Secured Notes Collateral as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement and
the Senior Secured Notes Indentures regulate, or will regulate, as applicable, the ability of the Trustee, the New
Notes Trustee or the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action.

Prior to the Issuer designating any liabilities as Super Senior Liabilities in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement (the “Designation Date”), the Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action
unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that consists of the holders of the aggregate principal amount of
the then outstanding Senior Secured Notes, the senior lenders, creditors in respect of indebtedness ranking pari
_passu with the senior creditors and creditors in respect of certain non-priority hedging obligations (the “Senior_
_Secured Credit Participations”) which aggregate more than 50% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations_
at that time (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”) (in each case acting through their respective creditor
representatives). If the Majority Senior Secured Creditors do not instruct the Security Agent to enforce, or instruct
the Security Agent to cease enforcing, the transaction security, then creditors holding more than 50% of the total
second lien credit participations (or, in certain cases, creditors holding 50% of the total Topco Creditors
participations) may instruct the Security Agent to enforce.

Following the Designation Date, the Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed
to do so by an instructing group that may consist of either (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or (ii) creditors
holding more than 50% of the total participations in Super Senior Liabilities at that time (the “Majority Super
_Senior Creditors”). The Security Agent is required to act in accordance with instructions received from the_

174


-----

Majority Senior Secured Creditors, however: (i) if and to the extent the obligations under the Super Senior
Liabilities have not been fully discharged in cash within six months of enforcement instructions first being issued
by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors; or (ii) if the Security
Agent has not commenced enforcement action within three months of enforcement instructions first being issued
by either the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors, then the enforcement
instructions provided by the Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail.

Following the transaction security having become enforceable, a creditor representative acting on behalf of the
Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors may at any time provide immediate
enforcement instructions to the Security Agent if the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors determine in good faith that to delay the taking of any enforcement action could reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any transaction security or
the realization of enforcement proceeds. In such circumstances, the Security Agent shall act only with respect to
the relevant asset or debtor that is the subject of such determination, in accordance with the first such notice of
such determination and instructions as to enforcement received by the Security Agent, provided in each case that
they are consistent with certain security enforcement principles.

If at any time an insolvency event has occurred with respect to any debtor (other than an insolvency event which
is the direct result of any action taken by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of the Majority Super Senior
Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors), the Security Agent shall act (i) prior to the Designation Date,
in accordance with the instructions of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (without any requirement to first
consult with any junior creditors) or (ii) after the Designation Date and to the extent the Majority Super Senior
Creditors have provided such instructions, in accordance with the instructions received from the Majority Super
Senior Creditors.

The Security Agent may also refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions that it may in its discretion
require until it has been indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction against any cost, loss or liability which it
may incur in complying with those instructions.

To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes
(such as indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement), the voting interest of holders of
Senior Secured Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we
incur.

The creditors of any Super Senior Liabilities may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of
the Senior Secured Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their
remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells Senior Secured Notes Collateral consisting of the
shares of the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of
such entities securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees may be released. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the New
_Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”_

Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the Senior Secured
Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or to
exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents, except through the Security Agent as
provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the New Notes, you will be deemed to have agreed to these
restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will have limited remedies and
recourse against the Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors in the event of a default. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**_The New Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral that will_**
**_be granted as security for the New Notes and future secured indebtedness may be secured by certain assets that_**
**_do not secure the New Notes._**

The New Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral (which also
secures the Existing Notes and debt under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement). See “Description of
_the New Notes—Security.” Not all of our assets will secure the New Notes and the New Notes Indenture will allow_
the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure any future senior secured indebtedness (as defined in the New
Notes Indenture) permitted to be incurred under the New Notes Indenture (which may be structurally senior to the

175


-----

New Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees) with the property and assets of the Issuer or the restricted
subsidiaries that do not secure the New Notes. The value of such assets and property could be significant. If an
event of default occurs and the obligations under the New Notes are accelerated, the New Notes and the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees thereof will not benefit from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank equally
with the holders of other unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries with respect to any
property or assets excluded from the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the New Notes.

While the New Notes Indenture will create certain obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant
additional security over assets, or a particular class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of
future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, such obligations are subject to the Agreed Security Principles. The
Agreed Security Principles set forth in the New Notes Indenture set out a number of limitations on the rights of
the holders of the New Notes to be granted security or guarantees in certain circumstances. The operation of the
Agreed Security Principles may result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any Senior Secured
Notes Collateral provided being limited or security not being granted over a particular type or class of assets.
Accordingly, the Agreed Security Principles may affect the value of the security or guarantees provided by the
Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors.

**_The value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the New Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our_**
**_obligations under the New Notes and such collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances._**

If we default on the New Notes, holders of the New Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the
assets underlying the security interests granted in favor of holders of the New Notes. In the event of an enforcement
of the security interests in respect of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, the proceeds from the sale of the assets
underlying the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes. No appraisal of the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral has been
made in connection with the Exchange Offers. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on
many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory
restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the
economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers.

The shares and other Senior Secured Notes Collateral that are pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders
of the New Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the New Notes, in part because most of such
collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot
assure you that the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial
delays in the liquidation thereof. Industry regulations in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, such as
Germany and Russia, include restrictions on persons who may hold certain of our licenses, authorizations and
consents that are necessary to operate our business. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business
operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby
decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security Documents, enforcement of the
Senior Secured Notes Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions,
governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents,
approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed,
a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be
significantly decreased. Most of our assets do not secure the New Notes and it is possible that the value of the
Senior Secured Notes Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Senior
Secured Notes Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the New Notes and the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantees thereof, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the
obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining
assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not
recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of this Senior Secured Notes
Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral are not sufficient to repay
all amounts due on the New Notes, the holders of the New Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of
the sale of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured, unsubordinated claim against
the Issuer’s and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors’ remaining assets.

The New Notes Indenture will permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the
New Notes on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or
third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the New Notes Indenture or the
Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Senior Secured
Notes Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the New

176


-----

Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional Senior Secured Notes under the New Notes Indenture, holders of such
Senior Secured Notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the New Notes being offered hereby,
thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral.

**_The granting of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and security interests to secure the New Notes, or the_**
**_incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such security_**
**_interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and security interests to secure the New Notes may create
hardening or voidance periods for such Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and security interests in certain
jurisdictions. The granting of shared security interests to secure future permitted debt may restart or reopen such
hardening or voidance periods in particular, as the New Notes Indenture will permit the release and retaking of
security granted in favor of the New Notes in certain circumstances including in connection with the incurrence
of future debt. The applicable hardening or voidance period for these new security interests can run from the
moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or
recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening or voidance period applicable in such
jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. See “Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes_
_Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

The same rights also apply following the issuance of the New Notes in connection with the accession of further
subsidiaries as additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantors and the granting of security interests over their relevant
assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the New Notes, as applicable.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the New Notes or under the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees thereof or_**
**_the Senior Secured Notes Collateral across multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult._**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of Germany; the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors are organized under the
laws of Germany, England and Wales, The Netherlands, Belgium, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland;
the Senior Secured Notes Collateral includes the shares of certain of our subsidiaries incorporated under the laws
of those jurisdictions, and certain present and future intercompany loan receivables held by the Issuer and certain
of its subsidiaries in respect of debtors in certain of these jurisdictions. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency,
administration or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. The rights of holders
of the New Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral are likely to be
subject to insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will
be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex proceedings. In addition, the multi-jurisdictional nature
of enforcement over the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may limit the realizable value of the Senior Secured
Notes Collateral.

The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdiction of organization of the Issuer and the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantors may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and with the laws of the
United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability
to obtain post-petition interest, the duration of proceeding and preference periods. The application of these laws,
and any conflict between them, could call into question whether, and to what extent, the laws of any particular
jurisdiction should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantees and the Security Documents in these jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

**_The security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral have been, or will be, granted to the Security_**
**_Agent rather than directly to the holders of the New Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the_**
**_Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be restricted by local law._**

The security interests that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the New Notes and the obligations of the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantors under the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees thereof will not be granted directly
to the holders of the New Notes but to the Security Agent, and thus the holders of the New Notes will not have
any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or to exercise any rights
or powers arising under the Security Documents except through the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor
Agreement. By accepting a New Senior Secured Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions.
As a result of these restrictions, holders of the New Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against us in
the event of a default. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

177


-----

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests is subject to mandatory provisions
of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Senior Secured Notes Collateral are taken. For
example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require
a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws
of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the New Notes that are not identified as
registered holders in a security document will be validly secured. In certain jurisdictions, including Germany, due
to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security interests and the
enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of “parallel debt”
obligations in favor of the Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantors owed to holders of the New Notes under or in connection with the New Notes Indenture,
as applicable (“Principal Obligations”). All or part of the pledges and other security interests in such jurisdictions
have been, or will be, granted to the Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and do not, or will
not, directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel
Debt will be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any
payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment
in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security
interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the New Notes do not have direct security interests and
will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security
Agent. Therefore, the holders of the New Notes bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent.
In addition, the Parallel Debt construct has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions and to the
extent that the security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral created under the Parallel Debt construct
are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the New
Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the
_Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

**_Rights in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the New Notes may be adversely affected by the failure_**
**_to perfect security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the New Notes._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected,
and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor of the security, as
applicable. The liens on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the New Notes may not be perfected with
respect to the claims under the New Notes if we fail or are unable to take the actions necessary to perfect any of
these liens. The creation of a valid security interest under a German law governed pledge agreement in relation to
certain assets (such as bank accounts) may be subject to the delivery of a notice of pledge by the security agent or
the security provider to a third-party (for example, the notice of pledge to the account bank in case of a pledge
over bank accounts). Any failure to perfect any security interest in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing
the New Notes may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest or adversely affect the priority of such
security interest in favor of the New Notes against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other
creditors who claim a security interest in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the New Notes. The New
Notes Trustee and the Security Agent will not be under any obligation or responsibility to take any steps or action
to perfect, or ensure the perfection of, any such liens.

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the New Notes under which the Senior_**
**_Secured Notes Collateral securing the New Notes will be released automatically without your consent or the_**
**_New Notes Trustee or the Security Agent obtaining your further consent._**

Under a variety of circumstances, the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the New Notes will be released
automatically, including a sale, transfer or other disposal of such Senior Secured Notes Collateral in a transaction
that does not violate the asset sale covenant of the New Notes Indenture, and in connection with an enforcement
sale permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement. The New Notes Indenture also will permit us to designate one
or more restricted subsidiaries that are Senior Secured Notes Guarantors as unrestricted subsidiaries. If we
designate a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the New Notes Indenture,
all of the liens on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral owned by such subsidiary and any guarantees of the New
Notes by such subsidiary will be released under the New Notes Indenture, subject to certain conditions.
Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as such will reduce the aggregate value of the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral securing the New Notes to the extent of liens securing the shares of such unrestricted subsidiary or of
its subsidiaries.

178


-----

Furthermore, under German law a secured party is, upon request by the relevant security grantor, obligated to
release security if the realizable value of the security is significantly higher than the value of the obligations
secured by such security.

Finally, if the secured obligations are exchanged, novated or terminated, a pledge or other accessory security
interest created pursuant to a security document governed by German law might be released as a matter of German
law.

**_The insolvency laws of Germany and other applicable jurisdictions may not be as favorable to you as the_**
**_insolvency laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other_**
**_limitations on the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests, including fraudulent_**
**_conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

Our obligations under the New Notes will be guaranteed by the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantors and
secured by security interests over the Senior Secured Notes Collateral (the “Security Interests”). The Issuer is
organized under the laws of Germany and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors are organized under the laws of
Germany, England and Wales, The Netherlands, Belgium, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. There is
a rebuttable presumption that the “centre of main interest” as defined in the Council of the European Union
Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings is the jurisdiction where the registered office is situated. In
addition, the Senior Secured Notes Collateral includes a pledge over the shares in certain of our subsidiaries
incorporated under the laws of Germany, England and Wales, The Netherlands, Belgium, the Republic of Ireland
and Northern Ireland and pledges of certain present and future intercompany loan receivables held by the Issuer
and certain of their subsidiaries incorporated under the laws of Germany, England and Wales, The Netherlands,
the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.

The insolvency laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United
States or other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantors or any other of the Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not
possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would
be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

Although laws differ among the jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and
equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such
jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the New Notes against the Issuer, the enforceability of a Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee against a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor and the enforceability of the Security
Interests. In certain circumstances the court may also void the Security Interest or the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantee if the company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer,
conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which
are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes.

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors or the appointed
insolvency administrator may challenge the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests, and
intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent
transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to:

 - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s obligations under its Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee or the Security Interests provided by such security provider;

 - direct that the Issuer and the holders of the New Notes return any amounts paid under a Senior Secured
Notes Guarantee or any Security Interest to the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security
provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s or security provider’s
creditors; and

 - take other action that is detrimental to you.

If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the New Notes and any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Security
Interest is found to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise
set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the New Notes. In
addition, the liability of each Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider under its Senior Secured Notes
Guarantee or the Security Interests is limited to the amount that will result in such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee
or Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise

179


-----

being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors and security providers under
the Security Documents is also limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would
apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire
Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Security Interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be
extinguished.

See also “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Senior
_Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may adversely affect the validity and_
_enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral.”_

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for
example, need to find that, at the time the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests
created, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider:

 - issued such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering,
delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others or
created such security after its insolvency;

 - issued such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent
business person as a shareholder of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider would have
contributed equity to such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider or where the relevant
beneficiary of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or security interest knew or should have known that the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been
made; or

 - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Senior Secured
Notes Guarantee or security interest on the basis that the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or security
interest was incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s or security
provider’s benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the
issuance of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or the creation of the Security Interest, or subsequently
became insolvent for other reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for
which the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were unreasonably small; or (iii)
intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and
when they would become due.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security
provider generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Senior Secured
Notes Guarantee or created any Security Interest if:

 - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

 - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or

 - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and
liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute.

Although we believe that both the Issuer and the Group are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the
Exchange Offers, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a
Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider was “insolvent” as of the date on which the Senior Secured
Notes Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation,
a court would not determine that a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that
date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or
security provider was insolvent on the date its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee was issued or the Security Interests
were created, that payments to holders of the Senior Secured Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other
grounds.

Guarantees and Security Interests, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity

**_Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability_**
**_of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral._**

Certain of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, England and Wales,
The Netherlands, Belgium, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Enforcement of the obligations under a
Senior Secured Notes Guarantee against, and/or any Senior Secured Notes Collateral provided by, as applicable,
any such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to the Issuer or the relevant
Senior Secured Notes Guarantor, as the case may be. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to
fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or
similar laws as well as regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally, particularly by limiting
the amounts recoverable under the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and Senior Secured Notes Collateral, as
applicable, and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed
or secured by a particular Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider under the applicable laws of each
jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes
Collateral is not in the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate interests, or the
burden of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral exceeds the benefit to the
relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider, or such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior
Secured Notes Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization
rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor
or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability.

In relation to public limited liability companies (Aktiengesellschaften, “AG”), strict German capital maintenance
rules as set out in the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, “AktG”) apply. Senior Secured Notes
Guarantees and/or security interests provided by an AG and/or its direct or indirect subsidiaries in order to
guarantee or secure liabilities of any direct or indirect parent or affiliate company (such as the Issuer) will be,
unless a specific exception applies, considered disbursements violating German capital maintenance law.
Furthermore, the granting of guarantees and/or security interests by an AG or its direct or indirect subsidiaries
which serve the purpose of supporting the financing of the acquisition of shares in such AG (financial assistance)
is prohibited and, therefore, invalid. Investors should note that STADA is incorporated in Germany in the form of
an AG.

According to the wording of the law, both the prohibition of financial assistance as well as the capital maintenance
requirements described above are not applicable while a domination and/or profit and loss transfer agreement
(Beherrschungs- und/oder Gewinnabführungsvertrag) exists between the AG and the shareholder on whose
instructions the relevant guarantee and/or security interest is granted. However, neither the Senior Secured Notes
Indentures nor the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement contain, nor will contain, as applicable, any
covenant requiring the Issuer or any of its respective subsidiaries to take any efforts to implement or maintain a
domination and/or profit and loss transfer agreement. Furthermore, even in the case where a domination and/or
profit and loss transfer agreement is in place and provided that certain other requirements are met, the granting of
guarantees and/or security interests by an AG and/or its direct or indirect subsidiaries (whether or not to support
the acquisition of such AG) may be considered to be in violation of the capital maintenance rules and financial
assistance restrictions, in which case such guarantees and security interests can be void, unenforceable, restricted
and/or subject to a redemption claim against the beneficiary. In particular, under the prevailing view in German
literature, the domination and/or profit and loss transfer agreement exemption only applies if payments under the
guarantee or enforcement of the security interests, as applicable, do not cause the dominated entity (i.e., the AG)
to incur a balance sheet loss for which it cannot reasonably expect to be compensated for by the dominating entity
due to the financial condition of the dominating entity. Therefore, any Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and/or
Senior Secured Notes Collateral provided by an AG, including STADA and any of its direct and indirect
subsidiaries, will be subject to certain contractual limitations (“Limitation Language”) contained in the Senior
Secured Notes Indentures (or any other document governing the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees) and that are
or will be contained in the Security Documents, respectively, designed to ensure compliance with applicable
capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or any other general statutory laws. With respect to the domination
and/or profit and loss transfer agreement exemption, such contractual enforcement limitations will apply
notwithstanding the existence of a domination and/or profit and loss transfer agreement if and to the extent the
enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee and/or Senior Secured Notes Collateral, as applicable,
provided by an AG, including STADA and/or any of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, will or is expected to,
result in an annual loss to the respective AG and such annual loss would not be, or cannot be expected to be,
compensated for by a compensation claim under the domination and/or profit and loss transfer agreement that can
be accounted for in the balance sheet of STADA at full (vollwertig).

-----

Furthermore, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and/or security interests granted by a GmbH or a partnership
with a GmbH as liable partner (i.e., a GmbH & Co. KG) for the purpose of guaranteeing or securing liabilities of
its direct or indirect shareholders or a subsidiary of such shareholders (excluding direct or indirect subsidiaries of
the relevant GmbH, GmbH & Co. KG) are considered to constitute a benefit for such shareholder and therefore
are subject to certain capital maintenance and liquidity maintenance rules. Therefore, any Senior Secured Notes
Guarantees and/or Senior Secured Notes Collateral provided by a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG, including by the
Issuer, are subject to Limitation Language contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indentures (or any other
document under which any Guarantee is granted) and that are or will be contained in the Security Documents,
respectively, designed to ensure compliance with applicable capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or any
other general statutory laws. The pledge over STADA shares is granted by German Holdco and is subject to
Limitation Language.

Any guarantee and/or security interest granted by a GmbH, GmbH & Co. KG or AG may be held invalid pursuant
to Section 138 of the German Civil Code and would therefore not be enforceable if, at the time of the creation or
enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security interest, amongst others, the third-party creditor and the
affiliate have acted in fraudulent conveyance (kollusives Zusammenwirken) to the detriment of the GmbH, GmbH
& Co. KG or AG or other third-party creditors of such entity.

As a result, any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s or security provider’s liability under its Senior Secured Notes
Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending upon the law
and contractual enforcement restrictions applicable to it. This could lead to a situation in which such Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral cannot be enforced at all. It is possible that a Senior
Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider, or any of their creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other
insolvency office holder in the case of a bankruptcy/insolvency of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security
provider, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s Guarantee or the
security provider’s Senior Secured Notes Collateral on any of the above grounds and that the applicable court may
determine that the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Senior Secured Notes Collateral should be limited or
voided. To the extent that any limitations on the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantees or Senior Secured
Notes Collateral apply, the Senior Secured Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities
of the applicable Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider, including trade payables of such Senior
Secured Notes Guarantor or security provider. Future Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and Senior Secured Notes
Collateral may be subject to similar limitations.

See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Senior
_Secured Notes Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

**_Transfer of the New Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the New Notes._**

Because the New Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees have not been, and will not be, and are not
required to be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may
not be offered or sold in the United States except to Qualified Institutional Buyers in accordance with Rule 144A,
to non U.S. persons in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to another exemption
from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and all other
applicable laws. These restrictions may limit the ability of investors to resell the New Notes. It is the obligation
of investors in the New Notes to ensure that all offers and sales of the New Notes in the United States and other
countries comply with applicable securities laws. See “Issue and Resale Restrictions.”

**_The New Notes will initially be held in book entry form and therefore investors must rely on the procedures of_**
**_the relevant Clearing Systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The New Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Interests in the global notes representing the New Notes will trade in book entry form only, and New Notes in
definitive registered form, or Definitive Registered Notes (as defined below), will be issued in exchange for book
entry interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of book entry interests will not be considered owners
or holders of New Notes. The common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole
registered holder of the global notes representing the New Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other
amounts owing on or in respect of the global notes representing the New Notes will be made to the Paying Agent,
which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to
participants’ accounts that hold book entry interests in the global notes representing the New Notes and credited

182


-----

by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to Euroclear and Clearstream, the Issuer, the New
Notes Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will have no responsibility or liability for
the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book entry interests. Accordingly, if investors
own a book entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and if investors are not
participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they
own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the New Notes under the New Notes
Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the New Notes themselves, owners of book entry interests will not have the direct right to
act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the New
Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent it has received
appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures implemented for the granting of
such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the New Notes Indenture, unless and until Definitive
Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book entry interests, if investors own book entry interests, they will
be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures to be implemented through Euroclear
and Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the New Notes.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the New Notes, in which case your ability to sell the New Notes_**
**_will be limited._**

The New Notes will not be fungible with the Existing Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We cannot
assure you that an active trading market will develop for the New Notes.

Furthermore, we cannot assure you as to:

- the liquidity of any market in the New Notes;

- your ability to sell your New Notes; or

- the prices at which you would be able to sell your New Notes.

Future trading prices of the New Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing
interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity of a trading market for the
New Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities. Historically, the
market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility
in the prices of securities similar to the New Notes. See “Risks Related to our Business and Industry — Political
_instability and military action involving Ukraine, Belarus and Russia may affect our business and results of_
_operations,” “—We are exposed to changes in demand for our products due to economic, political and regulatory_
_factors that are beyond our control.”_

Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of New Notes, regardless of our prospects and
financial performance. There is no assurance that an active trading market will develop for the New Notes. If no
active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your New Notes at a fair value, if at all.

**_The New Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the claims of_**
**_creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any), of our non-Senior Secured_**
**_Notes Guarantor subsidiaries._**

Generally, claims of creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any) of nonSenior Secured Notes Guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer, are entitled to payment of their claims from the assets
of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to their respective parent entity or the
creditors of the Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors. Accordingly, in the event that any non-Senior
Secured Notes Guarantor subsidiary of the Issuer becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is
otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

- the creditors of the Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors (including the holders of the New
Notes) will have no right to proceed against the assets of such non Senior Secured Notes Guarantor
subsidiary; and

183


-----

- creditors of such non Senior Secured Notes Guarantor subsidiary, including depositors, trade creditors and
preferred stockholders (if any) will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal
of the assets of such subsidiary before the Issuer or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor, as a direct or
indirect shareholder (as applicable), will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.

As such, the New Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the creditors,
including depositors, trade creditors and any preferred stockholders (if any) of the non-Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Indentures, subject to certain
limitations, permit and will permit, as applicable, these non-Senior Secured Notes Guarantor subsidiaries to incur
substantial additional indebtedness without such incurrence constituting a default under the New Notes Indenture
and such indebtedness may also be secured. The New Notes Indenture will not contain any limitation on the
amount of other liabilities, such as deposits and trade payables, that may be incurred by these subsidiaries.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors are organized or incorporated outside the United States and
their business is substantially conducted outside the United States. The directors and executive officers of the
Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors are nonresidents of, and substantially all of their assets are located
outside of, the United States. Although the Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors have or will submit to
the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be
unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors and executive officers of the Issuer
and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors. In addition, as substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantors and their subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located
outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them judgments obtained in U.S. courts.
Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuer and the Senior Secured
Notes Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United
States.

Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of foreign jurisdictions would enforce (i) judgments of
United States courts obtained against the Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors and the directors and
executive officers who are not residents of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the
United States federal and state securities laws or (ii) in original actions brought in such foreign jurisdictions against
us or such persons predicated upon the United States federal and state securities laws.

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters, with Germany and The
Netherlands. For further information see “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

**_The Issuer may be unable to repurchase the New Notes upon a change of control. In addition, under certain_**
**_circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding New Notes in connection with a tender_**
**_offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the tender._**

If a change of control (as defined in the New Notes Indenture) occurs, the Issuer will be required to make an offer
to purchase all the outstanding New Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus any
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase. In such a
situation, the Issuer may not have enough funds to pay for all of the New Notes that are tendered under any such
offer. If a significant principal amount of New Notes is tendered, the Issuer will likely have to obtain financing to
pay for the tendered New Notes. However, the Issuer may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable
terms, if at all. A change of control may also result in an obligation for the Issuer to make similar “change of
control” offer to the holders of the Existing Notes as well as a mandatory prepayment under the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities Agreement and agreements governing any future indebtedness and may result in the acceleration
of such indebtedness. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the New Notes upon a change of control would
constitute a default under the New Notes Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the Existing Notes Indenture.

The change of control provision contained in the New Notes Indenture will not necessarily afford you protection
in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers,
recapitalizations or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate
events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a
change of control as defined in the New Notes Indenture.

184


-----

In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the New Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding New Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such New Notes in such tender
offer and the Issuer, or any third-party making such a tender offer in lieu of such Issuer, purchases all of the New
Notes validly offered for exchange and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have
the right to redeem the New Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a
price equal to the price offered to each other holder of New Notes. See “Description of the New Notes—Optional
_Redemption.”_

**_The term “all or substantially all” in the context of a change of control has no clearly established meaning_**
**_under relevant law and is subject to judicial interpretation such that it may not be certain that a change of_**
**_control has occurred or will occur._**

Upon the occurrence of a transaction that constitutes a change of control under the New Notes Indenture, the
Issuer will be required to make an offer to repurchase all outstanding New Notes. The definition of “change of
control” in the New Notes Indenture will include (with certain exceptions), a disposition of all or substantially all
of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to any person. Although there is a
limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”, it has no clearly established meaning
under relevant law, varies according to the facts and circumstances of the subject transaction and is subject to
judicial interpretation. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining
whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of a person
and therefore it may be unclear whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to
make an offer to repurchase the New Notes.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the New Notes. The credit ratings
address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the New Notes and credit risks in determining
the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the New Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential
impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that
may affect the value of the New Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and
may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurances can be given
that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or
withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A
suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the New Notes by one or more of
the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could
adversely affect the value and trading of the New Notes.

**_Certain covenants and events of default will be suspended if we receive investment grade ratings._**

The New Notes Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the respective dates of the New Notes
Indenture, the New Notes issued under the New Notes Indenture receive an investment grade rating of Baa3 or
better by Moody’s and BBB− or better by S&P, and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing,
then beginning that day and continuing until such time as such New Notes are no longer rated investment grade
by either ratings agency, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to such New Notes. See “Description of the
_New Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.” At any_
time when these covenants are suspended, we will be able to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness,
pay cash dividends and redeem subordinated indebtedness without restriction, each of which may conflict with
the interests of holders of the New Notes. There can be no assurance that the New Notes will ever achieve an
investment grade rating or that any such rating, if achieved, will be maintained.

**_The New Notes may not become listed on the Exchange and, if listed, the New Notes may not remain listed on_**
**_the Exchange._**

Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the New Notes on the Official
List of the Exchange. However, there can be no assurance that the New Notes will become listed. If the Issuer
cannot maintain the listing on the Exchange and the admission to dealing on the Official List thereof, or if it
becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain such
listing on the Official List of the Exchange. Listing of any of the New Notes on the Exchange does not imply that
a public offering of any of the New Notes in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man has been authorized. Although
no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the New Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of the Exchange

185


-----

or another recognized listing exchange, failure to be approved for listing of the New Notes on the Official List of
the Exchange or another recognized listing exchange or the delisting of the New Notes from the Official List of
the Exchange or another listing exchange may have an adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell New Notes in
the secondary market.

**_Transfers of the New Notes will be subject to certain restrictions._**

We have not registered any of the New Notes under the U.S. Securities Act or any other securities laws. Therefore,
you may not offer or sell the New Notes in the United States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and in compliance with all other
securities laws. You should read the discussion under the headings “Issue and Resale Restrictions” for further
information about the transfer restrictions that apply to the New Notes. It is your obligation to ensure that your
offers and sales of the New Notes, as applicable, within the United States and other countries comply with all
applicable securities laws.

**Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could materially adversely affect our business, financial_**
**_position and results of operations and preclude us from satisfying our obligations under the New Notes and_**
**_the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees._**

As of the date of this Exchange Offer Memorandum, we are highly leveraged and have significant debt service
obligations. As of June 30, 2022, after giving _pro forma effect to the Exchange Offers as described under_
“Capitalization,” we would have had total financial indebtedness in the amount of €5,916.3 million, consisting of
the Senior Term Facilities, the Existing Notes, the New Notes, the STADA Existing Debt, the Senior Notes and
certain local facilities. We anticipate that our high leverage will continue to exist for the foreseeable future. See
“Capitalization,” “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the New Notes.”

The degree to which we are leveraged as of the date of this Exchange Offer Memorandum, and following
completion of the Exchange Offers, could have important consequences to holders of the New Notes, including,
but not limited to:

- making it more difficult for the Issuer and its subsidiaries to satisfy their respective obligations with respect
to the New Notes, the Existing Notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and other debt and liabilities we
may incur;

- increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and
industry conditions;

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of
principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund
working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and development or
other general corporate purposes;

- restricting us from pursuing acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive environment
and the industry in which we operate;

- negatively impacting credit terms with our suppliers and other creditors;

- increasing our exposure to interest rate increases because some of our indebtedness bears a floating rate of
interest;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged; and

- limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, capital expenditures, business
opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and increasing the cost of any future
borrowings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our
obligations, including under the New Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

186

**_The Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue generating operations of its own and will depend on cash_**
**_from the operating companies of the STADA Group to be able to make payments on the New Notes and the_**
**_Senior Secured Notes Guarantees._**

The Issuer is a holding company with no business operations other than management of the equity interests it
holds in its subsidiaries. The Issuer is dependent upon the cash flow from its operating subsidiaries in the form of
dividends or other distributions or payments to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the New Notes
and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees thereof. Given the STADA Group’s international operations, it has a
large number of operating subsidiaries and business participations, which individually contribute to our Group’s
results. The amounts of dividends and distributions available to the Issuer will depend on the profitability and
cash flows of its subsidiaries (including the STADA Group) and the ability of each of those subsidiaries to declare
dividends under applicable law or transfer profits under profit and loss transfer agreements, if applicable. The
Issuer’s subsidiaries, however, may not be able to, or may not be permitted under applicable law and/or profit and
loss transfer agreements, if applicable, to, make distributions or advance upstream loans to the Issuer to make
payments in respect of their indebtedness, including the New Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees.

Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may actually prohibit, the ability of these
subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted groups. In particular, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the
Senior Secured Notes Indentures limit, or will limit, as applicable, the ability to upstream cash to the Issuer subject
to certain exceptions. Applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to further taxation. Applicable law as
well as profit and loss transfer agreements between several entities of the Group may also limit the amounts that
some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or transfer
as profits under a profit and loss transfer agreement, if applicable, or even prevent such payments. In particular,
the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Issuer will generally be limited to the amount of
distributable reserves available to each of them and their ability to pay their debts when due. The ability of the
Issuer’s subsidiaries which are party to a profit and loss transfer agreement to transfer profit to the Issuer will
generally be limited to the annual net profit as determined by law and the respective receiving party is obliged to
balance the annual net loss, if any, of the transferring party. STADA is organized under German law which
provides that dividends may only be distributed out of current profits and distributable reserves, and, generally,
interim dividend distributions are not allowed under German law. Under the DPLTA STADA has undertaken to
transfer its entire annual profit (Gewinnabführung) to German Holdco, and German Holdco is obliged to balance
any annual net loss of STADA. The subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the New Notes have no direct
obligation to make payments with respect to the New Notes or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees.

While the New Notes Indenture will limit the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions
on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments, these limitations are subject to significant
qualifications and exceptions, including exceptions for restrictions imposed by applicable law.

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt,_**
**_including the New Notes, and impair our ability to operate our businesses._**

Despite our substantial leverage, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future, including in connection
with acquisitions. The Senior Secured Notes Indentures and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement
permit, or will permit, as applicable, us to incur a substantial amount of indebtedness at subsidiaries that do not
guarantee the New Notes and to incur indebtedness that shares in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral or that
benefits from security interests over assets that do not secure the New Notes. Any debt that our subsidiaries incur
could be structurally or effectively senior to the New Notes to the extent that such subsidiaries do not guarantee
the New Notes or secure the New Notes, and other debt could be secured or could mature prior to the New Notes.
Although the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the Indentures contain, or will contain, as applicable,
restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant
qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred
in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to the Issuer’s and its subsidiaries’
existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. In addition, the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement and the Indentures do not, or will not, as applicable, prevent us from incurring obligations
that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. Our inability to service our debt could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and our ability to fulfil our obligations
under the Senior Secured Notes and the New Notes Guarantees.

**_Due to restrictions on the deductibility of interest expenses or forfeiture of interest carry forwards under_**
**_applicable law, we may be unable to fully deduct interest expenses on our financial liabilities._**

A certain amount of our annual financing expenses (primarily including interest payments) is not deductible under
existing interest limitation rules, especially the German interest barrier rules (Zinsschranke) as further described
below. Subject to certain requirements, the German interest barrier rules impose restrictions on the deductibility
of interest expense for German tax purposes. The German interest barrier rules generally provide for a limitation
on the deduction of net interest expenses in excess of 30% of tax adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of the interest
barrier rules, all entities that are part of the same fiscal unity (Organschaft) for corporate income and trade tax
purposes are treated as one single business. Any nondeductible amount exceeding the threshold of 30% is carried
forward and may be, again subject to the interest barrier rules, deductible in future financial years. Any interest
carry forward may be forfeited in part or in full in connection with certain measures, such as a change of the
ownership structure. Furthermore, on June 20, 2016, the European Council adopted the Directive (EU) 2016/1164
laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market. The
Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive I (ATAD I) contains five legally binding anti abuse measures, which all member
states are generally required to apply against common forms of aggressive tax planning since January 1, 2019.
Part of the package of measures has been the implementation of an interest limitation in line with German rules.
The restriction of the deductibility of interest expenses for tax purposes may have adverse consequences for our
financial position and results of operations. The European Council has also adopted Directive (EU) 2017/952
(ATAD II) targeting mismatches. At the end of June 2021, the German legislator passed the ATAD
Implementation Act (Gesetz zur Umsetzung der Anti-Steuervermeidungsrichtline) in order to implement the
respective changes into German tax law. Amongst others, this act has introduced provisions to counter tax
shortfalls due to mismatches from the use of hybrid financial instruments or hybrid entities or due to dual tax
residency and has amended the CFC rules. These new rules may result in higher taxable income and a higher tax
burden for corporate income tax and trade tax purposes in the current and future tax periods. Further measures
may follow as part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit
Shifting Project.

In addition, certain of our German subsidiaries have considerable tax loss carry forwards which have partially
been capitalized as deferred tax assets in our Financial Statements. The use of such existing tax loss carry forwards
and ongoing losses for German corporate income and trade tax purposes may be forfeited in case of a direct or
indirect transfer of shares, subject to certain limited exceptions. Such restriction, applying to both corporate
income and trade tax, depends on the percentage of share capital or voting rights transferred within a five year
period to one acquirer or person(s) closely related to the acquirer or a group of acquirers with a common interest.
Under current rules, if more than 50% of the share capital or voting rights are transferred to such an acquirer, tax
loss carry forwards and current losses will be forfeited to the extent no exception from the general forfeiture rules
can be applied, such as the built in gains exemption pursuant to which tax loss carry forwards survive to the extent
taxable built in gains are available at the level of the loss carrying entity. Currently, a proceeding is pending at the
German Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) whether forfeiture upon ownership changes of
more than 50% are constitutional. To the extent that the utilization of tax losses is restricted, they cannot be set
off against future tax profits which would result in higher future tax burdens compared to the situation in which
tax loss carry forwards can be used to lower the actual tax burden on profits. Such restriction may require a write
down of the deferred tax assets in our consolidated financial statements and would negatively affect our financial
position and results of operations.

Furthermore, upon the creation of a fiscal unity for German corporate and trade tax purposes, any tax loss carry
forwards and interest carry forwards for German corporate income and trade tax purposes of a subsidiary, which
have been incurred before the creation of the fiscal unity, will be excluded from use for the duration of the fiscal
unity.

**_We are subject to restrictive covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility._**

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and the Indentures contain, or will contain, as applicable,
covenants which impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These agreements limit our ability
to, among other things:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;

- make certain restricted payments and investments;

- transfer or sell assets;

188


-----

- enter into transactions with affiliates;

- create or incur certain liens;

- make certain loans, investments or acquisitions;

- issue or sell share capital of certain of our subsidiaries;

- create or incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to
us;

- take certain actions that would impair the security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral granted
for the benefit of the holders of the New Notes;

- merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and

- pay or redeem subordinated debt or equity.

All of these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the New
_Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future_
operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our
interest.

In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement requires us to comply with certain affirmative
covenants while amounts under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities remain outstanding. Furthermore, under
certain circumstances, the Revolving Credit Facility under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement
requires us to comply with a financial ratio while amounts exceeding a certain threshold remain outstanding under
the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Secured Credit
_Facilities Agreement.” Our ability to meet the financial ratio under the Revolving Credit Facility may be affected_
by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will meet such financial ratio. A breach of any of
the covenants or restrictions under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, including our failure to comply
with the financial ratio under the Revolving Credit Facility, could result in an event of default under the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a payment event of default that is continuing under
the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, subject to the applicable cure period, and upon the acceleration
of indebtedness with respect to any other event of default by the creditors under our Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement, the relevant creditors could cancel the availability of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, together with accrued
interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including
our failure to comply with the financial ratio under the Revolving Credit Facility, could lead to an event of default
and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain, or will contain, as applicable, cross default or cross
acceleration provisions, including the Senior Secured Notes Indentures. If our creditors, including the creditors
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that
our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other
liabilities of our subsidiaries that would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the New
Notes. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any collateral
granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations, which we may not_**
**_be able to generate or raise._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the New Notes, and
to fund our ongoing operations or expansion plans, will depend on our future performance and ability to generate
cash, which, to a certain extent, is subject to the success of our business strategy as well as general economic,
financial, competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory and other factors, as well as other factors discussed in these
“Risk Factors,” many of which are beyond our control.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently
anticipated growth, cost savings or efficiencies will be realized or that future debt financing will be available to
us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the New Notes, or to fund our other
liquidity needs including the repayment at maturity of the then outstanding amount under the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities. At the maturity of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (including the Revolving Credit Facility,

189


-----

which matures one year before the Senior Secured Notes and two years before the Senior Notes), the New Notes
or any other debt that have incurred or may incur in the future, if we do not have sufficient cash flows from
operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be
required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they
mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the New Notes, on or before maturity.

The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital raising transactions
will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot assure you that
we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In
such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay any portion or all of our debt.

Any failure to make payments on the New Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit
rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt,
including the Existing Notes, the Indentures and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, limit, or will limit, as
applicable, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our
debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could
further restrict our business, financial position and results of operations. There can be no assurances that any assets
that we could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of
proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable. If we are unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not
have sufficient cash to meet our obligations.

**_Existing and future drawings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and any future variable interest rate_**
**_debt we incur, bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, thereby increasing our costs and_**
**_reducing our cash flow._**

A portion of our debt bears interest at a variable rate and we are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest
rates, primarily under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which are based on (x) for loans denominated in euros,
the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) (subject to a zero floor if less than zero), (y) for loans denominated
in sterling, the Sterling Over Night Index Average (“SONIA”) plus a variable credit adjustment spread (subject to
a zero floor if the aggregate of SONIA and the applicable credit adjustment spread is less than zero) or (z) for
loans denominated in U.S. dollars or any other currency, the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) (subject
to a zero floor if less than zero), plus, in each case, an applicable margin (based on a margin ratchet). These interest
rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations,
reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the New
Notes. Neither our Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement nor the Indentures contain, or will contain, as
applicable, a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt.

Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates,
there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging
itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate
any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense would
correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow.

Various rates or indices which are deemed to be “reference rates,” including LIBOR, EURIBOR, SONIA and the
Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), have been and are the subject of recent national and international
regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Proposed reforms by regulators include changes to the manner in
which certain reference rates are determined, their discontinuance, or the establishment of alternative reference
rates. Some reforms are already effective, including the EU Benchmark Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011)
and the cessation of the publication of the sterling LIBOR benchmark and certain tenors of the U.S. dollar LIBOR
benchmark after December 31, 2021, while others are still to be implemented. In particular, on March 5, 2021,
the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates
for the calculation of the U.S. dollar LIBOR benchmark after June 30, 2023. These reforms and other pressures
may cause LIBOR, EURIBOR, SONIA, SOFR or other such benchmarks to disappear entirely or to perform

190


-----

differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), and may create disincentives for
market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks, require amendments to debt
documents, result in rates being determined for a period by applicable fallback provisions which may not operate
as intended, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Based on the foregoing, any of these reforms
or pressures or any other changes to a relevant interest rate benchmark, as well as manipulative practices or the
cessation thereof, could affect the level of the published rate, including by causing a sudden or prolonged increase
and/or making it more volatile than it would otherwise be, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to
service debt that bears interest at floating rates calculated by reference to interest rate benchmarks (including, if
applicable, any U.S. dollar denominated loans under the Revolving Credit Facility).

**_The interests of the Sponsors may conflict with your interests as a holder of the New Notes._**

Bain Capital and Cinven Funds indirectly own the majority of the shares of the Issuer. As a result, our shareholders
have and will continue to have, directly or indirectly, the power to affect our legal and capital structure as well as
the ability to elect and change our management and to approve other changes to our operations and to influence
the outcome of matters requiring action by our shareholders. Our shareholders’ interests in certain circumstances
may conflict with your interests as noteholders, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to
pay our debts when due. For example, the shareholders could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness.
Our shareholders are in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in
businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Our shareholders may also pursue acquisition opportunities
that are complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to
us. In addition, our shareholders have held, hold or may hold interests in suppliers or customers of the STADA
Group. Our shareholders and their affiliates could also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures
(including one or more divestitures of all or part of our business or sales of our shares which would result in
changes to our shareholding structure), financings, dividend distributions or other transactions that, in their
judgment, could enhance their equity investments, although such transactions might involve risks to you as a
holder of New Notes.

**Risks relating to the Exchange Offers**

**_The Exchange Offers may be cancelled, delayed or amended._**

We are not obligated to complete the Exchange Offers under certain circumstances and unless and until certain
conditions are satisfied, as described more fully below in “The Exchange Offers—Settlement Conditions.” We
may terminate or withdraw the Exchange Offers if any of the applicable conditions precedent are not satisfied or
waived by the relevant dates.

In addition, subject to certain limitations, we have the right to amend the terms of the Exchange Offers prior to
the Expiration Time. We may choose to terminate or amend certain parts of the Exchange Offers, but retain other
aspects unchanged. Depending on the materiality of the change, we may not be required to extend withdrawal or
revocation rights following the announcement of such change.

Even if the Exchange Offers are completed, they may not be completed on the schedule described in this Exchange
Offer Memorandum. Accordingly, Eligible Holders who validly offer (and do not validly withdraw) their Existing
Notes for exchange may not withdraw such offers of Existing Notes for exchange later and may have to wait
longer than expected to receive their New Notes (or to have their Existing Notes returned to them in the event that
we terminate the Exchange Offers), during which time those Eligible Holders will not be able to effect transfers
of any Existing Notes offered for exchange tendered (and not validly withdrawn) in the Exchange Offers.
Settlement of the Exchange Offers may also become subject to litigation, which may delay or prevent settlement
of the transactions contemplated by this Exchange Offer Memorandum or require us to pay damages in the event
of an adverse judicial decision.

**_Exchange Instructions submitted by Sanctions Restricted Persons will not be accepted._**

A holder or beneficial owner of the Existing Notes who is, or who is believed to be a Sanctions Restricted Person
(as defined in this Exchange Offer Memorandum) may not participate in the Exchange Offers. No Exchange
Instruction submitted by a Sanctions Restricted Person will be accepted or counted, notwithstanding the purported
delivery (and non-withdrawal or revocation) of an Exchange Instruction by it in respect of the Exchange Offers
on or before the Expiration Time. The restriction described in this paragraph shall not apply if and to the extent
that it is or would be a breach of any provision of Regulation (EC) No. 2271/1996 (the “EU Blocking Regulation”)
or any law or regulation implementing the EU Blocking Regulation in any Member State of the European Union,

191


-----

or any blocking regulation in Switzerland or the United Kingdom or section 7 of the German Foreign Trade
Regulation (Außenwirtschaftsverordnung  AWV) in connection with the German Foreign Trade Law
(Außenwirtschaftsgesetz).

**_The Existing Notes will be blocked in the relevant Clearing System’s account for a period if you participate in_**
**_the Exchange Offers._**

When considering whether to offer Existing Notes for exchange in the Exchange Offers, Eligible Holders should
take into account that restrictions on the transfer of the Existing Notes will apply from the time of such offer. An
Eligible Holder will, upon validly offering (and not validly withdrawing) Existing Notes for exchange in the
Exchange Offers, agree that the tendered Existing Notes offered for exchange will be blocked in the relevant
account at the relevant Clearing System from the date of the relevant offer of Existing Notes for exchange is made
until the earlier of: (i) the time of settlement on the Settlement Date and (ii) the date of any termination of the
Exchange Offers (including where such Existing Notes are not accepted for exchange) or on which the Exchange
Instruction is validly withdrawn.

Upon blocking of the securities account where Existing Notes are held, holders of Existing Notes offered for
exchange should be aware that they may not transfer title to such Existing Notes to other persons and may suffer
losses if the market price of the Existing Notes changes and the Exchange Offers, in respect of that holder or
generally, is not completed for whatever reason. See “The Exchange Offers”.

**_You are responsible for complying with the procedures and applicable restrictions of the Exchange Offers._**

Eligible Holders are responsible for complying with all of the procedures required to participate in the Exchange
Offers. None of us, the Dealer Managers or the Exchange and Tabulation Agent assume any responsibility for
informing the Eligible Holders of any agent’s message or with respect to the acceptance of offers to exchange.
Prior to the Settlement Date, no assurance can be given that the Exchange Offers will be completed. This may
depend upon the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions of the Exchange Offers.

We will issue New Notes in exchange for your Existing Notes only if you validly offer (and do not validly
withdraw) the Existing Notes for exchange pursuant to the procedures and requirements of the relevant Clearing
System. You should allow sufficient time to ensure timely delivery of the necessary documents. None of the
Dealer Managers, the Exchange and Tabulation Agent nor we are under any duty to give notification of defects
or irregularities with respect to the offers of Existing Notes for exchange. If you are the beneficial owner of
Existing Notes that are registered in the name of your broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other
nominee, and you wish to offer the Existing Notes in the Exchange Offer, you should promptly contact the person
in whose name your Notes are registered and instruct that person to offer the Existing Notes on your behalf.

Beneficial owners of Existing Notes who hold such Existing Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream should note
the particular practices and policies of the relevant Clearing System regarding their communications deadlines,
which will determine the latest time at which offers of the Existing Notes for exchange and consents may be
delivered to the relevant Clearing System (which may be earlier than the deadlines set forth in this Exchange Offer
Memorandum) so that they are received by the Exchange and Tabulation Agent in respect of Exchange Offer
within the deadlines set forth in this Exchange Offer Memorandum. Furthermore, the Clearing Systems may
charge Eligible Holders fees in connection with an Eligible Holders participation in the Exchange Offers and
Eligible Holders will be liable for such fees.

It is important to note that all references in this Exchange Offer Memorandum to times, are to London time unless
we state otherwise.

Each Eligible Holder is referred to the offer restrictions herein. Eligible Holders are required to comply with these
offer restrictions and any non-compliance could result in, among other things, the unwinding of trades and/or
heavy penalties. See “The Exchange Offers”.

**_The Exchange Offers are subject to conditions and certain parts thereof are subject to separate conditions._**

The Exchange Offers are subject to the conditions specified herein and if such conditions are not satisfied or
waived, the Exchange Offers will be terminated. In particular, if the minimum amount of €500,000,000 Existing
Notes are not offered for exchange, the Exchange Offers will be terminated. See “The Exchange Offers”.
Furthermore, the Issuer intends to exchange no more than the Maximum Acceptance Amount of Existing Notes.
The Exchange Offers may be subject to proration if the aggregate principal amount (excluding accrued and unpaid
interest) of the Existing Notes that are validly offered for exchange (and not validly withdrawn) is greater than

192


-----

the Maximum Acceptance Amount. See ”The Exchange Offers— Acceptance Priority Levels; Maximum
_Acceptance Amount; Proration”._

We are not under any obligation to accept Existing Notes validly offered for exchange (and not validly withdrawn)
for exchange.

We are not under any obligation to accept, and shall have no liability to any person for any non-acceptance of,
any offer of Existing Notes for exchange pursuant to the Exchange Offers.

Existing Notes validly offered for exchange (and not validly withdrawn) may be rejected in our sole discretion for
any reason and we are not under any obligation to Eligible Holders to furnish any reason or justification for
refusing to accept validly offered for exchange (and not validly withdrawn) Existing Notes for exchange. For
example, validly offered for exchange (and not validly withdrawn) Existing Notes may be rejected if the Exchange
Offers are terminated, if the Exchange Offer do not comply with the relevant requirements of a particular
jurisdiction or for any other reason.

**_To participate in the Exchange Offers, Eligible Holders must offer Existing Notes for exchange in an aggregate_**
**_amount of at least €100,000._**

The New Notes will be issued with a minimum denomination of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000.
Accordingly, to participate in the Exchange Offers, Eligible Holders must validly offer (and not validly withdraw)
Existing Notes for exchange with an aggregate principal amount of at least €100,000. In order to be able to
participate in the Exchange Offers, an Eligible Holder holding Existing Notes of less than €100,000 must first
acquire such further number of Existing Notes as is necessary for that Eligible Holder to be able to validly offer
its Existing Notes for exchange.

**_Eligible Holders should consult their own tax, accounting, financial and legal advisers regarding their specific_**
**_tax or accounting consequences of participating or declining to participate in the Exchange Offers and an_**
**_investment in the New Notes._**

Eligible Holders should consult their own tax, accounting, financial and legal advisers regarding their specific tax
or accounting consequences of participating or declining to participate in the Exchange Offers or an investment
in the New Notes. None of the Issuer, the Dealer Managers or the Exchange and Tabulation Agent makes any
recommendation to any Eligible Holder of Notes as to whether such Eligible Holder should offer its Existing
Notes for exchange or refrain from offering its Existing Notes for exchange in the Exchange Offers, and none of
the aforementioned parties has authorized any person to make any such recommendation on their behalf.

Eligible Holders are notified that we have not provided any tax analysis in this Exchange Offer Memorandum that
is intended or written to be used or relied upon or that can be used or relied upon by any taxpayer for the purpose
of avoiding penalties. Eligible Holders should seek advice based on their particular circumstances in connection
with any decision to offer their Existing Notes for exchange in the Exchange Offers from a tax advisor.

**_We may repurchase any Existing Notes that are not offered for exchange in the Exchange Offers on terms that_**
**_are more favorable to Eligible Holders than the terms of the Exchange Offers._**

We intend to continue to explore options to address our debt maturity profile in the near-term and may, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, purchase or redeem Existing Notes from time to time in the open market, in
privately negotiated transactions, through subsequent tender or exchange offers, through the exercise of our
optional redemption rights under the Existing Notes Indenture or otherwise. These other purchases or redemptions
may be made on the same terms or on terms that are more or less favorable to Eligible Holders than the terms of
the Exchange Offers. We also reserve the right to repurchase or redeem any Existing Notes not offered for
exchange in the Exchange Offers. If we decide to repurchase or redeem Existing Notes on terms that are more
favorable than the terms of the Exchange Offers, those holders who decide not to participate in the Exchange
Offers could ultimately receive consideration in cash or other form that represents greater value for their Existing
Notes than the value received by Eligible Holders that participate in the Exchange Offers.

**_Eligible Holders may be subject to proration of their Existing Notes offered for exchange._**

The Exchange Offers may be subject to proration if the aggregate principal amount (excluding accrued and unpaid
interest) of the Existing Notes that are validly offered for exchange and not validly withdrawn is greater than the
Maximum Acceptance Amount. As a result, each Eligible Holder who validly offers (and does not validly
withdraw) Existing Notes for exchange pursuant to the Exchange Offers may have a portion of its validly offered

193


-----

(and not validly withdrawn) Existing Notes for exchange returned to it, and such amount of Existing Notes so
returned will depend on the level of participation of Eligible Holders in the Exchange Offers. Further, such amount
of Existing Notes to be returned to an Eligible Holder on account of proration, will continue to remain blocked
until the Settlement Date.

**_There are differences between the terms of the Existing Notes and the New Notes which could expose you to_**
**_additional risks if you tender your Existing Notes._**

While the New Notes terms will be substantially similar to the Existing Notes terms, certain material terms of the
New Notes terms will differ from the Existing Notes, including the issue date, a higher interest rate, different
interest payment dates, a longer maturity date, different redemption terms. In addition, the New Notes will not
benefit from a portability feature in connection with a change of control. These material differences could expose
you to additional risks if you tender your Existing Notes as part of the Exchange Offers, including in particular
the extend maturity and differing redemption terms. If you tender only some, but not all, of your Existing Notes
as part of the Exchange Offers, you will be exposed to risks in connection with both the Existing Notes and the
New Notes. For further information on the New Notes see “Description of the Notes,” “Questions and Answers
_Relating to the Exchange Offer” and “Overview of the Exchange Offer.”_

**_Exchange Instructions are irrevocable and may not be withdrawn._**

Each Exchange Instruction submitted by an Eligible Holder pursuant to the Exchange Offers is irrevocable and
cannot be withdrawn, except in the limited circumstances described under the heading “Procedures for
_Participating in the Exchange Offers—Withdrawal of Validly Offered for Exchange Existing Notes.”_

194


-----

###### USE OF PROCEEDS

The Issuer will not receive any cash proceeds from the issuance of the New Notes in the Exchange Offers. The
Cash Consideration, any accrued and unpaid interest in respect all Existing Notes validly offered (and not validly
withdrawn) and accepted by the Issuer for exchange from, and including, the most recent interest payment in
respect of such Existing Notes to, but not including, the Settlement Date and the fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Exchange Offers will be funded with the Group’s cash on hand. The Issuer has agreed to pay
the fees and expenses of the Dealer Managers, Exchange and Tabulation Agent and the Trustee, the Security
Agent and their respective agents and counsel, for services in connection with the Exchange Offers.

_____________

(1) Total cash, cash equivalents and term deposits held in Russia amounted to €93.4 million (equivalent) as of June 30, 2022. In August
2022, we repatriated approximately €40.0 million cash from our Russian subsidiary. In the “as adjusted” column, assumes that holders
of €500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes have submitted exchange instructions in the Exchange Offers and
received Cash Consideration in an aggregate amount equal to €40.0 million.

(2) Represents the aggregate principal amount drawn under the Senior Term Facilities, which includes euro denominated drawings and
sterling denominated drawings translated to euro using the June 30, 2022 exchange rate. The carrying amount of non-current
obligations under the Senior Term Facilities as of June 30, 2022, was €2,978.1 million (net of original issue discount (“OID”) and
deferred debt issuance costs).

(3) Represents the aggregate principal amount drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility as of the date of this Exchange Offer
Memorandum.

(4) Pursuant to the Exchange Offers, the Issuer is offering Eligible Holders the opportunity to exchange their Existing Notes for New
Notes to be issued by the Issuer, on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in this Exchange Offer Memorandum. The actual
amounts of Existing Notes and New Notes presented in the table above represents the aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes
and New Notes outstanding as of June 30, 2022. The carrying amount of non-current obligations under the of Existing Notes as of
June 30, 2022, was €1,874.5 million (net of OID and deferred debt issuance costs). The as adjusted amounts of Existing Notes and
New Notes presented in the table above represents the aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes and New Notes outstanding as

**Overview**

We are a leading healthcare and pharmaceuticals company focused on generics, consumer healthcare (“CHC”)
and specialty medicines with a successful track record spanning over 120 years. With more than 600 CMOs and
25,000 SKUs covering many therapeutic areas, we develop, manufacture and market a diversified product
portfolio that includes many category leaders. We distribute our products in approximately 120 countries and have
a direct presence in all major European markets, as well as in growth markets in the MENA region, Asia and
Australia.

We rank as the fourth-largest player by gross sales in Europe in the market for generics and OTC medicines,
according to IQVIA. Our market leading positions provide us with a competitive advantage, which is bolstered
by our scale, brands, reputation and the breadth and diversification of our product portfolio, as well as our local
market expertise and established distribution channels built on strong relationships with wholesalers and
pharmacies. We continually work to optimize and manage our costs, including through our cost-effective
manufacturing footprint comprising 20 production facilities across Europe and Asia. Building on our tried and
tested platform, we launched over 790 individual products in 2020 and over 980 in 2021. Our solid pipeline of
new products provides us with further opportunities as our markets grow. We have a strong track record of growth,
both organically and through focused acquisitions, and seek to grow our business and further improve our
profitability by internationalizing successful products. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, we generated
sales of €3,510.8 million and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of €912.4 million.

We have categorized our products into the following three divisions: Generics, Consumer Healthcare and
Specialty:

_Generics: Our Generics division comprises prescription drugs sold under an international non-proprietary name_
(“INN generics”). Generics offer a lower cost alternative to the substantially more expensive pharmaceutical
originator products. Most of the products in our Generics division require a prescription for purchase and are only
available from pharmacies and/or hospitals. The market for prescription products is generally characterized by
regulated pricing, with competition driven by the reliability of supply and cost competitiveness. Patent expirations
and loss of regulatory market exclusivity of originator drugs feed our product pipeline in the Generics division,
allowing us to leverage our distribution channels and local market knowledge to launch new generic products.
Our Generics portfolio is diversified, with the top ten products accounting for less than 18% of sales in our
Generics division for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. The top ten products by sales (and their respective
therapeutic areas) in our Generics division for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, were: Tilidine (pain &
relief), Atorvastatin (cardio), Amoxiclav (antibiotics), Pantoprazole (gastro), Omeprazole (gastro), Diclofenac
(pain & relief), Bisoprolol (cardio), Amlodipine (cardio), Ezetimibe (cardio) and Olmesartan (hypertension). The

198


-----

largest countries by sales in our Generics division for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, were Germany,
Italy, Belgium, Spain, Serbia, Switzerland, France, Vietnam, Russia and the Netherlands. We generated sales of
€1,377.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA of €336.4 million in our Generics division in the twelve months ended
June 30, 2022.

_Consumer Healthcare: Our Consumer Healthcare division comprises non-prescription medicines with regulatory_
status, such as OTC medicines or medical devices, cosmeceuticals and cosmetics, vitamins, minerals and
supplements (“VMS”) and certain consumer products such as the household disinfectant Zoflora. We market our
Consumer Healthcare products with a focus on product features, awareness and trust in the product or brand as
well as through endorsement by healthcare professionals such as pharmacists and doctors. While we have many
strong and large brands with leading positions in their respective markets, our portfolio of Consumer Healthcare
products is very diversified, with the top ten CHC products accounting for less than 29% of sales in our Consumer
Healthcare division for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. The top ten selling brands (and their respective
therapeutic areas) in our Consumer Healthcare division for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, were:
Cardiomagnyl (cardio), Zoflora (disinfectants), Nizoral (derma), Aqualor (cough & cold), Snup (cough & cold),
Paracetamol (pain & relief), Vitaprost (women & men’s health), Grippostad (cough & cold), Levomecol (derma)
and Artra (pain & relief). The largest countries by sales in our Consumer Healthcare division for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2022 were Russia, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Italy. We generated sales
of €1,450.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA of €388.1 million in our Consumer Healthcare division in the twelve
months ended June 30, 2022.

_Specialty: Our Specialty division comprises the following three product categories:_

- _Branded generics, which includes prescription generics sold under a brand name, as opposed to INN generics._

- _Specialty_ _generics as defined by IQVIA, which comprises prescription drugs for chronic, complex or rare_
diseases which also meet at least three of the following criteria: (i) high annual costs, (ii) initiated and
maintained by a specialist for drug therapy, (iii) special procedure required (refrigerated, frozen or prone to
other biohazards), (iv) reimbursement assistance required, (v) limited distribution and (vi) extensive
monitoring or comprehensive patient counseling required.

- _Biosimilars, which are biologic medicinal products that are equivalent to an existing originator product._
Unlike small-molecule drugs, biologics contain active substances from a biological source, such as living
cells or organisms are often produced using advanced technology. Examples of biologics include insulin,
growth hormones and monoclonal antibodies. Despite not having to be identical to the originator product,
biosimilars must nevertheless demonstrate bio-equivalence.

We are continually expanding our existing range of products in the Specialty division. The top ten Specialty
products accounted for approximately 59% of sales in the division in the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. Our
top ten Specialty brands with their corresponding generic names were Silapo (Epoetin Zeta biosimilar), Apo-go
(Apomorhine), which is marketed in several countries under brand names APO-go, MOVAPO and APOKYN,
Edarbi (branded generic of azilsartan medoxomil), Bortezomib STADA (subcutaneous, ready-to-use injection,
branded generic to Velcade), Movymia (biosimilar of Fosteo or Teriparatid), Xefocam (branded generic of
Lornoxicam), Ovayas (biosimilar of Avastin or Bevacizumab), Versatis, Vipidia (branded generic of alogliptin)
and Lecigon. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, our Specialty division generated sales of €682.9 million
and Adjusted EBITDA of €193.0 million.

**Operating Divisions**

We report our results of operations in three divisions, Generics, Consumer Healthcare and Specialty, which
accounted for 39%, 42% and 19%, respectively, of our consolidated sales in the twelve months ended June 30,
2022. Our divisions transact business with each other in the ordinary course of their operations. In accordance
with applicable transfer pricing rules, services between our divisions are charged at market prices.

Until the year ended December 31, 2020, we reported our results of operations under two divisions, Generics and
Branded Products. However, we have also presented throughout this Exchange Offer Memorandum our results of
operations under three division for the year ended December 31, 2019 because we believe this provides useful
comparative information for investors. We have altered our reporting segments to reflect our growth strategy,
including the increasing importance of the specialty pharmaceuticals portfolio. In the course of this change, we
compared the portfolio previously classified under Generics and Branded Products with current market

definitions, made a partial reclassification within the Generics and Consumer Healthcare divisions and added the
Specialty division

**Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition**

Factors affecting our results of operations and financial condition include the factors described below.

**_Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic_**

The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected global economies and financial markets, and
irregular development of business activities which impacted individual quarters. The first quarter of 2020 showed
strong demand due to, among other things, stockpiling by wholesalers, pharmacies and patients, while the second
and third quarters were characterized by purchasing restraint over prescription generics and branded products,
especially in the self-pay markets. The fourth quarter of 2020 saw a revival of demand.

In the first quarter of 2021, due to lockdowns as well as strict social distancing and hygiene regulations, demand
for cough and cold medicines was very low. In addition, there were fewer patient visits to hospitals and physicians
and pharmacies experienced lower demand for chronic disease medications as well. The second quarter of 2021
was significantly stronger than the comparative period in the prior year in the areas of prescription generics and
consumer healthcare products, especially in the self-pay markets. The second half of 2021 was generally
characterized by a further increase in demand with a correspondingly positive impact on business development,
although it was not yet reaching the pre-COVID-19 levels, due, in part, to various travel, business, social
distancing and other pandemic restrictions still in place in some countries. The first quarter of 2022 saw further
recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and good financial performance, especially in Germany and other key
European markets.

The comparability of our results for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and the years ended December 31, 2021
and 2020 with the corresponding prior periods, may therefore, be limited. We continue to closely monitor the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business to ensure the safety of our employees and be in a position to
quickly react to any operational developments, logistics disruptions and any adverse developments in our financial
condition, cash flows and liquidity. See “Risk Factors— _Our business, financial condition and results of_
_operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 public health_
_pandemic.”_

**_Conflict between Russia and Ukraine_**

The Russian Federation began an ongoing military invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, in response to
which Ukraine declared a state of emergency and requested defense assistance from other countries. The European
Union and the United States have suspended various Russian banks from the international financial
communication system SWIFT and imposed Sanctions on the Russian Central Bank. Furthermore, the European
Union and a number of other countries, including the United States, have imposed Sanctions on various Russian
industrial sectors, including energy, transport, technology and the media, as well as on certain banks, entities and
various individuals close to the Russian president and may impose increasingly stringent Sanctions going forward.
The Russian Federation has responded with counter-measures. These developments have led to a high degree of
uncertainty in the global financial markets and in particular, volatility in the exchange rate of the Russian ruble.
Pharmaceuticals and medical supplies are specifically exempted from Sanctions imposed by the European Union,
the United States and other countries, and the conflict has so far not had a material impact on our Russian
operations. Out of our humane duty to our patients and our responsibility to employees, we continue our operations
in Russia. Our manufacturing sites in Russia continue to operate largely without interruptions.

We operate two manufacturing facilities and several sales entities in Russia, which together employed
approximately 2,100 full time equivalents as of June 30, 2022, of which approximately 400 full time equivalents
were employed in production. In addition, we operate one manufacturing facility and carry out sales activities in
Ukraine, which together employed approximately 430 full time equivalents as of June 30, 2022. We do not operate
any manufacturing facility or own any assets in Belarus, which has been involved in the conflict, but have a local
marketing team, consisting of about 40 full-time equivalents as of December 31, 2021.

Our sales in Russia amounted to €488.7 million or 15% of our consolidated sales for the year ended December
31, 2021. Our Russian sales amounted to €247.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to
€204.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. Our other expenses for the Group increased to €662.5
million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, compared to €42.3 million in the previous period, due to
impairments of €642.8 million. The majority of impairment losses relate to the impairment of goodwill of €575.0

200


-----

million, primarily driven by the deterioration of the WACC used for impairment tests. Additionally, impairment
losses relate to various pharmaceutical approvals and trademarks as well as tangible assets. The impairments
relating to the Russian market in the six months ended June 30, 2022 are primarily attributable to four approvals
for Specialty products (€15.9 million), seven approvals in the Consumer Healthcare business (€14.5 million) and
one approval in Generics (€6.1 million), due to a mix of the increased interest rate and uncertain future prospects
for the Russian market.

Our manufacturing and commercial activities in Ukraine were largely put on hold after February 24, 2022, but we
were able to put our factory in Ukraine back into operation in May 2022. In the six months ended June 30, 2022,
we recognized impairments for intangible assets and tangible assets in Ukraine due to the increase in the country
market risk premium, which led to a significant increase in the country-determined WACC. As a consequence, an
impairment for three approvals for Consumer Healthcare products (€5.9 million) and for all tangible assets such
as machines and equipment (€17.3 million) was recognized. Our sales in Ukraine amounted to €33.3 million or
1% of our consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2021.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Sanctions imposed in connection with the Russian Federation, Russian
entities and certain Russian individuals have introduced significant uncertainty about the ability and willingness
of the Russian Federation and the affected individuals to honor their foreign currency debt obligations and our
ability to engage in any related transactions consistent with applicable sanctions. This default risk in combination
with abnormally high foreign currency volatility on the capital markets and the Sanctions against the Russian
Federation has resulted in Russia being excluded from the credit rating system. From an accounting perspective,
we are of the opinion that determining the country risk premium by applying the relevant credit rating is no longer
applicable for Russia and thus, is no longer a viable indicator of the risk relating to our investment in Russia via
investments in a local pharmaceutical company that is exempted from the Sanctions. The traditional approach of
IAS 36.A4-A6, where a single set of estimated cash flows is discounted with a WACC determined by country risk
premiums, which we followed until January 1, 2022, would thus lead to an inappropriate representation and
measurement of assets.

For the interim period from January 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022, we therefore, applied the so-called expected cashflow approach. Rather than discounting a single cash flow projection with a risk-adjusted WACC, we have taken
the uncertainty and risks induced by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine into account in the cash flow
projection of the underlying Russian business operations in the form of several scenarios with varying
probabilities of occurrence. In developing the future cash flow scenarios for our Russian business, we considered
the following variables: the development of the foreign exchange rate of the Russian ruble versus the euro and its
translational and transactional effects, the Russian inflation rate and its effect on cost of goods and services and
operational expenditure, our ability to compensate for the inflationary tendencies by pricing activities and the
change in market demand and our market share as well as our Marketing & Sales activities as a result. Based on
the varying set of values in these variables, we developed four scenarios and assigned with a probability of
occurring, which we determined based on expert interviews and analysis of financial market indicators:

 - Scenario A (base case) with a probability of 55%: moderate ruble devaluation and inflation with singledigit market contraction;

 - Scenario B (downside case) with a probability of 25%: significant ruble devaluation and inflation and
double-digit market contraction;

 - Scenario C (national bankruptcy case) with a probability of 15%: very significant ruble devaluation and
inflation and high double-digit demand contraction;

 - Scenario D (expropriation case) with a probability of 5%: worst case with a full discontinuation of the
business and cash flows in Russia.

Based on the four different cash-flow scenarios and their probability of occurrence, we have calculated a
probability-weighted cash flow which has then replaced the originally-budgeted cash flows of the Russian
business. In turn, we eliminated the Russian country-risk-premium from the discount-rate considerations since the
country risks have been reflected in the cash flows of the underlying operational business activities. The
aforementioned approach has been applied consistently for all relevant areas, performing goodwill impairment,
testing intangible and tangible assets associated with our Russian business. The approach was unchanged for the
remaining business, including Ukraine, as a credit rating is still available making it possible to determine a country
risk premium.

201


-----

In spite of the Sanctions against Russia and stringent capital controls within Russia, we continue to be able to
repatriate cash from Russia and transfer funds to Russian bank accounts held with local branches of nonsanctioned international banks. For example, we repatriated approximately €40 million cash from our Russian
subsidiary in August 2022. However, more stringent Sanctions, capital controls or other regulatory measures may
be imposed in the future.

The conflict between Russia and Ukraine gave rise to a world-wide increase in energy prices which have reached
multi-year highs, compounded by a general shortage of natural gas in certain of our key markets such as Germany.
Although we expect our energy costs to rise compared to recent years, our production processes are neither energyintensive nor dependent on natural gas and we are implementing price increases and cost efficiency measures. As
a result, we do not expect a material impact on our profitability.

We have recognized impairments amounting to €642.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The
impairments in the Russian market in the six months ended June 30, 2022 were primarily attributable to four
approvals for Specialty products (€15.9 million), seven approvals in the Consumer Healthcare division (€14.5
million) and one approval in Generics (€6.1 million), due to a mix of the increased interest rate and uncertain
future prospects for the Russian market. Furthermore, impairments occurred for intangible and tangible assets in
the Ukraine due to the increase in the country market risk premium which led to a significant increase in the
country determined WACC. As a consequence, an impairment for three approvals for Consumer Healthcare
products (€5.9 million) and for all tangible assets such as machines and equipment (€17.3 million) was
recognized. See “Risk Factors—Political instability and military action involving Ukraine, Belarus and Russia
_may affect our business and results of operations.”_

**_Regulation_**

Our industry is extensively regulated by a number of international and local regulatory authorities to ensure that
pharmaceutical products are effective and safe for use. Regulatory provisions typically require us to obtain
marketing authorizations before we are permitted to introduce new products into a market, which drives our
development costs. Other regulatory provisions establish high standards for the quality of our products, services,
raw materials, manufacturing and working conditions, which influence our cost of sales, selling expenses, and
general and administrative expenses. Conversely, these regulatory provisions also create natural barriers to entry
in the pharmaceutical markets in which we operate, which helps to protect our market share.

In addition, regulation significantly affects our pricing of products and profitability. In certain markets, such as
Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Serbia, the costs of prescription products are generally eligible for
reimbursement by third-party payors, such as government health programs. However, regulators set a reference
price for each pharmaceutical ingredient or substance group, which is a price limit that caps the amount
government health programs will reimburse. Pricing regulation generally benefits generics companies compared
to manufacturers of branded originator products. However, regulators may decrease their reference prices from
time to time.

Tenders are another cost containment measure, primarily employed by public institutions seeking to source
pharmaceuticals at the lowest price. Germany has a well-established public tendering system that covers the
majority of generic sales, in which we have operated successfully during the periods under discussion. Similar
tender systems are operated in the Netherlands and Spain. In Italy, the United Kingdom and Vietnam, tenders are
used for procurement by public institutions such as hospitals.

Cost containment measures by regulators and governments may also result in the redesignation of prescription
products as OTC products or the discontinuation of reimbursement for prescription products. We believe that
these measures play to our strengths, as consumers in need of pharmaceuticals that are no longer reimbursable are
more likely to prefer the less expensive generics that we offer over costlier originator products. Similarly, a
reclassification of a prescription product into an OTC product means that price regulations no longer apply,
thereby creating opportunities for us to leverage our brand recognition to charge more lucrative prices.

**_Volume Growth_**

We operate in a growing industry, which we believe influenced our sales during the periods under discussion and
represents a long-term trend. According to IQVIA, sales in the top 69 countries of the global generics market
increased from €214.7 billion in the year ended December 31, 2018 to €229.4 billion in the year ended December
31, 2019, slightly decreased to €228.6 billion in the year ended December 31, 2020, but increased to €237.7 billion
in the year ended December 31, 2021, with an average annual sales growth of 7.1% predicted from 2022 to 2026.

202


-----

Based on IQVIA data, the major European generics markets (Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Spain and
Italy) are expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.7% on average from 2022 to 2026, to €42.0 billion.

We believe growth in the global pharmaceuticals market is being driven by long-term trends such as population
growth, aging societies, increased incidence of chronic disease, advances in medical therapies, increasing selfmedication and health awareness. Growth in the global generics market is additionally driven by increasing
generics penetration in the global pharmaceuticals markets, due to cost containment regulations incentivizing the
use of generics to counteract the increasing cost pressure facing government sponsored health programs and
recognizing that generics provide a high quality and lower-cost alternative to originator products. Another key
driver behind increasing generics penetration is a wave of patent expirations.

In the generics space, we expect biosimilars to play an increasingly important role in the future, as they can
contribute significantly to cost control in national healthcare markets. In 2018, in Germany, the value of biologics
losing patent protection exceeded that of small molecule pharmaceuticals losing patent protection.

We also expect regulators to continue the trend of reclassifying prescriptions into OTC therapies, thereby
stimulating growth in the self-pay and self-care markets. According to IQVIA, the global OTC market is projected
to grow at a CAGR of 5.0% from 2022 to 2026 and the European OTC market is expected to grow at a CAGR of
1.8% over the same period.

**_Economic Conditions_**

We operate in the pharmaceuticals sector of the global healthcare industry, which is generally regarded as a
noncyclical industry. Noncyclical industries are characterized by a low correlation between the demand for their
products, which are typically nondiscretionary in nature, and fluctuations in general economic conditions.

We believe that sales in our Generics and Specialty divisions, which mostly comprise nondiscretionary
prescription products, are relatively independent of the economic conditions in our markets. As prices are mostly
regulated and frequently reimbursable by government or other health systems and as sales are partly driven by
chronic diseases, volume demand in the Generics and Specialty divisions are relatively stable throughout the
economic cycle. However, the state of a local economy may encourage governments to initiate cost containment
measures. Such measures may be favorable for us if they accelerate the transition from originator products to
generics or generics to branded OTC products, but they may be unfavorable if they lead to lower reference prices.
Examples of countries in which Generics and Specialty products account for the large majority of our sales include
Spain, Belgium, France and Italy.

The state of the economy, however, impacts our results of operations in our Consumer Healthcare division, which
mostly comprises self-pay OTC products, nutritional supplements and other consumer products. The lack of
reimbursement means that our Consumer Healthcare product sales partly depend on consumers’ disposable
income and general financial situation. A significant portion of our Consumer Healthcare division is
nondiscretionary, such as pain relievers, cough and cold medicines, sunscreens and diagnostics. However, some
of our Consumer Healthcare products are lifestyle driven and discretionary in nature, such as cosmetics and
vitamin supplements. Demand for these products is more susceptible to fluctuations in the overall economy.
Examples of countries in which our Consumer Healthcare products accounted for a significant portion of our sales
in the year ended December 31, 2021 include Germany, the United Kingdom, and Russia.

Our results of operations are also impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation. We experienced
raw-material and wage inflation in the six months ended June 30, 2022, which we estimate accounted for a singledigit percentage increase in our cost of goods sold. However, our gross margin actually improved to 43% in the
six months ended June 30, 2022, from 41% in the corresponding prior period as we were able to more than offset
inflationary cost increases through our ongoing transformation program, supply chain optimization, better
utilization rates and price increases on our Generic and Consumer Healthcare products. However, we expect high
inflation to continue for the second half of 2022 and cannot assure you that we will be able to offset any impact
of inflation to the same degree or at all in the future, which could adversely affect our profitability and
competitiveness.

**_Foreign Currency Exchange Rates_**

Due to our international business operations, we are subject to both foreign exchange transaction and translation
risk. We adjust our results to remove the distorting impact of exchange rate movements that affect the
comparability of our results for the periods presented. For example, in the six months ended June 30, 2022, we

203


-----

recorded foreign exchange gains of €64.0 million in connection with a loan for the acquisition of the Takeda
product portfolio.

Transactional risk arises when we and our subsidiaries execute transactions in a currency other than our respective
functional currency. We currently operate 20 manufacturing facilities in 12 countries, and sell our products in
approximately 120 countries. As a result, a significant portion of our sales and expenses are denominated in noneuro currencies. Where we are unable to match sales received in a foreign currency with expenses paid in the same
currency, our results of operations are affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. We believe that we are
generally able to match sales with expenses incurred in the same currency, such that part of our foreign exchange
transaction risk is naturally hedged. We also use derivatives such as currency futures and swaps to mitigate foreign
exchange risk.

We present our Financial Statements in euro. As a result, in the preparation of our Financial Statements, we must
translate assets, liabilities, income and expenses of all our operations with a functional currency other than the
euro into euro. Consequently, fluctuations in the applicable foreign currency exchange rates may increase or
decrease the euro value of our non-euro assets, liabilities, income and expenses, even if their value has not changed
in their local functional currency. Our principal exposure to translation effects relates to the British pound sterling,
Russian ruble and Serbian dinar.

**_Acquisitions and Disposals_**

Selective bolt-on acquisitions are part of our strategy, and we continually evaluate acquisition opportunities. We
seek to leverage acquisitions to unlock internal potential for organic growth, meaning that we typically acquire
either companies that we can use as a platform for our expansion into new geographic markets or product
portfolios that we can roll out in our numerous existing markets. Our focus in terms of acquisitions is on markets
that have high growth potential and on Consumer Health products, leveraging our commercial footprint and goto partner status for healthcare in Europe as well as the other markets in which we operate.

For example, in the year ended December 31, 2019, we acquired five skincare brands and a pediatric cough remedy
in Europe, APAC and Latin America from GlaxoSmithKline, and Biopharma’s pharmaceutical prescription and
consumer health business in Ukraine. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we acquired the Fern C Consumer
Health Business in the Philippines, the existing customer portfolio of Opti Pharm AG in Switzerland, multiple,
highly recognizable OTC brands and prescription medicines in Russia/CIS from Takeda, and the Walmark Group,
a leading OTC and food supplement provider in Central Europe. We also acquired another pharmaceuticals
portfolio from GlaxoSmithKline, consisting of 15 well established consumer healthcare brands. In the year ended
December 31, 2021, we acquired 16 well-established consumer healthcare brands across 13 countries from Sanofi,
including cold and flu, skincare and food supplement brands such as Silomat, Mitosyl and Frubiase. We also
acquired Friska LLC, a U.S. company selling branded food supplements. We also from time to time evaluate
divestment opportunities.

Although we have completed several acquisitions and disposals during the periods under discussion, no individual
acquisition or disposition materially affected the comparability of our results of operations. The Takeda
Acquisition represents our largest acquisition during the periods presented herein.

In addition, we have acquired, and may continue to acquire, additional shares in our existing subsidiaries from
time to time.

**_Strategic Initiatives and Restructuring Expenses_**

Our results of operations are affected by costs of strategic initiatives and restructuring expenses. We continue to
review our business processes with the aim of increasing automation, centralization and harmonization across our
international operations.

**_Seasonality_**

To a certain degree, our results of operations are affected by seasonality. For example, the results of our Consumer
Healthcare division typically fluctuate in line with the severity and timing of the cough and cold season, which
drives sales of our cold medicines such as Grippostad, Covonia, Aqualor, Snup and antibiotics in the fourth and
first quarter of each year. In a similar vein, the summer weather in the second and third quarters influences our
sales of sunscreen products such as Ladival. Our marketing expenses are subject to the same seasonal drivers.

**_New Product Launches_**

Our sales are impacted by the number of product launches in each year. Particularly in our large and mature
markets, product launches can be a key driver behind sales growth, as was the case especially in Germany and
Spain during the periods under discussion. Most of our product launches relate to new Generics. Because Generics
are not usually broadly advertised, these product launches have no material impact on our marketing expenses. In
our Consumer Healthcare division, however, our marketing expenses correlate with the number of product
launches, as the introduction of a new product is typically accompanied by marketing campaigns. When we
launched our successful and fast growing sleep aid Lunestil, for example, we incurred significant marketing
expenses for a TV and digital advertising campaign.

We launched 729, 798 and 988 products in the years 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. For example, recent
product launches include Lenalidomide (used for the treatment of multiple myeloma and lymphoma),
Bevacizumab (used for the treatment of a number of types of cancers) and Cabazitaxel (also used for the treatment
of cancer). The number of marketable products that we are able to launch in any year is partly driven by regulation
and the availability of new products and is thus partly outside our control. As part of our strategy to expand
globally into new markets, we are also launching internationally products that have been particularly successful
in their domestic markets. Recent examples include the launches of Viruprotect in European countries, Eunova in
China, Natures Aid portfolio in APAC, and Fultium in Belgium.

**Explanation of Key Income Statement Line Items**

Set forth below is a description of the key line items presented in our Financial Statements. Our key line items are
reported on the basis of uniform accounting policies that are implemented at each entity within our scope of
consolidation.

**_Sales_**

Sales are recognized when goods have been delivered or services rendered, provided that it is probable that
measurable economic benefits will flow to the entity and that control has been transferred to the buyer. It must
also be possible to reliably measure the company’s own costs incurred or to be incurred. Sales are recognized
before taxes and after deduction of revenue reductions (rebates or discounts) at fair value of the consideration
received or receivable. Expenses due to provisions for warranties are deducted from sales on the basis of estimates
that are based on past experience expressed as a percentage of sales. Discounts granted to health insurance systems
are recognized as a reduction of sales, based on the relevant contract. Income and expenses from the same
transactions are generally recorded in the same period. Expenses related to accruals for future revenue reductions
are thus recorded in the period in which the sales are realized.

See note 9 to the Topco Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021.

**_Cost of Sales_**

Cost of sales includes the costs of raw material inputs and their conversion into marketable products, including
directly associated personnel expenses, as well as depreciation charges related to the relevant production
equipment. In addition, cost of sales includes valuation allowances for excess or obsolete inventories and the
purchase price of commercial goods sold or provided free of charge. Cost of sales also includes amortization
charges against intangible assets recognized in connection with drug approvals and trademark rights. Cost of sales
is recognized in the same period in which the associated income is realized.

**_Selling Expenses_**

In addition to the costs for sales departments and sales forces, selling expenses also comprise the costs for
advertising and marketing activities, including samples for doctors. Selling expenses also include all costs for the
distribution of our products. Discounts in the form of free retail packages, which are referred to as discounts in
kind, are not included in selling expenses but in net sales.

**_General and Administrative Expenses_**

Personnel and material costs of service and administrative units are reported under general and administrative
expenses, unless they have been charged to other functional areas as internal services.

205


-----

**_Research and Development Expenses_**

Research expenses are costs that are incurred in relation to research activity aimed at new scientific or technical
findings. We do not engage in material proprietary research for new active pharmaceutical ingredients and our
product portfolio is focused on products that do not require proprietary research. As a result, we typically do not
incur material research expenses.

Development costs are costs that result from the technical implementation of theoretical discoveries in production
and production processes and costs resulting from their commercial implementation. As a rule, it is the objective
of our drug development process to obtain national or multinational marketing authorizations for our products, to
capitalize all development costs incurred in relation to these authorizations and to recognize them as intangible
assets. As described under “—Cost of Sales,” we then amortize these intangible assets as part of cost of sales.
Whenever development costs do not satisfy the requirements for capitalization, we expense them in the periods
in which they are incurred and report them under the line item development costs. Costs related to the development
of new products are usually capitalized, whereas costs for technical and regulatory maintenance or the
optimization of existing products are usually expensed as development costs.

Development costs must satisfy the following criteria in order to be capitalized: (i) it is technically possible for
the relevant product to become marketable or otherwise available for use in our business in the future (which
generally equates to the grant of a marketing authorization); (ii) we have the intention, ability and necessary
resources, to achieve the marketability or utility of the relevant product; (iii) it is probable that the future economic
benefits accruing from the intangible asset will flow to the Group; and (iv) the cost of the intangible asset can be
measured reliably.

**_Other Income_**

Other income primarily includes reversals of impairment losses and other write-ups on non-current assets
(excluding goodwill), income from asset disposals, income from insurance compensation and income from
indemnification payments as well as remaining other income not directly associated with functional costs.

**_Other Expenses_**

Other expenses primarily include bad debt expenses, currency translation expenses, impairment losses on noncurrent assets and certain taxes that cannot be meaningfully attributed to our sales, administration or research and
development functions.

**_Financial Result_**

Financial result is the net of financial income and financial expenses. Financial income primarily includes interest
income, distributions received from investments accounted for using the equity method and income from the
measurement of financial instruments. Financial expenses are mainly composed of interest expense and expenses
from the measurement of derivative financial instruments.

**_Income Tax Expenses_**

Income tax expenses include taxes on income and earnings paid or owed in the individual countries as well as
deferred taxes. Other taxes that cannot be meaningfully attributed to our sales, administration or research and
development functions are included in other expenses.

Consolidated Sales

Reported sales increased by €261.4 million, or 17%, to €1,768.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022,
from €1,506.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. Over the same period, adjusted sales increased by
€224.1 million, or 15%, to €1,768.1 million from €1,544.0 million. We adjust our sales to account for currency
effects. The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted sales to reported sales for the six months ended
June 30, 2022, as well as information for the six months ended June 30, 2021.

________________________________________

(1) The adjustment in respect of currency effects removes the distorting impact of exchange rate movements that affect the comparability
of sales for the periods presented. In calculating this adjustment we translate our non-euro denominated sales in the prior period at the
same foreign exchange rates as in the current period.

Applying the exchange rates of the six months ended June 30, 2022 for the translation of local sales contributions
into euro for the six months ended June 30, 2021 results in a positive currency effect on our previous year’s sales
of €37.2 million.

Constant currency Sales

Constant currency sales increased by €254.6 million, or 16%, to €1,872.1 million in the six months ended June
30, 2022, from €1,617.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021.

Sales by Operating Division

_Generics_

Reported sales in our Generics division increased by €50.6 million, or 8%, to €697.1 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2022, from €646.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. Growth in our Generics division
was achieved in a large number of countries, with the strongest contribution from Germany, Belgium, France and
Vietnam, which all grew by high single- to double-digit percentages. Over the same period, adjusted sales in the
Generics division increased by €42.4 million, or 6%, to €696.1 million, from €654.7 million. Generics had a share
of 39% of reported sales in the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to 43% in the six months ended June
30, 2021. Our top five active pharmaceutical ingredients accounted for sales of €79.8 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2022, or 12% of total sales in the Generics division, compared to €64.0 million, or 10%, in the six
months ended June 30, 2021. With sales of €25.2 million, an increase of €6.0 million, or 31%, from the six months
ended June 30, 2021, Tilidine was the best-selling active pharmaceutical ingredient in the Generics division in the
six months ended June 30, 2022.

_Consumer Healthcare_

Reported sales in our Consumer Healthcare division increased by €166.6 million, or 30%, to €729.2 million in the
six months ended June 30, 2022, from €562.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. Adjusted sales in
the Consumer Healthcare division increased by €146.3 million, or 25%, to €729.2 million in the six months ended

208


-----

June 30, 2022, from €582.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was driven by
normalization of demand following the demand pressures associated with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
in the corresponding prior period, in particular the weak incidence of cough and cold in the year ended December
31, 2021. The Sanofi acquisitions and distribution agreements also contributed to the sales growth. Apart from
the impact of acquisitions and cooperations, the increase was also due to market growth and market share gains,
new product launches and price increases in a large number of countries. All top-ten countries in the Consumer
Healthcare division contributed to growth rates in the mid-single-digit to high double-digit range, but the strongest
drivers of our sales growth in the Consumer Healthcare division were Germany, Russia and the Netherlands.

Consumer Healthcare had a share of 41% of reported sales in the six months ended June 30, 2022, compared to
37% in the six months ended June 30, 2021. Our top five Consumer Healthcare products accounted for sales of
€131.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, or 18% of sales in the Consumer Healthcare division,
compared to €109.6 million, or 19%, in the six months ended June 30, 2021. With sales of €43.2 million in the
first half of 2022, Cardiomagnyl was the best selling product in the Consumer Healthcare division in the six
months ended June 30, 2022.

_Specialty_

Reported sales in our Specialty division increased by €44.1 million, or 15%, to €341.8 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2022, from €297.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. Adjusted sales in the Specialty
division increased by €35.4 million, or 12%, to €341.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, from €306.4
million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. This growth was mainly attributable to gains in the area of
biosimilars, including (i) the successful launch of the cancer drug Ovayas (bevacizumab biosimilar), (ii) the
growth of the osteoporosis drug Movymia (teriparatide biosimilar), which was launched in 2020, (iii) the
increasing availability of Lecigon, an innovative gel formulation used to treat advanced Parkinson’s disease, (iv)
increased sales of Silapo (epoetin biosimilar) in Germany as well as related royalty income from the United States,
and (v) forward-buying effects. Specialty had a share of 20% of reported sales in the six months ended June 30,
2022, compared to 20% in the six months ended June 30, 2021.

_Cost of Sales_

Cost of sales increased by €112.6 million, or 13%, to €1,003.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022,
from €890.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The gross margin increased to 43% (from 41%). The
increase was due in part to cost optimization measures and efficiency improvements throughout the supply chain,
which, in the corresponding prior-year period, was subject to COVID-19-related negative impacts such as a higher
write-off rate in inventory. The gross margin was also positively impacted by the change in the country and
product mix, and price adjustments helped limit the negative effects of inflation in global procurement markets.

_Selling Expenses_

Selling expenses increased by €64.1 million, or 19%, to €404.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022,
from €340.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. This increase, which was slightly high compared to
the rise in sales, reflects both the effect of the partial reduction in sales activities in the previous year due to the
COVID-19 pandemic and targeted investments to expand the product portfolio in all divisions, as well as to
increase the market share of the existing portfolio. Our selling expense ratio to sales remained steady at 23% in
the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 23% in the six months ended June 30, 2021.

_General and Administrative Expenses_

General and administrative expenses increased by €9.2 million, or 8%, to €125.9 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2022, from €116.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was due, among other
things, to higher leasing and insurance costs.

_Research and Development Expenses_

Research and development expenses remained largely constant at €46.9 million in the six months ended June 30,
2022, up slightly from €43.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021.

_Other Income_

Other income increased by €85.8 million to €93.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, from €7.3 million
in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was mainly due to foreign exchange gains of €64.0 million

209


-----

in connection with a loan for the acquisition of the Takeda product portfolio in the six months ended June 30,
2022. Additionally, other income includes appreciation of intangible assets as a result of impairment testing,
amounting to €7.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022. The appreciation was a result of positive future
prospects in Russia attributable to five approvals for Specialty products (€6.8 million) and one approval for a
Consumer Healthcare product (€0.7 million).

_Other Expenses_

Other expenses increased by €620.1 million, or 1,465%, to €662.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022,
from €42.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was predominantly driven by impairments
of €642.8 million, a substantial portion of which related to the impairment of goodwill of €575.0 million primarily
driven by the deterioration of the WACC used for impairment testing.

Additionally, impairment losses related to various pharmaceutical approvals and trademarks as well as tangible
assets. The impairments in the Russian market in the six months ended June 30, 2022 were primarily attributable
to four approvals for Specialty products (€15.9 million), seven approvals in the Consumer Healthcare division
(€14.5 million) and one approval in Generics (€6.1 million), due to a mix of the increased interest rate and
uncertain future prospects for the Russian market. Furthermore, impairments occurred for intangible and tangible
assets in Ukraine due to the increase in the country market risk premium which led to a significant increase in the
country determined WACC. As a consequence, an impairment for three approvals for Consumer Healthcare
products (€5.9 million) and for all tangible assets such as machines and equipment (€17.3 million) was
recognized.

_Financial Result_

Our financial result improved by €10.6 million, or 8%, to net financial expenses of €127.3 million in the six
months ended June 30, 2022, from net financial expenses of €137.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021.
This improvement was partly driven by the recognition of financial income due to the fair value measurement of
an interest rate cap instrument as well as a positive effect recorded as financial income due to the increase in
underlying discount rate for the fair value measurement of the earn out liability in connection with the Lobsor
acquisition.

_Income Tax Expenses_

Income taxes expenses amounted to €25.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to an income
tax expense of €12.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The goodwill impairment was considered as
a discrete item without any corresponding tax effect.

_Key Earnings Figures_

Overall, our results of operations in the six months ended June 30, 2022, benefited from a broad-based growth
with most countries growing by high double-digit percentages. In addition to a continued normalization of the
market as the impact of COVID-19 has lessened when compared to the previous year as well as our product
launches and marketing and selling activities.

_Operating Profit and Adjusted Operating Profit_

Reported operating profit decreased by €462.0 million, or 572%, to a loss of €381.2 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2022, from a profit of €80.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The decrease was
primarily due to impairments of intangible and tangible assets, including an impairment for goodwill of €575.0
million. Despite a continued positive business outlook, the significant increase in the interest rate development
(as of June 30, 2022) is considered a triggering event and, hence, an impairment test was performed. Adjusted
operating profit increased by 41% to €340.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from €242.0 million
in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was based particularly on continued organic market share
gains as well as successful product launches that were well received by patients, doctors and pharmacists. A
recovery in demand combined with a better product mix and improvements in supply chain productivity further
contributed to the improved results. We also made lasting improvements in operating costs and continued to invest
in Marketing & Sales support.

_Net Income and Adjusted Net Income_

Reported net income attributable to controlling shareholders decreased by €468.2 million to a loss of €544.7
million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, from a loss of €76.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021.
Due to adjustments for special items, adjusted net income increased by €75.0 million, to €131.4 million in the six
months ended June 30, 2022 from €56.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021.

_EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA_

EBITDA increased by €142.3 million, or 45%, to €458.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, from
€316.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. Due to adjustments for special items, Adjusted EBITDA
increased by €98.9 million, or 33%, to €398.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from €299.8 million
in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The increase was attributable to higher sales in almost all major markets
and across Generics, Consumer Healthcare and Specialty. The disproportionate increase in Adjusted EBITDA
versus sales growth was due in particular to an increase in the gross margin resulting from price adjustments, a
favorable country mix and cost optimization measures as well as strict management of operating costs. Further,
the increase in EBITDA was driven by exchange rate income in connection with the loan for the acquisition of
the Takeda product portfolio.

EBITDA in our Generics division increased by €24.9 million, or 17%, to €171.1 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2022, from €146.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. This increase was due to a
normalization in demand across most countries, with the strongest contributions from Germany, France, and
Belgium. Furthermore, it was driven by the reversal of the adverse gross margin effects that resulted from the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results in the previous year (including effects relating to product and
country mix, sales deductions, and inventory write-offs). In addition, continuous efficiency measures in operations
and procurement were able to offset inflationary effects. The EBITDA margin in Generics was 25% in the six
months ended June 30, 2022 compared to 23% in the six months ended June 30, 2021. Adjusted EBITDA in our
Generics division increased by 17% to €171.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from €146.2 million
in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The Adjusted EBITDA margin of our Generics division was 25% in the
six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to 23% in the six months ended June 30, 2021.

EBITDA in our Consumer Healthcare division increased by €66.2 million, or 54%, to €189.9 million in the six
months ended June 30, 2022, from €123.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. This increase was due
to a normalized demand in the period compared to the depressed demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic
in the prior period, in particular the weak cough & cold incidence in 2021. Additionally, competitive pricing in
combination with efficiency measures in operations and return-on-investment-based operating expense
management drove the increase. The EBITDA margin in Consumer Healthcare was 26% in the six months ended
June 30, 2022 compared to 22% in the six months ended June 30, 2021. Adjusted EBITDA in our Consumer
Healthcare division increased by 53% to €189.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from €123.8
million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The Adjusted EBITDA margin of our Consumer Healthcare
division was 26% in the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to 22% in the six months ended June 30, 2021.

EBITDA in our Specialty division decreased by €13.6 million, or 13%, to €87.5 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2022, from €101.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The EBITDA margin in Specialty was
26% in the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to 34% in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The decrease
in EBITDA and the EBITDA margin in our Specialty division was primarily driven by an unfavorable product
mix, erosion in the price of Bortezomib, and investments made to ramp-up for new biosimilar launches and novel
treatments. Adjusted EBITDA in our Specialty division decreased by 7% to €87.5 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2022 from €94.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The Adjusted EBITDA margin of our
Specialty division was 26% in the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to 32% in the six months ended June
30, 2021.

_Special Items_

Adjusted for special items, earnings before taxes would have been higher by €91.7 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2022, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2021.

(1) The adjustment in respect of currency effects removes the distorting impact of exchange rate movements that affect the comparability
of sales for the periods presented. In calculating this adjustment we translate our non-euro denominated sales in the prior period at the
same foreign exchange rates as in the current period.

(2) Represents audited financial data for the years presented.

Applying the exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2021 to translate local sales contributions for the
year ended December 31, 2020 into euro, we showed a negative currency effect in the amount of €2.1 million or
(0.1)%. Currency developments therefore only had a marginal impact on our operating business in this period.

2021, from €3,187.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.

Sales by Operating Division

_Generics_

Reported sales in our Generics division increased by €22.4 million, or 2%, to €1,326.8 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021, from €1,304.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Adjusted sales in the Generics
division increased by €23.1 million, or 2%, to €1,326.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, from
€1,303.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was mainly due to sales increases in Europe.
Generics accounted for 41% of reported sales in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 43% in the year
ended December 31, 2020. Our top three active pharmaceutical ingredients accounted for sales of €95.5 million

ended December 31, 2020. With sales of €41.6 million, an increase of €0.2 million, or 1%, from €41.4 million in
the year ended December 31, 2020, Tilidin was the best-selling product in the Generics division in the year ended
December 31, 2021.

_Consumer Healthcare_

Reported sales in our Consumer Healthcare division increased by €163.6 million, or 15%, to €1,284.0 million in
the year ended December 31, 2021, from €1,120.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Adjusted sales

December 31, 2021, from €1,119.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition to acquisitions,
growth in reported sales resulted mainly from increased sales in CIS and Europe. Consumer Healthcare accounted
for 40% of reported sales in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 37% in the year ended December
31, 2020. In the year ended December 31, 2021, we achieved sales of €172.9 million from our three biggest
consumer healthcare products in terms of sales, compared to €147.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.
These products thus had a 13% share of sales in the year ended December 31, 2021 in the Consumer Healthcare
products division, compared to 13% in the year ended December 31, 2020. With sales of €79.5 million in the year
ended December 31, 2021, Magnyl was the best selling product in the Consumer Healthcare division in the year
ended December 31, 2021.

_Specialty_

Reported sales in our Specialty division increased by €53.2 million, or 9%, to €638.7 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021, from €585.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Adjusted sales in the Specialty
division increased by €53.4 million, or 9%, to €638.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, from €585.3
million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was based, in particular, on sales increases in Europe,
CIS and Germany. Specialty contributed to 19% of reported sales in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared
to 20% in the year ended December 31, 2020. With our three largest specialty pharmaceutical products in terms
of sales, we achieved sales of €223.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, or 35% of total sales in the
specialty pharmaceuticals, compared to €249.2 million (or 43%) in the year ended December 31, 2020. With sales
of €107.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, Epoetin Zeta was the best selling product in the Specialty

_Cost of Sales_

Cost of sales increased by €192.3 million, or 11%, to €1,878.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, from
€1,686.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to increased sales, higher
depreciation and amortization due to purchase price allocations as well as a changed product mix in the Generics
division and a changed product and country mix in the Specialty division.

_Selling Expenses_

Selling expenses increased by €67.4 million, or 10%, to €718.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021,
from €651.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was mainly due to higher marketing and

launches.

-----

_General and Administrative Expenses_

General and administrative expenses decreased by €15.8 million, or 6%, to €231.9 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021, from €247.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease partly resulted from
lower transformation and travel expenses.

_Research and Development Expenses_

Research and development expenses slightly increased by €1.6 million, or 2%, to €86.5 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021, from €84.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.

Other income increased by €21.6 million, or 67%, to €53.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, from
€32.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This was due to the re-measurement of earn-out liabilities in
connection with the acquisition of the Swedish company Lobsor Pharmaceuticals and the acquisition of additional
shares in the Vietnamese company Pymepharco in the previous year.

_Other Expenses_

Other expenses decreased by €121.5 million, or 49%, to €126.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021,
from €247.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was due to higher other expenses in the
previous year due to net foreign exchange expenses, significant expenses in connection with legal disputes and
expenses from deconsolidations.

_Financial Result_

Financial result decreased by €6.3 million, or 2%, to a loss of €269.2 million in the year ended December 31,
2021, from a loss of €262.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a
slight increase in interest.

_Income Tax Expenses_

Income tax expenses increased by €33.3 million, or 418% to €41.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2021,
compared to €8.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to high tax
expenses from a tax rate change in Great Britain.

_Key Earnings Figures_

Overall, our results of operations in the year ended December 31, 2021, benefited from favorable trends in sales
in Europe and CIS, particularly in Germany, linked with successful product launches and growth of top products.

_Operating Profit and Adjusted Operating Profit_

Reported operating profit increased by €136.7 million, or 109%, to €261.6 million in the year ended December
31, 2021, from €124.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Due to adjustments for special items, adjusted
operating profit decreased by €12.0 million, or 2%, to €576.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, from
€588.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.

_Net Income and Adjusted Net Income_

Reported net income attributable to controlling shareholders increased by €94.8 million, or 59%, to a loss of €65.7
million in the year ended December 31, 2021, from a loss of €160.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Due to adjustments for special items, adjusted net income decreased by €19.4 million, or 10%, to €178.7 million
in the year ended December 31, 2021, from €198.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.

_EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA_

EBITDA increased by €171.5 million, or 30%, to €752.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, from
€580.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Due to adjustments for special items, Adjusted EBITDA
decreased by €12.4 million, or 2%, to €694.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, from €707.2 million
in the period in the year ended December 31, 2020.

-----

EBITDA in our Generics division decreased by €27.6 million, or 8%, to €311.5 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021, from €339.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This development was due to a
declining gross margin, which was particularly affected by increased price erosion driven by the COVID-19
pandemic and related lockdowns as well as rising sales deduction ratios (including one-time effects). There was
also an unfavorable product mix, particularly as a result of a temporary decline in demand for antibiotics. The
EBITDA margin in Generics was 23% in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 26% in the year ended
December 31, 2020. Adjusted EBITDA in our Generics division decreased by €27.4 million, or 8%, to €311.5
million in the year ended December 31, 2021, from €338.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This
decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was due in part to the significantly higher special items in the previous year. The
Adjusted EBITDA margin of our Generics division was 23% in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to
26% in the year ended December 31, 2020.

EBITDA in our Consumer Healthcare division increased by €79.6 million, or 32%, to €330.8 million in the year
ended December 31, 2021, from €251.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Adjusted EBITDA in our
Consumer Healthcare division increased by 24% to €322.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 from
€260.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to a significant sales
increase as well as strict cost management, especially in the area of marketing expenses. Additionally, the prioryear figures were negatively impacted by a special item related to expenses for damages provisions. The EBITDA
margin in Consumer Healthcare was 26% in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 22% in the year
ended December 31, 2020. The Adjusted EBITDA margin of our Consumer Healthcare division was 25% in the
year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 23% in the year ended December 31, 2020.

EBITDA in our Specialty division remained almost steady at €206.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021,
compared to €207.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The EBITDA margin in Specialty was 32% in
the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 35% in the year ended December 31, 2020. Adjusted EBITDA
in our Specialty division decreased by €32.3 million, or 14%, to €200.1 million in the year ended December 31,
2021, from €232.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease in Adjusted EBITDA resulted
primarily from market-driven price erosions for Bortezomib, an unfavorable product and country mix, as well as
increased marketing and selling expenses to support the future growth of Lecigon and new products. The Adjusted
EBITDA margin of our Specialty division was 31% in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 40% in
the year ended December 31, 2020.

_Special Items_

Adjusted for special items, earnings before taxes would have been lower by €1.8 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.

(1) The adjustment in respect of currency effects removes the distorting impact of exchange rate movements that affect the comparability
of sales for the periods presented. In calculating this adjustment we translate our non-euro denominated sales in the prior period at the
same foreign exchange rates as in the current period.

(2) Represents audited financial data for the years presented.

Applying the exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2020 to translate local sales contributions for the
year ended December 31, 2019 into euro resulted in a negative currency effect in the amount of €47.5 million, or
(2.1)%.

Constant currency Sales

Constant currency sales increased by €520.5 million, or 20%, to €3,187.6 million in the year ended December 31,
2020, from €2,667.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.

Sales by Operating Division

_Generics_

Reported sales in our Generics division increased by €50.6 million, or 4%, to €1,304.4 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020, from €1,253.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Adjusted sales in the Generics
division increased by €56.4 million, or 5%, to €1,304.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, from
€1,248.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in each case was mainly attributable to sales
increases in Belgium, Germany, France and Switzerland. The acquired product portfolio of Opti Pharm majorly
contributed to the increase in reported sales in our Generics division in the Swiss market. Generics accounted for
a 43% share in our sales in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 48% in the year ended December 31,
2019. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we achieved sales amounting to €92.7 million with products that
contain our three best-selling active pharmaceutical generic ingredients. These products thus had a 7% share of
sales in the Generics division in the year ended December 31, 2020, consistent with the previous year. With sales
of €41.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of €3.2 million, or 8%, from €38.2 million in

the year ended December 31, 2020, from €870.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Adjusted sales in
the division increased by €283.5 million, or 29%, to €1,120.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from
€836.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in adjusted sales was primarily due to the
successful integration of acquired brands in Russia and Eastern and Western Europe as well as positive
developments in core markets such as Russia and the United Kingdom. Consumer Healthcare accounted for 37%
of reported sales in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 33% in the year ended December 31, 2019.
Our top five Consumer Healthcare products accounted for sales of €222.8 million in the year ended December 31,
2020, or 20% of sales in the Consumer Healthcare division, compared to €176.7 million, or 20%, in the year ended
December 31, 2019. With sales of €59.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of €17.9
million, or 43%, from €41.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, Zoflora was the best-selling active
pharmaceutical ingredient in the Consumer Healthcare division in the year ended December 31, 2020.

_Specialty_

Reported sales in our Specialty division increased by €101.1 million, or 21%, to €585.5 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020, from €484.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Adjusted sales in the division
increased by €109.3 million, or 23%, to €585.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from €476.2 million
in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in adjusted sales was primarily due to continuous growth of
top products, such as Epoetin Zeta, and the contribution of the Takeda Acquisition. Specialty accounted for 20%
of reported sales in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 19% in the year ended December 31, 2019.
Our top five Specialty products accounted for sales of €296.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, or
51% of sales in the Specialty division, compared to €264.4 million, or 55%, in the year ended December 31, 2019.
With sales of €100.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of €21.4 million, or 27%, from
€78.8 million in the previous period, Epoetin Zeta was the best-selling product in the Specialty division in the
year ended December 31, 2020.

_Cost of Sales_

Cost of sales increased by €269.0 million, or 19%, to €1,686.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, from
€1,417.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This development was mainly based on increased sales,
increased depreciation due to purchase price allocations, increased procurement costs arising from the COVID19 pandemic, and a changed product mix.

_Selling Expenses_

Selling expenses increased by €69.6 million, or 12%, to €651.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2020,
from €581.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was mainly attributable to the acquisitions
made in the period.

_General and Administrative Expenses_

General and administrative expenses increased by €19.0 million, or 8%, to €247.6 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020, from €228.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was driven in part
by the acquisitions made in the period.

_Research and Development Expenses_

Research and development expenses increased by €12.1 million, or 17%, to €84.9 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020, from €72.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Other Income_

Other income decreased by €1.9 million, or 6%, to €32.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, from
€34.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due, among other things, to lower income
from the reversal of impairments for trade accounts receivable and from the disposal of non-current assets.

_Other Expenses_

Other expenses increased by €43.3 million, or 21%, to €247.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, from
€204.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase resulted in particular from the establishment
of provisions for damages, increased exchange rate expenses, primarily in connection with a loan for the
acquisition of the Takeda product portfolio, and expenses from deconsolidations in connection with the sales of
the British subsidiaries Slam Trading Limited and LAS Trading Limited and the Argentinian subsidiary
Laboratorio Vannier.

_Financial Result_

Financial result decreased by €58.9 million, or 29%, to a loss of €262.8 million in the year ended December 31,
2020, from a loss of €203.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The largest individual item in this
regard was the interest expense of €273.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, while the largest
individual item was an interest expense in the amount of €213.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Income Tax Expenses_

Income tax expenses amounted to €8.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to an income tax
benefit of €13.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Key Earnings Figures_

Overall, our results of operations in the year ended December 31, 2020, benefited from favorable trends in sales
in CIS, Europe and the United Kingdom, as well as from acquisitions.

_Operating Profit and Adjusted Operating Profit_

Reported operating profit decreased by €13.2 million, or 10%, to €124.9 million in the year ended December 31,
2020, from €138.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Due to adjustments for special items, adjusted
operating profit increased by €100.0 million, or 20%, to €588.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020,
from €488.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Net Income and Adjusted Net Income_

Reported net income attributable to controlling shareholders decreased by €96.5 million, or 151%, to a loss of
€160.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, from a loss of €64.0 million in the year ended December
31, 2019. Due to adjustments for special items, adjusted net income increased by €2.6 million, or 1%, to €198.1
million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from €195.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.

_EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA_

EBITDA increased by €2.1 million to €580.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, from €578.5 million
in the year ended December 31, 2019. Due to adjustments for special items, Adjusted EBITDA increased by
€107.8 million, or 18%, to €707.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from €599.4 million in the year
ended December 31, 2019.

EBITDA in our Generics division remained almost steady, at €339.1 million in the year ended December 31,
2020, compared to €340.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This was primarily due to the impact of
COVID-19 effects and lockdowns (particularly in the second quarter, which had negative effects on our gross
margin), offset by a sales increase based on stable and growing market shares as well as tight operational
expenditure (“OPEX”) management. The EBITDA margin in Generics was 26% in the year ended December 31,
2020, compared to 27% in the year ended December 31, 2019. Adjusted EBITDA in our Generics division
decreased by €1.7 million to €338.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from €340.5 million in the year
ended December 31, 2019. The Adjusted EBITDA margin of our Generics division was 26% in the year ended
December 31, 2020, compared to 27% in the year ended December 31, 2019.

EBITDA in our Consumer Healthcare division increased by €27.9 million, or 12%, €251.2 million in the year
ended December 31, 2020, compared to €223.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was
primarily due to the positive development in Russia from the acquisition of Walmark (nine months of which were
reflected in our results in the year ended December 31, 2020) and in the UK, due to fast growth in the disinfection
segment during the COVID-19 pandemic. The EBITDA margin in Consumer Healthcare was 22% in the year

-----

ended December 31, 2020, compared to 26% in the year ended December 31, 2019. Adjusted EBITDA in our
Consumer Healthcare division increased by €37.0 million, or 17%, to €260.5 million in the year ended December
31, 2020 from €223.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The Adjusted EBITDA margin of our
Consumer Healthcare division was 23% in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 27% in the year ended
December 31, 2019.

EBITDA in our Specialty division decreased by €13.0 million, or 6%, to €207.6 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020, from €220.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due
to expenses connected with settlement of legal damages related to our anti-cancer drug Pemetrexed in 2020. The
EBITDA margin in Specialty was 35% in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 46% in the year ended
December 31, 2019. Adjusted EBITDA in our Specialty division increased by €9.0 million, or 4%, to €232.4
million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from €223.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The
Adjusted EBITDA margin of our Specialty division was 40%, compared to 47% in the prior comparative period.

_Special Items_

When adjusting for special items, earnings before taxes would have been higher by €45.0 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Overview_**

Our principal sources of liquidity on an ongoing basis are our operating cash flows and financing cash flows from
drawings under our Revolving Credit Facility and factoring facilities. The availability of the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities, including the Revolving Credit Facility, are subject to certain conditions. As of the date of this Exchange
Offer Memorandum, the Revolving Credit Facility is undrawn.

Our ability to generate operating cash flows depends on our operating performance, which in turn depends to
some extent on general economic, financial, industry, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our
control, as well as other factors discussed in “Risk Factors.” Our operating results in the year ended December
31, 2021, and in particular the first half of the year, were still affected by COVID-19, in particular due to a softer
demand across various product categories (e.g., cough & cold) and adverse Gross Margin effects (especially price
erosion, gross-to-net increase and under-absorption). As of June 30, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of
€339.8 million and we had €400.0 million in borrowings capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility.

We believe that, based on our level of operations as reflected in our results of operations for the six months ended
June 30, 2022, our cash flows from operating activities, cash on hand and the availability of borrowings under
factoring facilities and local facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditures and to
service our debt for at least the next twelve months. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make
other payments to us may be restricted by, among other things, legal prohibitions on such payments or otherwise
distributing funds to us, including for the purpose of servicing debt. Losses or other events could further reduce
the net equity and distributable reserves of our subsidiaries.

We anticipate that we will be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future and our ability to generate future
financing cash flows will be limited by the Indentures and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which may have
important negative consequences for you. See “Risk Factors,” “Description of the New Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.” In addition, any_
additional indebtedness that we do incur could reduce the amount of our cash flow available to make payments
on our then existing indebtedness, including under the New Notes offered hereby, and increase our leverage.

**_Cash Flows_**

The following table summarizes the cash flows on a consolidated basis for the years ended December 31, 2019,
2020, and 2021, and for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022.

(3) In the year ended December 31, 2020, we changed the presentation of interest paid in accordance with IAS 8 to report it under Investing
Cash Flow instead of Operating Cash Flow. The financial information for the year ended December 31, 2019 presented in the table above
and the comparison below, have been retrospectively adjusted and reflect the modified presentation and have been taken from
comparative financial information for the year ended December 31, 2019 included in the Topco Audited Financial Statements as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2020.

**_Six months ended June 30, 2022 Compared with Six Months Ended June 30, 2021_**

Operating Cash Flow

Operating Cash Flow increased by €120.4 million, or 67%, to a cash inflow of €299.8 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2022, from a cash inflow of €179.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. This
development was primarily based on an increase in EBITDA adjusted for material non-cash effects and thus the
gross cash flow in connection with an active operational liquidity management, especially regarding working
capital. In addition, there were considerably lower payments for health insurance discounts in Germany.

Investing Cash Flow

Investing Cash Flow decreased by €25.3 million, or 36%, to a cash outflow of €96.5 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2022, from a cash outflow of €71.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. Investing cash
flow in the reporting period was mainly influenced by investments in intangible assets. In the reporting period, a
total of €51.1 million, compared to €30.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021, was spent on acquisitions
including previous business combinations in accordance with IFRS 3 (including VAT) and significant investments
in intangible assets for the expansion of the product portfolio.

Financing Cash Flow

Financing Cash Flow activities decreased by €281.6 million, or 138%, to a cash outflow of €485.2 million in the
six months ended June 30, 2022, from a cash outflow of €203.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021.
The decrease mainly resulted from settlements of financial liabilities including the scheduled repayment of
STADA’s senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of €267.3 million, as well as interest
payments. In addition, there were payments from changes in non-controlling interests relating to the final earnout payments in connection with further share acquisitions in the Vietnamese subsidiary Pymepharco made in
year ended December 31, 2020.

**_Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2020_**

Operating Cash Flow

Operating Cash Flow increased by €219.9 million, or 56%, to a cash inflow of €613.9 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021, from a cash inflow of €394.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was
mainly attributable to significantly lower cash outflows from working capital, particularly for inventories and
trade accounts receivables. The decrease in other non-cash income and expenses compared with the previous year
resulted, on the one hand, from significantly higher additions to provisions for damages in the previous year,
particularly in Germany and the CIS region and, on the other hand, from significant income from the adjustment
of earn-out liabilities recognized in profit or loss and income from the reversal of provisions for damages in the
year ended December 31, 2021 recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020.

Investing Cash Flow

Investing Cash Flow increased by €917.5 million, or 75%, to a cash outflow of €307.8 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021, from a cash outflow of €1,225.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash outflows
for investments in intangible assets amounted to €236.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared
to €433.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Of this amount, €206.3 million (compared to
€407.8 million the previous year) was attributable to payments for significant investments in intangible assets for
product portfolio expansion, particularly the Sanofi acquisition. In the context of business combinations, net cash
outflows resulted mainly from the acquisition of Friska LLC. This was offset by sales tax refunds for the purchase
price payments made in the previous year related to the Takeda Acquisition.

In the year ended December 31, 2021, we spent a total of €201.2 million on significant investments and
acquisitions, compared to €1,138.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.

Payments for investments in property, plant and equipment amounted to €78.6 million in the year ended December
31, 2021 compared to €64.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This includes investments in
production, manufacturing and laboratory facilities, for which additions of €65.7 million were recorded in the year
ended December 31, 2021 compared to €42.5 million recorded in the year ended December 31, 2020. Payments
for investments in financial assets in the year ended December 31, 2021 were €1.0 million, compared to €1.1
million in the year ended December 31, 2020.

As a result of disposals, we recorded a payment inflow of €2.8 million from investing activities in the year ended
December 31, 2021, compared to €4.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.

Financing Cash Flow

Financing Cash Flow decreased by €904.9 million, or 100%, to a cash inflow of €4.2 million in the year ended
December 31, 2021, from a cash inflow of €909.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This development
was based in particular on significantly lower cash inflows from the raising of financial liabilities and higher
interest payments. In the year ended December 31, 2021, there were higher borrowings enabled by an increase in
commitments for Facility F equivalent to €350.0 million under the existing syndicated loan agreement of Nidda
Healthcare Holding GmbH. In the year ended December 31, 2020, significant borrowings resulted mainly from
the issuance by the Issuer of Existing Notes with a total nominal value of €550.0 million and further credit
facilities under the syndicated loan agreement with a total nominal amount of €260.0 million. In addition, in the
year ended December 31, 2020 there were payments from an escrow account in connection with the issuance by
the Issuer of Existing Notes in the fourth quarter of 2019 with a nominal value of €600.0 million to finance the
Takeda Acquisition, the closing of which took place in the first quarter of 2020. In contrast, there were lower cash
outflows from the repayment of financial liabilities compared with the previous year, which in the year ended
December 31, 2021 related, among other things, to the scheduled repayment of promissory note loans in the
amount of €41.5 million. In addition, payments from the change in minority interests in connection with further
share acquisitions in the Vietnamese subsidiary Pymepharco were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2021.
In the previous year, however, this item was characterized by significantly higher payments, which were
significantly influenced by the acquisition of additional shares in STADA from minority shareholders as well as
payments in the context of the squeeze-out.

**_Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2019_**

Operating Cash Flow

Operating Cash Flow decreased by €90.5 million, or 19%, to a cash inflow of €394.0 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020, from a cash inflow of €484.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This development
was mainly driven by increased cash outflows from working capital, especially for inventories and trade accounts
receivable. This resulted, among other things, from a build-up of working capital to pre-finance sales in connection
with companies and product portfolios acquired in the year ended December 31, 2020 during their association
with the Group. There were also higher income tax payments than in the previous year.

Investing Cash Flow

Investing Cash Flow decreased by €960.4 million, or 362%, to a cash outflow of €1,225.3 million in the year
ended December 31, 2020, from a cash outflow of €265.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Investing
Cash Flow in the year ended December 31, 2020 was influenced in particular by €407.8 million of significant
investments in intangible assets for short-term product portfolio expansion. Of this amount, €313.1 million was

221


-----

attributable to the acquisition of the branded product portfolio from GlaxoSmithKline. There were also net
payments of €731.1 million in connection with the acquisitions of the Walmark Group, of pharmaceutical products
from the Takeda Group with associated processes (including VAT) and of Lobsor Pharmaceuticals. In the year
ended December 31, 2020, we spent €1,138.9 million in connection with significant investments and acquisitions,
compared to €182.6 million the previous year.

Payments for investments in property, plant and equipment were €64.7 million in the year ended December 31,
2020 compared to €82.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This also includes investments in
production, manufacturing and laboratory facilities of €42.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020
compared to €61.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively. Payments for investments in
financial assets in the year ended December 31, 2020 were €1.1 million, compared to €4.5 million in the year
ended December 31, 2019.

As a result of disposals, we recorded a payment inflow of €4.8 million from investing activities in the year ended
December 31, 2020, compared to €31.5 million in the previous year. In the year ended December 31, 2020,
payments from the disposal of shares in consolidated companies and from the disposal of non-current assets held
for sale resulted from the sales of Laboratorio Vannier, Slam Trading Limited and LAS Trading Limited.

Financing Cash Flow

Financing Cash Flow increased by €1,281.5 million, or 344%, to a cash inflow of €909.0 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020, from a cash outflow of €372.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This
development was mainly attributable to significantly higher cash inflows from the assumption of financial
liabilities. Among other things, the Issuer issued Existing Notes with a nominal value of €350.0 million in the first
quarter of 2020. The Issuer issued additional Existing Notes with a nominal value of €200.0 million in the second
quarter of 2020. Under the syndicated loan agreement, a further credit facility with a total nominal amount of
€260.0 million was made available to the Company. In addition, further loans were taken out in the Group. In
addition, there were proceeds from the issuance of Existing Notes with a nominal value of €600.0 million issued
in the fourth quarter of 2019 and held in an escrow account in order to finance the Takeda Acquisition, which was
completed in the first quarter of 2020. In addition, Financing Cash Flow was significantly influenced by the
acquisition of additional shares in STADA from minority shareholders as well as payments in the context of the
squeeze-out. Further payments from the change in minority interests resulted in connection with further share
acquisitions in the Vietnamese subsidiary Pymepharco.

Net Working Capital

Net working capital as defined by us consists of inventories and trade accounts receivables less trade accounts
payables. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” The
following table summarizes our change in net working capital in terms of cash flows for the periods indicated:

In the six months ended June 30, 2022, our change in net working capital was a cash outflow of €74.2 million,
compared to a cash outflow of €57.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The change in inventories
accounted for a cash outflow of €93.8 million and was primarily due to an increase in inventories in our
subsidiaries in Germany, Serbia, the UK, Spain and Italy, mainly as a result of stock build-up in preparation for
sales in the second half of the year ended December 31, 2022, safety stock and launches. The change in trade
accounts receivable accounted for a cash outflow of €22.3 million, driven by an increase in trade accounts
receivable, mainly in our subsidiaries in Germany due to a lower factoring ratio applied at cut-off date. The change
in trade accounts payable accounted for a cash inflow of €41.9 million and resulted primarily from an increase in

222


-----

trade accounts payable in our subsidiaries in Germany and Serbia, mainly influenced by cut-off date effects and
as a result of stock build-up.

In the year ended December 31, 2021, our change in net working capital was a cash outflow of €46.3 million,
compared to a cash outflow of €346.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in inventories
accounted for a cash outflow of €32.0 million and was primarily due to an increase in inventories in our
subsidiaries in Russia (mainly driven by sales and build-ups of out-of-stock products as well as procurement for
the new season) and Serbia. The change in trade accounts receivable accounted for a cash outflow of €47.2 million,
driven by an increase especially in our subsidiaries in Italy (lower factoring volume compared to previous financial
year) and Serbia, but also various other companies, while Russian subsidiaries decreased trade accounts receivable
as a result of faster payment terms negotiated with major customers in the year ended December 31, 2021. The
change in trade accounts payable accounted for a cash inflow of €32.9 million and resulted primarily from an
increase in trade accounts payable in our subsidiaries in Spain, Denmark, Serbia and Vietnam, mainly influenced
by cut-off date effects.

In the year ended December 31, 2020, our change in net working capital was a cash outflow of €346.3 million,
compared to a cash outflow of €128.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in inventories
accounted for a cash outflow of €279.8 million, mainly in order to secure supply, which was impacted by a sales
slowdown due to market contraction across key countries and our acquisitions of companies and product portfolios
in the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in trade accounts receivable accounted for a cash outflow of
€115.1 million, mainly as a result of business expansion following acquisitions, especially in Russia. The change
in trade accounts payable accounted for a cash inflow of €48.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 and
resulted primarily from an increase in trade accounts payable in our subsidiaries in Russia and Germany, mainly
influenced by cut-off date effects.

**_Capital Expenditures_**

Our capital expenditures mainly consist of investments in maintenance (including replacements) and growth
expenditures (which relate to our expansion into new markets and increased penetration of existing markets). We
finance our capital expenditures with Operating Cash Flow and Financing Cash Flow.

The table below sets forth our capital expenditures based on cash flows for the periods indicated.

(1) Significant investments and acquisitions relate to payments for significant investments in intangible assets for the short-term expansion
of the product portfolio and payments for investments in business combinations in accordance with IFRS 3 (including VAT).

(2) Adjusted capital expenditure includes maintenance, other investments in tangible assets and financial assets as well as other minor
investments in various intangible assets.

Capital expenditures for significant investments and acquisitions increased by €20.4 million, or 66%, to €51.1
million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, from €30.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. This
increase was primarily due to higher investments in material intangible assets, especially biosimilars. Adjusted
capital expenditures increased by €4.8 million, or 12%, to €46.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022,
from €41.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. This increase was mainly due to higher investments in
tangible assets in, for example, Germany and Russia.

Capital expenditures for significant investments and acquisitions decreased by €937.7 million, or 82%, to €201.2
million in the year ended December 31, 2021, from €1,138.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This
decrease was primarily due to significantly higher investments in material intangible assets and business
combinations in the previous year, including the acquisition of a branded product portfolio from GlaxoSmithKline,
the Walmark Acquisition, the Takeda Acquisition with associated processes (including VAT) and the acquisition
of the Swedish Lobsor Pharmaceuticals. In the year ended December 31, 2021, there were lower investments in
material intangible assets and business combinations, including the acquisition of a product portfolio from Sanofi

223

and the acquisition of Friska LLC. Adjusted capital expenditures increased by €18.1 million, or 20%, to €109.4
million in the year ended December 31, 2021, from €91.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This
increase was mainly driven by higher investments in tangible assets, especially for the expansion of production
facilities in Romania.

Capital expenditures for significant investments and acquisitions increased by €956.3 million, or 524%, to
€1,138.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, from €182.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.
This increase was primarily due to significant investments in material intangible assets and business combinations,
relating mainly to the acquisition of the branded product portfolio from GlaxoSmithKline, the Walmark
Acquisition, the Takeda Acquisition with associated processes (including VAT), and the acquisition of Lobsor
Pharmaceuticals. Adjusted capital expenditures decreased by €22.6 million, or 20%, to €91.3 million in the year
ended December 31, 2020, from €113.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly
driven by lower investments in tangible assets, especially in Vietnam.

**Off Balance Sheet Arrangements**

We are not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or
future material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We license certain of our Generics
products, none of which individually represents a material portion of our business. In the six months ended June
30, 2022, the majority of our product returns were due to returns of excess stock by certain customers in our
Consumer Healthcare division. We also regularly enter into guarantees of indebtedness drawn by other entities
within our Group. In addition, as of June 30, 2022, obligations of €44.3 million relating to lease agreements that
were not recorded on our balance sheet in line with IFRS 16 existed.

224


-----

**Developments in any of these risk areas could have a material effect on our results.**

Risks that could have a significant influence on the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the
Group are described below. Risks are reported in the form of net risks, i.e., risks that include the measures taken
to manage the risk, and by the individual divisions. If no division is explicitly referenced, the described risks affect
all three divisions (Generics, Consumer Healthcare, and Specialty). As yet unknown risks and those that have
been assessed as insignificant could also influence net assets, financial position and results of operations.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Financial Risks**

We have exposure to liquidity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk, default risk, transfer price risk, impairment
risk and tax risk. Our risk management policies are established to identify and analyze the risks we face. We
counter financial risks with finance policy methods and specific risk management. Developments in any of these
risk areas could have a material effect on our results. See “Risk Factors” and the Financial Statements included
elsewhere herein for further details on these and other risks we face.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risks may result, for example, from the loss of existing cash items, the lack of available credit, reduced
access to financing markets or fluctuations in the operational course of our business. The objective of our liquidity
management is to ensure the solvency and financial flexibility of our Group at all times through sufficient liquidity
reserves and ready access to credit lines. Our financing comprises short-term and long-term borrowings from
banks, promissory notes, bonds and factoring. Furthermore, we generate substantial operating cash flows and have
access to credit financing from various banks that can be utilized as needed.

**_Currency Risk_**

Due to our international business operations, we are subject to risks arising from exchange rate fluctuations. These
particularly result from fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, Russian ruble, British pound sterling and Serbian dinar in
relation to the euro. A currency risk consists of potential changes in value, especially of receivables and liabilities
in a currency other than the respective functional currency, or as a result of exchange rate fluctuation (transaction
risk). However, we believe that we can mitigate this risk to a certain extent through natural hedges and the use of
derivative financial instruments. These are used to hedge currency risks from operating activities, financial
transactions and investments. In the six months ended June 30, 2022, to manage our currency risk we used a
combination of foreign exchange futures contracts and interest and currency swaps. The maturity dates of forward
contracts are generally set as necessary to match our anticipated cash flows. The remaining terms of the contracts
are currently up to one year.

Furthermore, currency risks also exist in relation to the translation of the balance sheet items, as well as the
conversion of income and expenses of subsidiaries outside the Eurozone (translation risk). In this connection, the
current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, as well as ongoing negotiations and developments between the
United Kingdom and the European Union in connection with Brexit, could directly and indirectly continue to have
a negative impact on exchange rates and our results of operations.

For example, a currency sensitivity analysis (translation risk) on the basis of our foreign currency items as of
December 31, 2021 showed that in the year ended December 31, 2021, an appreciation or devaluation of the
functional currency compared with the Russian ruble by 10% would have led to a change in our EBITDA of
approximately €23.6 million, compared to €27.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. At the same time,
an appreciation or devaluation of the functional currency in relation to the British pound sterling of 10% would
have led to a change in our EBITDA of approximately €34.2 million, compared to €27.1 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020.

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

We are subject to interest rate risks from financial assets and financial indebtedness, primarily in the Eurozone
and Russia. We calculate existing interest rate risks with sensitivity analyses that show the effects of changes in
market interest rates on interest payments, interest income and expenses as well as on equity. Should the sensitivity
analysis show that interest rate fluctuations could lead to significant impacts, we could use derivative hedging
instruments to avoid the risk.

A sensitivity analysis showed that an increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points in the year ended
December 31, 2021 would have resulted in additional loss of €11.3 million, compared to €6.3 million in the year

225


-----

ended December 31, 2020, and a decrease in market interest rates of 100 basis points would have resulted in
additional income of €0.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to €0.4 million in the year
ended December 31, 2020.

Following the Exchange Offers, our indebtedness and other debt arrangements will be primarily composed of the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities (which will bear a floating interest rate based on EURIBOR, LIBOR or SONIA,
plus, in respect of SONIA-based loans only, a variable credit adjustment spread), the Senior Notes, the Existing
Notes and the New Notes (each which have a fixed rate coupon).

**_Default Risks_**

We are exposed to default risk in our operating business or as a result of financing activities if contracting parties
fail to meet their obligations. To avoid default risks in financing activities, appropriate credit management
processes are in place and such transactions are generally only entered into with counterparties of sufficient credit
quality.

Risks of default also exist as a result of the supply of goods and services. We therefore strive to maintain business
relations only with counterparties of sufficient credit quality. In addition, we partly use credit support such as
guarantees, loan insurance or the transfer of assets to safeguard ourselves against default risk. Overdue receivables
are continuously monitored and potential default risks are addressed through value adjustments. In addition, there
is the risk that in a difficult economic and financial environment, national healthcare systems may delay or fail to
make payments to us or our business partners, directly or indirectly increasing the risks of default.

**_Transfer Price Risks_**

We have an international network of subsidiaries and carry out strategic functions centrally through STADA
Arzneimittel AG. As a result, an overarching tax transfer pricing model for the billing of intragroup services is of
increasing importance. Potential risks of the non-recognition of these transfer prices for tax purposes (for example,
from retroactive tax claims of the local tax authorities against one of our subsidiaries) are limited by the
introduction of corresponding agreement procedures and a comprehensive definition of transfer prices in our
Group wide policies. There can be no assurance, however, that transfer prices will be recognized by the competent
authorities.

**_Impairment Risks_**

The valuation rates of assets presented on our consolidated balance sheet are subject to changes in market and
business relationships and thereby to changes in fair value. Our annual and case-related impairment test may result
in significant charges against earnings and adverse impacts on balance sheet ratios. This particularly applies to
goodwill primarily resulting from purchase price allocations linked to previous acquisitions, and for other
intangible assets. All relevant risks are considered in the context of the preparation of the Financial Statements.

**_Tax Risks_**

Our business activity in the national markets is subject to the applicable national or international tax laws and
regulations. Changes to the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate as well as different law interpretations
can result in risks with impacts on tax expenses, tax revenues, tax receivables and tax liabilities. Our tax
department identifies, evaluates and systematically monitors tax risks and takes appropriate measures to reduce
tax risks. Furthermore, we take advantage of our international network and of our centralized strategic function,
which allow us, among the other things, to have an efficient tax transfer pricing model for the billing of the
Group’s internal services. Potential risks of non-recognition of these transfer prices for tax purposes (e.g., from
retroactive tax claims of the local tax authorities against a subsidiary of our Group) are limited by our internal
procedures and a comprehensive definition of transfer prices included in our Group’s guidelines.

**_Critical Accounting Policies_**

The presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations in the Financial Statements is
determined by recognition and valuation methods. To a certain extent, we make estimates and assumptions relating
to the future that are based on past experience as well as other factors that are considered to be appropriate in the
particular circumstances. Although the estimates and assumptions are constantly reevaluated, estimates derived
in this way may differ from actual circumstances. The significant estimates, accounting judgments and related
assumptions for the accounting issues concerned are detailed below.

226


-----

**_Purchase Price Allocations_**

As part of purchase price allocations in business combinations, goodwill is the difference between the acquired
net assets evaluated according to IFRS 3 and the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of the previously
held shares and the amount recognized of non-controlling interests. Various valuation methods used for purchase
price allocations are primarily based on estimates and assumptions.

**_Impairment_**

Goodwill is not amortized over the period of useful life. Instead, an impairment test is performed at least once a
year (impairment-only approach).

We carry out impairment tests for capitalized goodwill at least once a year. Additional reviews also take place if
indications of impairment become apparent. During the impairment test, the carrying amount of each cashgenerating unit is compared with its recoverable amount. The carrying amount of a cash-generating unit comprises
the carrying amounts of all assets and liabilities attributable to the valuation unit, including the carrying amount
of goodwill to be tested. If the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is lower than the carrying amount,
an impairment loss results. The recoverable amount is generally defined as the higher of the fair value less costs
to sell, if measurable, and the value in use of the cash-generating unit. The discounted cash flow method is used
to determine the value in use, applying an individual interest rate for each cash generating unit and a detailed
planning period of three years. Following this three-year period, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of
50% of the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. Significant assumptions are made in order to determine
the value in use, including assumptions regarding sales development, regulatory conditions, investments, the
discount rate and currency relations as well as the growth rate. These assumptions are made individually according
to the individual situations for every cash-generating unit and are partly based on internally determined
assumptions that both reflect past experience and include external market data.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. In the context of annual impairment tests and
additionally in all cases where there are indications of impairment, the recoverable amounts of these assets are
compared with their carrying amounts and, if necessary, an impairment loss is recognized. For this purpose, the
fair value of the asset less costs to sell was determined using the relief from royalty method. In our case, the
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives relate to the umbrella brands of STADA, Hemofarm, Pymepharco
and Vannier, all capitalized in the context of their respective acquisitions.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Sanctions imposed against Russia, Russian entities and Russian
individuals have introduced significant uncertainty about the country’s and affected individuals’
ability/willingness to honor their foreign currency debt obligations. This default risk in combination with
abnormally high foreign currency volatility on the capital market and Sanctions against Russia has caused Russia
to be excluded from the credit rating system. Our management is of the opinion that determining the country risk
premium by applying the relevant credit rating is no longer applicable for Russia and thus is no longer a viable
indicator of the risk for our investment in Russia into a local pharmaceutical company that is not affected by any
of the Sanctions. The traditional approach of IAS 36.A4-A6, where a single set of estimated cash flows is
discounted with a WACC determined by country risk premiums – which we followed until January 1, 2022 would
thus lead to an inappropriate representation and measurement of assets.

Instead, for the interim period from January 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022, management has applied the so-called
expected cash flow approach: rather than discounting a single cash flow projection with a risk-adjusted WACC,
management has taken the uncertainty and risks induced by conflict between the Russia and Ukraine into account
in the cash flow projection of the underlying Russian business operations in the form of several scenarios with
varying probabilities of occurrence. In developing the future cash flow scenarios for the Russian business,
management considered the following variables: the development of the foreign exchange rate of the Russian
ruble versus the euro and its translational and transactional effects; the Russian inflation rate and its effect on
COGS and OPEX; our ability to compensate for the inflationary tendencies by pricing activities; the change in
market demand and our market share as well as our Marketing & Sales activities as a result. Based on the varying
set of values in these variables, four scenarios have been developed and assigned with a probability of occurring
which was determined based on expert interviews and analysis of financial market indicators:

 - Scenario A (base case) with a probability of 55%: moderate ruble devaluation and inflation with singledigit market contraction;

227


-----

 - Scenario B (downside case) with a probability of 25%: significant ruble devaluation and inflation and
double-digit market contraction;

 - Scenario C (national bankruptcy case) with a probability of 15%: very significant ruble devaluation and
inflation and high double-digit demand contraction;

 - Scenario D (expropriation case) with a probability of 5%: worst case with a full discontinuation of the
business and cash flows in Russia.

Based on the four different cash-flow scenarios and their probability of occurrence, management has calculated a
probability-weighted cash flow which has then replaced the originally budgeted cash flows of the Russian
business. In turn, the Russian country-risk-premium has been eliminated from the discount-rate considerations
since the country risks have been reflected in the cash flows of the underlying operational business activities. The
aforementioned approach has been applied consistently for all relevant areas, performing goodwill impairment,
testing intangible and tangible assets associated with the Russian business of the Group. For the remaining
business, the approach was unchanged. This also includes Ukraine, as a credit rating is still available thus a country
risk premium can be determined.

If the reasons for an impairment no longer exist and as far as intangible assets with a determinable useful lifetime
are concerned, the corresponding write-ups are carried out up to a maximum of the carrying amounts determined
at amortized cost. Income from write-ups is reported under the heading “Other income.”

**_Development Costs_**

Development costs are capitalized based on the assessment of whether the capitalization requirements of IAS 38
are met. Planning calculations are necessary to determine the future economic benefit, which are by their nature
subject to estimates and may therefore deviate from actual circumstances in the future.

**_Valuation Allowances on Receivables_**

We make valuation allowances on receivables in order to anticipate losses expected in relation to the insolvency
of customers. The maturity structure of net receivables and past experience in relation to bad debts as well as
customers’ creditworthiness are used as the criteria for evaluating the appropriateness of valuation allowances.
This does not, however, exclude the possibility that the actual derecognitions will exceed the expected valuation
allowances due to a significant worsening in the financial position of the customer. Accounting judgments and
estimates regarding the assessment of the value of receivables relate particularly to impaired receivables from
debtors in Central and Eastern European countries.

**_Provisions for Pensions and Similar Obligations_**

We maintain defined benefit plans in various countries, according to which the amount of pension benefits
depends on the employee’s pensionable remuneration and length of service or which contain guarantees not
permitting recognition as defined contribution plans. Pension obligations are measured in accordance with
actuarial principles using the projected unit credit method. The pension provisions recognized in the balance sheet
correspond to the present value of the defined benefit obligation on the balance sheet date less the fair value of
plan assets, adjusted for any limitation of the benefit asset. In addition to earned pensions and entitlements, the
calculation also includes future salary and pension increases. For our German companies, pension obligations are
calculated based on the biometric accounting principles of the Heubeck 2018G mortality tables. In other countries
in which we operate, country specific mortality tables are used. Future pension benefits are subject to individual
pension agreements. The discount rate will be based on long-term rates of return on high quality corporate bonds
with fixed interest rates at the reporting date. In countries where there is no liquid market for corporate bonds, the
discount rate is determined on the basis of market yields on government bonds. Changes to the assumptions can
significantly influence the amount of future pension costs.

The standard IAS 19 only permits actuarial gains and losses to be recognized with no effect on income. It
differentiates between gains and losses due to changes in demographic assumptions and financial assumptions as
well as experience based amendments. They are recognized directly in equity with no effect on income in the
period in which they occur (“other comprehensive income” or “OCI”). The relevant amounts are reported
separately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. For the calculation of the portion of the interest
income on plan assets recognized through profit or loss, IAS 19 requires the application of the discount rate
underlying the obligation. The remainder of the actual income from plan assets is to be recognized directly in

228


-----

other comprehensive income with no effect on profit or loss. The current service cost is recognized in staff costs
of the individual functional areas. All past service costs that arise in the financial year shall be recognized
immediately through profit or loss.

Several of our subsidiaries also grant their employees defined contribution plans. In these cases, we pay defined
contributions to independent institutions due to legal or contractual requirements or on a voluntary basis without
incurring additional liabilities. Contributions to be paid for the respective plans are recognized as expenses in the
respective period in the relevant functional areas.

The other non-current provisions contain “anniversary provisions” and other long-term employee benefits.
Commitments to anniversary payments are accounted in accordance with the guidelines in IAS 19 and other longterm employee benefits. In contrast to pension provisions, actuarial gains and losses are not recognized without
an effect on the income statement. Such potential gains and losses are immediately reported as income or
expenditure in the relevant functional areas. Furthermore, there is a working time accounts plan and a preretirement benefits plan that are both accounted for in the same way as commitments to anniversary payments.

**_Other Provisions_**

We set aside other provisions in case current legal or constructive obligations to third parties arise from past events
that will likely lead to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits that can be reliably determined. An
outflow of assets embodying economic benefits is considered as probable if it is more likely to occur than not.
Other provisions are recognized in an amount that, taking into account all recognizable risks, offers the best
possible estimate of expenditures necessary to fulfill the obligations. Any existing reimbursement claims by third
parties are not netted with other provisions. Expenses from the creation of provisions are allocated to functional
costs according to where they arise. If changes in estimates result in a reduction of the obligation, the other
provisions are reversed on a pro rata basis and recognized through profit and loss under the item where the original
expense was recognized.

The creation of other provisions is based on the assessment of management regarding the probability and amount
of an outflow of resources. We set aside provisions in the event of a present external obligation and a probable
outflow of resources (meaning that an outflow is more likely to occur than not). Provisions in relation to pending
legal disputes are created based on how we estimate the prospects of the success of these methods. The
determination of provisions for damages is also associated with substantial estimates and can change due to new
information. The same applies for the recognition of the amount of contingent liabilities.

**_Provisions for Warranties and Discounts_**

Expenses from the creation of provisions for warranties are considered in sales and charged against income.
Estimated values based on past experience are used for this purpose. This means that the actual expenses for
warranties may differ from the estimate and sales would accordingly turn out to be higher or lower. The same
applies for the consideration of discounts (e.g., discounts to health insurance organizations) prescribed by law and
due to other regulatory requirements. These are recognized with a reduction on sales based on the respective
underlying contract with an estimated amount in expectation of probable sales.

**_Income Taxes_**

Income taxes include actual taxes on income as well as deferred tax liabilities. The tax receivables and liabilities
recognized in the balance sheet include demands or liabilities for income taxes in Germany and outside Germany
in respect of the year ended December 31, 2021, as well as from previous years, if applicable. The tax receivables
and liabilities are calculated on the basis of tax rates effective as of the reporting date or known and already
concluded for the future in the countries in which the taxable profit is generated.

Deferred tax liabilities are created for temporary differences between the tax base of the assets or liabilities and
their valuation rate in the IFRS Financial Statements. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is
probable that a taxable profit will result against which the temporary difference can be utilized as well as for tax
loss carryforwards. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences taxable in the future. We
determine deferred taxes on the basis of tax rates applicable at the reporting date or those that have already been
resolved and communicated for the future. Deferred tax receivables and liabilities are offset if these relate to the
same taxation authority.

229


-----

The tax expense in the period is recognized in the income statement, provided the changes in value that are
recognized directly in equity are not affected. To the extent that there are changes in the tax rate with an effect on
deferred taxes, the resulting effects are recognized in the period in which they arise.

We operate in various countries and are obligated to pay income taxes in each respective tax jurisdiction. In order
to calculate the income tax provisions and the deferred tax liabilities in the Group, the expected income taxes as
well as the temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain balance sheet items according
to IFRS are determined on the basis of assumptions. If the final taxation imposed deviates from the assumed
values, this has a corresponding effect on current and deferred taxes and thus on the net assets, financial position
and results of our operations in the respective periods. Furthermore, we consider increasingly important the
existence of a comprehensive tax transfer pricing model for the remuneration of intragroup services within the
Group. Possible risks of non-recognition of these transfer prices for tax purposes are limited by the introduction
of appropriate communication methods and an overarching definition of transfer pricing in the form of Group
wide policies.

**_Derivative Financial Instruments_**

We counter risks from fluctuations in cash flow with derivative financial instruments, which are exclusively used
to hedge interest and currency risks resulting from operating activities, financial transactions and investments.
Derivative financial instruments are neither held nor issued for speculation purposes.

Derivative financial instruments exist in the context of derivatives measured at fair value through profit or loss as
well as in the context of derivative hedging instruments. Cash flow hedges, fair value hedges and hedges of net
investments in a foreign operation can generally be recognized as derivative hedging instruments in the context
of hedge accounting.

We use cash flow hedges to protect against fluctuations of cash flows associated with an accounted asset or an
accounted financial liability or a highly probable planned transaction. Changes in the fair value of these hedging
instruments are recognized with no effect on income in the amount of the effective part of the hedging relationship
directly in equity. A transfer to the income statement takes place in the period when the underlying hedged item
becomes effective. The ineffective part of the changes in value is, however, recognized directly in the income
statement.

In the context of fair value hedges, the risk of a change in fair value of accounted assets or accounted liabilities or
fixed off balance liabilities is hedged. Changes in the fair value of these hedging transactions are recorded in our
income statement as if they were changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged items. If the requirements for
hedge accounting are no longer met, the carrying amounts of the previously hedged items are adjusted on the basis
of their remaining terms. Hedges of net investments in a foreign operation are treated according to the same
accounting policies as cash flow hedges.

As of the date of this Exchange Offer Memorandum, we have not yet made use of the option to designate financial
liabilities on initial recognition as financial liabilities to be recognized at fair value through profit or loss.

When determining the fair values of derivatives and other financial instruments for which no market price in an
active market is available, valuation models based on input parameters observable in the market are applied. The
cash flows, which are already fixed or calculated by means of the current yield curve using so called “forward
rates,” are discounted to the measurement date with the discount factors determined by means of the yield curve
valid on the reporting date.

As of June 30, 2022, we hold derivatives both with and without hedging relationship in the form of currency
swaps.

**Global Pharmaceutical Industry Overview**

The global pharmaceutical market is a growing industry with growth expected to be driven primarily by important
sector growth trends such as an aging population in the world’s developed economies, the launch of new and
enhanced treatment options for patients, and the increasing significance of emerging markets.

The United States is the largest pharmaceutical market globally, contributing approximately to 42% of total
pharmaceutical sales in 2021. Historically there has been a favorable pricing environment and a generally higher
utilization of pharmaceuticals in the United States, compared to other developed markets. Europe is the second
largest market with Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Italy (the “EU4” along with the UK)
contributing approximately 15% of total pharmaceutical sales and Japan is the third largest pharmaceutical market
contributing 6%. China and the rest of the world market make up the remaining 38% of pharmaceutical sales.

**Product Segments**

The pharmaceutical industry is comprised of a broad range of product segments including patent protected branded
prescription drugs, generic prescription drugs, OTC products and nutraceutical products. Patent protected branded
prescription drugs include both chemical pharmaceutical products and biologics. Generic prescription drugs
include simple generics, branded generics, specialty generics and biosimilars.

**_Patent Protected Branded Prescription Drugs_**

Patent protected Branded prescription drugs involve a significant commitment of time and money in research and
development (“R&D”) and depend upon patent protection laws to recuperate the significant initial investment and
to compensate for other drugs in the pipeline that were unsuccessful. They are sold under branded names and can
be either chemical pharmaceuticals, which are chemically synthesized small molecules, or biologics, which are
large complex molecules extracted from a variety of natural sources (human, animal or microorganism) and are
used to treat a range of diseases and medical conditions. Examples of biologics include vaccines, gene therapies
and cellular therapies.

**_Generic Prescription Drugs_**

Generic drugs are the chemical and therapeutic equivalents of reference branded prescription drugs, typically sold
under their generic chemical names at prices below those of their branded drug equivalent. These drugs can be
introduced into the market once patents and regulatory exclusivity have expired on a given branded prescription
drug, and are generally required to meet similar governmental standards as their branded name equivalent and
also must generally receive regulatory approval prior to their sale. Governments, in an effort to control rising
healthcare costs, are increasingly mandating the use of generic drugs instead of the more expensive branded
equivalents as they often provide similar benefits after passing through the approval process. Global medicine
volumes have increased from 2.5 trillion doses in 2006 to 4.0 trillion doses in the first half of 2022. According to
IQVIA, the generics market (including biosimilars and early-entry generic products) was $247.1 billion in 2022
and is expected to grow to $333.8 billion in 2025.

**_Simple Generics_**

Simple generic drugs are marketed and sold using only the generic chemical name (International Non-Proprietary
Name (‘‘INN’’)) and are not given a brand name.

231


-----

**_Branded Generics_**

Branded generic drugs are marketed under another company’s specific brand name which is different to the brand
name of the original product.

**_Specialty Generics_**

Specialty generics differ from original products in terms of their formulation or method of delivery. They
sometimes require a new drug application to obtain regulatory approvals. These drugs are enhanced in terms of
drug delivery, manufacture, or reformulation technology, and face a more stringent regulatory approval process
than generic prescription drugs. They may also be referred to as added value generics, new therapeutic entities, or
hybrids. Specialty generics take at least three to four years to be developed for registration.

**_Biosimilars_**

Biosimilars are an emerging class of biologic drugs. While generics are based on chemically synthesized small
molecules that are identical to their branded originator counterpart on an atomic scale, biologics are based on large
and complex molecules extracted from natural sources and are therefore very difficult to replicate. However,
manufacturers have been able to create molecules that are highly similar to approved original molecule biologics
and obtain regulatory approval. These molecules are offered at a more affordable price and are referred to as
biosimilars. Biosimilar drugs can be thought of as the generic versions of biologics and are generally required to
have no clinically meaningful differences to the original molecule biologics in order to obtain regulatory approval.

**_OTC Drugs_**

OTC or non-prescription medicine can be purchased by a consumer without the supervision of a health care
professional such as a physician and without a prescription. OTC drugs are tried and tested products which have
been in the market for many years and are not typically protected by patents but rely on brands to differentiate the
products. As there are very few truly global OTC brands, there is a prevalence of local market leaders. As a result,
local brands have the potential to be successful in niche markets. The global OTC market has a historical growth
rate of 4-5%, with a CAGR of 6% for 2021-2025:

**_Nutraceutical Products_**

Nutraceuticals are foods or food extracts that are used for medical benefits, and often come in the form of a dietary
supplement. The increasing trend for ‘‘natural’’ products can be seen across consumer segments, and is also taking
place in the pharmaceutical industry due to increased focus on general wellness and healthier lifestyles. Products
based on naturally sourced active ingredients can have the same pharmaceutical effectiveness as standard
pharmaceutical products, often with better safety profiles and more limited side effects.

232


-----

**_Industry Dynamics & Drivers_**

There are a number of fundamental characteristics and trends that have historically impacted, and which we
believe will continue to impact, the growth of the broader pharmaceutical industry over the mid to long-term.

**_Resilient, Non-cyclical Industry_**

The pharmaceutical market is resilient and largely non-cyclical. Spending on prescription and OTC drugs is nondiscretionary in nature and has historically increased throughout a variety of cyclical periods.

Demand within the pharmaceutical market is driven by widespread global demand for improved healthcare
standards, rising disease awareness and consistent investment in scientific innovation and subsequent introduction
of new products and treatment regimes.

**_Aging World Population_**

Older individuals have a wider variety and consistency of health care needs and generally consume a greater
proportion of healthcare spend and pharmaceutical products than younger people, particularly for the treatment of
chronic diseases. According to the United Nations, the median age in the world is projected to rise from
approximately 31 years in 2020 to approximately 36 years by 2050, with the median age in Europe projected to
rise from approximately 43 years in 2020 to approximately 47 years by 2050. Furthermore, the percentage of the
population aged 50 years and older is projected to increase by 680 basis points from 2020 to 2040.

**Aging population in Europe (% of population 50+ years-old)**

**_Innovation Addressing Previously Unmet Medical Needs and Enhanced Treatment Options for Existing_**
**_Patients_**

New medicines are expected to transform patient care in connection with a large number of diseases, including
respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, as well as oncology, immunology and central nervous system disorders,
requiring increasing amounts of R&D expenditures. According to the European Federation of Pharmaceutical
Industries and Associations, the pharmaceutical industry invested approximately €39 billion in R&D in Europe in
2020, compared to R&D expenditures of €18 billion in 2000, representing an increase of over two times over the
last 20 years.

**_Pharmaceutical Products Provide Cost-effective Healthcare Spend Alternatives_**

Compared to other healthcare measures such as hospitalization and surgery, pharmaceutical products contribute a
relatively small share to total healthcare spending and thus are a cost-effective measure for healthcare payors for
the management of diseases.

**_Pharmaceutical Cost-containment in Developed Markets_**

Increasingly prudent and stricter healthcare spending, especially in Europe, is resulting in the tightening of
reimbursement policies as well as reductions in health coverage and increasing pressure on the price
pharmaceutical companies can charge for their products. These have led to an increased focus on cost-effective
alternatives, including encouraging generics & biosimilars prescription, increasing prevalence of self-medication
and greater consumption of preventive medicine including OTC products.

233


-----

**_Lifestyle Changes_**

Health and wellbeing have been an increasing focus for general population driven by increased awareness,
accessibility to healthcare, information sharing and increased prevalence of stress. In the developed markets, this
has encouraged active treatment of rising incidence of chronic ailments such as diabetes, heart disease, high
cholesterol, high blood pressure and obesity due to consumption of unhealthy food and a more sedentary lifestyle.
Demand for pharmaceutical products designed to treat and prevent these conditions have increased. Additionally,
the greater emphasis on health and wellbeing is increasing in demand for preventive medicines, nutraceutical
products and vitamins. Notably, this trend is also becoming increasingly apparent in emerging markets.

Rising affluence in both developed and emerging markets and the expansion of health insurance coverage is also
expected to drive increased access and demand for both prescription pharmaceuticals and OTC products.

**_Increasing Role of Emerging Markets_**

According to IQVIA, emerging markets are expected to account for a large portion of overall growth in the
pharmaceutical industry in the coming years. For example, in the generics industry, Central Eastern European
countries such as the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Serbia are expected to grow at a
combined CAGR of 5.8% between 2022 and 2026. This is higher than the anticipated growth of developed
Western European countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Italy where the average
generics industry CAGR between 2022 and 2026 is expected to be 4.7% (source: IQVIA). Overall economic
activity in emerging markets is expected to grow in line with rising disposable incomes, rising life expectancy and
increased access to medical care. Compared to more mature markets, emerging markets tend to have a larger
proportion of branded generics products and have health care systems that promote higher levels of ‘‘out of
pocket’’ spending by the consumer.

**_COVID-19 Impact on Global Pharmaceutical Markets_**

COVID-19 pandemic has had disruptive impact across economies globally. Overall demand for pharmaceutical
products slowed in 2020 as countries went into quarantines and lockdowns – demand for some medicines,
particularly those for elective treatment, slowed down and some medicines, particularly COVID-19 vaccines,
experienced high demand. Nonetheless demand for pharmaceuticals products have largely recovered in 2021 as
COVID-19 evolve from pandemic to endemic, albeit the variability across countries relating various COVID-19
management restrictions and regulations. Despite the unprecedented dynamics, pharmaceutical market growth
will continue to be driven by long-term macro factors as highlighted above.

**Industry Structure**

The broader global pharmaceutical industry can be grouped into five categories, each addressing different market
segments as described below:

**_Integrated, Global Pharmaceutical Companies_**

These are typically global pharmaceutical companies that are involved in all aspects of the pharmaceutical value
chain from early stage compound discovery, research and development to the sale and marketing of the
pharmaceutical product. The high failure rates and costs associated with discovering and developing a compound
in the laboratory through to successful commercialization leads most global pharmaceutical companies to focus
their efforts on the development and commercialization of a limited number of blockbuster drugs in their portfolio
so as to achieve an acceptable level of profitability.

**_Specialty Pharmaceutical Companies_**

These are typically small to medium sized pharmaceutical companies focused either on specific geographies or
therapeutic areas. Geographic focused pharmaceutical companies focus primarily on the marketing and
distribution of drugs within selected regions where they have developed a strong sales force presence. These
companies often have broad product portfolios and strong national or regional distribution networks. Therefore,
geographic focused pharmaceutical companies tend to be less at risk from the failure of any single product or any
single market and, unlike global pharmaceutical companies, focus their efforts on small and medium value drugs.
Specialty drug focused therapeutic pharmaceutical companies instead focus on specific therapeutic areas across
the value chain. These companies typically seek to have a multi-national presence in their particular niche product
markets.

234


-----

**_Biotechnology Companies_**

Biotechnology companies focus on new drug discoveries based on biological processes and are generally engaged
in the early stages of the value chain. These companies rely on their technological expertise, and only the larger
companies have developed sales and marketing capabilities. Biotechnology companies often seek to bring their
products to market through partnerships and alliances with larger pharmaceutical companies which have
established sales and marketing functions. Biotechnology companies are growing in importance as they are
increasingly responsible for the discovery of new drugs.

**_Generic Pharmaceutical Companies_**

Generic pharmaceutical companies focus on the manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products which are no
longer patent protected. These companies do not typically engage in the research and development of new products
and seek to maintain profitability by focusing on low-cost and high volume production.

**_Consumer Healthcare Companies_**

Consumer healthcare and OTC companies focus on the manufacture and sale of products that meet health needs
but do not require prescriptions. Despite varying definitions of consumer healthcare, it is generally considered to
be made up of any consumer good in which health related claims can be made including: OTC medicines, personal
hygiene, oral care, food & beverage, nutritional products, women’s health, infant care products and nutraceuticals.
These markets are characterized by significantly lower levels of regulation and government involvement,
generally not being reimbursable under government backed healthcare schemes. The consumer healthcare market
and companies are very focused on brands, with a correlation between profitability and the contribution of leading
brands to companies’ portfolios both globally and locally. OTC drugs account for the largest portion of the
consumer healthcare market, followed closely by vitamins and dietary supplements.

**Regulation**

The global pharmaceutical industry is extensively regulated by a number of local and international regulatory
authorities such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicine Agency and other similar
regulatory authorities. Regulatory requirements and procedures can differ by individual pharmaceutical market,
but include provisions relating to the control of the pharmaceutical markets, manufacturing, research and clinical
development, marketing, labelling and packaging, storage, distribution, dispensing, advertising and promotion,
export and import, and sometimes pricing of pharmaceutical products.

**_European Union_**

The EU pharmaceutical industry regulations require that medicinal products, including generic versions of
previously approved products and new strengths, dosage forms and formulations of previously approved products,
must receive a marketing authorization before they can be placed on the market in the EU. There are three main
procedures for application for authorization to market pharmaceutical products in the EU member states: the
Centralized Procedure, the Mutual Recognition Procedure, and the Decentralized Procedure (each as described
herein). It is also possible to obtain a pure national authorization for products intended for commercialization in a
single EU member state only. For more information, see ‘‘Regulation.’’

**Pricing and Reimbursement**

Healthcare is a major focus of governments around the world, with health services consuming a significant
percentage of governments’ budgets. Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in part on the availability of
reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health programs, managed care
providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Pharmaceutical prices in developed nations are
predominantly determined by government controlled authorities.

**_Europe_**

The majority of European citizens obtain their healthcare benefits from state organized programs. Governments
in European nations exert significant control over the cost of care, either through price controls on prescription
drugs, or reimbursement policies for prescription drugs sold within the country. The following is an overview of
the systems in the EU4 countries and the UK.

235


-----

**_Germany_**

In 2009, it became compulsory for high income individuals who could opt out of statutory health insurance to
obtain private health insurance. In 2020, around 88% of the population was covered by statutory health insurance
with around 10.5% of the population covered by private health insurance. Statutory health insurance is provided
by statutory healthcare funds (Krankenkassen). Through these funds, citizens have equal access to healthcare
benefits from healthcare professionals who are licensed and provide healthcare services within the statutory
healthcare system. For the employed, membership in the statutory health insurance system is mandatory unless
their income rises above an annually determined threshold (currently A64,350 per year). Previously, Germany did
not apply any form of external price referencing with other countries, and was itself a reference country for many
EU member states. Under the Pharmaceuticals Market Reorganization Act, a revised reimbursement system
introduced in 2014 within the German statutory health insurance, drugs employing new active pharmaceutical
ingredients are allowed to set their prices for the first twelve months post launch. A cost benefit analysis is then
launched within three months of introduction by the Institute for Quality and Efficacy in Health Care. For all
drugs employing new active pharmaceutical ingredients, the manufacturer must prove the benefits over
comparable available products, failing which the drug will be added to the existing reference pricing list. At the
end of twelve months, the price of drugs that demonstrate additional benefits can be negotiated between drug
manufacturers and the German federal association of statutory health insurance funds.

**_United Kingdom_**

The UK’s National Health Service (the “UK NHS”) was established in 1948 to provide universal healthcare to all
residents. The UK NHS is financed partly by the government and partly from national insurance premiums, paid
at source by employers and employees. Around 11% of the population currently has some form of private medical
insurance. Reimbursements are subject to the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (“PPRS”), which is a
profit framework that allows drug manufacturers a defined return on capital and profit each year. The National
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (“NICE”) was established in 1999 to review the cost efficiencies of
medicines and discourage their use if their cost outweighed their benefit. NICE is an executive non-departmental
public body of the Department of Health in the United Kingdom.

In April 2017, the Health Services Medical Supplies (Costs) Act (“The Act”) was given Royal assent, effective
from April 2018. The Act is focused on controlling the cost of health service medicines and other medical suppliers
in the United Kingdom. Prices of branded medicines for the NHS are regulated through two schemes: PPRS,
which is voluntary, and Statutory Scheme. Branded medicine providers can choose to sign up to PPRS or if not,
they will automatically fall under the control of Statutory Scheme. However, unbranded generic medicines sold
by companies which had opted into the PPRS in relation to their branded medicines, fell outside the Statutory
Scheme. Hence pricing of their unbranded generic medicines was not subject to the control of the Statutory
Scheme and was instead driven by market competition. This had created a loophole allowing some companies to
significantly increase the price of unbranded generics or in some cases de brand the branded medicine and
significantly increase the price owing to lack of competition. The Act introduced a similar payment mechanism
on medicines under the Statutory Scheme as that under the PPRS. As a result, the government can now control
the prices of unbranded generic medicines. In addition, the Act clarifies the government’s power to require
companies to make payments to control the cost of health service medicines. The Act also includes the power to
create regulations requiring manufacturers, distributors and suppliers to the NHS to maintain records and, if
requested, disclose such records to the department of health through the issuance of an information notice, thereby
strengthening the basis on which the government can collect data on the sale and purchase of medicines from all
parts of the supply chain. In case of non-compliance, the government can charge organizations a maximum penalty
of £10,000 per day or a single payment of £100,000.

**_France_**

France has a social insurance system which provides near universal coverage for patients. The main scheme
(Régime General) currently provides coverage for close to 92% of the population, and is predominantly financed
through compulsory contributions made by employees and employers. Around 95% of the population has
additional contracts with one of the supplementary sickness funds (including mutuelles, which are not for profit
providers) which cover private medical insurance and out of pocket payments. In an effort to contain overall
healthcare costs, the government closely controls the supply of prescription drugs in its capacity as both regulator
and the industry’s largest customer.

236


-----

**_Spain_**

In Spain the government’s pricing and reimbursement policy has been focused on cost-containment measures as
it attempts to reduce its financial deficit, despite the fact that prices in Spain are among the lowest in the European
Union. Since 2000, the government has introduced various price cuts, reductions to wholesale and retail margins
and cuts to the list of reimbursable drugs. At a central level, the Spanish government has enacted four royal decreelaws since 2010 that have directly affected the pharmaceutical industry by means of price reduction of older
pharmaceutical products, mandatory rebates on drugs and medical devices, and limitations of the numbers of
products eligible for a reimbursement under the Spanish National Health Service.

**_Italy_**

In Italy the price setting of medicines reimbursed by the National Health Service (the “Italian NHS”) is regulated
at the central level by the Italian Medicines Agency (“AIFA”), the national regulatory authority. The Italian health
care system is mostly public and, therefore, the price of drugs is determined under strict Health Technology
Assessment processes. The prices of pharmaceuticals’ reimbursements by the Italian NHS is set through direct
negotiation between AIFA and the pharmaceutical companies. The Italian NHS is largely funded through national
and regional taxes, supplemented by co-payments from patients for pharmaceuticals and outpatient care. Public
sources make up approximately 4⁄5 of total health care spending, with private spending accounting for
approximately 1/5, mainly in the form of out of pocket expenses. In Italy, only small fraction of total health care
expenditure is funded by private health insurance.

**European Generics Market**

In 2021, the generic drugs market in Europe had €52.0 billion in net sales. The European generic drug market has
grown at 5% in the second half of 2021 and 6% in the first half of 2022, which are attributable to the normalization
of infectious disease incidences, as well as the decrease in doctor and hospital visits following the COVID-19
pandemic:

**Industry Dynamics**

**_Generics Penetration_**

The size of the generics market differs widely across the various EU member states driven by various factors
including market conditions for new medicines, pricing/reimbursement structures, prescribing/ dispensing
tradition and the prevalence of efforts to encourage generic use. In some member states such as the United
Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark, generics are promoted and seen as a tool to contain rising
pharmaceutical patent and trademark office costs and as such these member states have strong generics penetration
rates as follows (by value as of 2021): United Kingdom 49%, Germany 47%, The Netherlands 59% and Denmark
37%. In other markets such as Spain, Belgium and Italy, where the original pharmaceutical prices are relatively
low, brand-recognition is high and generics are not actively prescribed by doctors or promoted by healthcare
insurance companies, there is a much lower level of generics market penetration. Hence, the penetration rates are
as follows (by value): Spain 36%, Belgium 28% and Italy 36% (source: IQVIA).

There is an increasing policy shift in certain European countries to promote generic prescribing as part of overall
healthcare reforms and to reduce the overall level of pharmaceutical expenditure which will likely lead to an
increase in the level of generics penetration in European markets.

**_Generics, including biosimilars, are expected to drive pharmaceutical market going forward spending amidst_**
**_loss of exclusivity (LOF)._**

Top 5 European pharmaceutical markets is expected to grow by $60 billion from 2021 to 2031 with paradigm
shifts in the drivers of growth. Loss of exclusivity / genericisation is expected to be a key driver of European
pharmaceutical markets going forward. The pharmaceutical market is expected a face a large number of patent
expirations in coming years, offering generic pharmaceutical companies opportunities to capture and capitalize
this trend by offering equivalent but more economical solutions to consumers.

**_Cost-containment Measures_**

As noted above, many European countries are tightening reimbursement policies and increasing pressure on the
price pharmaceutical companies can charge for their products leading to an increased focus on cost-effective
alternatives such as generics, biosimilars and OTC drugs.

**Summary Overview of the Six Largest Geographic Markets for STADA**

**_Germany_**

The German generics market had sales of approximately €8.0 billion in 2021 and has one of the highest levels of
generic penetration of 53% in 2021 (by volume). Germany has adopted key price saving measures and a high
price discount for generics, by a combination of reference pricing rebates, mandatory substitution, reimbursement
shifts, and a well-established public tendering system which covers the majority of generic sales. The generics
market is relatively fragmented with the top-five players in Germany representing approximately 43% of the

overall generics market. The German generics market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.7% between 2022 and
2026 (source: IQVIA).

OTC products represent an important product category in Germany representing approximately 11% total German
market (gross sales) based on registered medicines . The OTC market in Germany had sales of approximately
€5.1 billion in 2021, based on data received from IQVIA. OTC products are not generally reimbursed by public
health insurances but are paid for directly by the customers who continue to be influenced by brand-recognition.
In Germany, OTC products are available in pharmacies, supermarkets and via online retailing. The OTC market
is highly fragmented with the top-ten companies representing approximately 39% of the market in 2021, based
on data received from IQVIA.

**_Russia_**

The Russian market had sales of approximately €16.8 billion for 2021 and has a relatively high level of generic
penetration of approximately 49% as of 2021 (by volume).

In Russia, the government funded segment covering hospitals and the Additional Medicines Supply Program (the
“DLO”), which represents approximately 6.5% of the market, purchasing is largely conducted by tenders with the
government looking for the lowest price, and there is a strong preference for local producers. The majority of the
market (approximately 56.9%) is driven by retail sales (largely via pharmacies) which is an out-of-pocket market
paid for directly by patients and consumers.

The Russian generics market is one of the most fragmented markets in Europe, with the top-five players by sales
controlling approximately 19.5% of the market in 2021.

The Russian OTC market is relatively fragmented with the top-five players in the Russian OTC market
representing approximately 20% of the market in 2021 (source: IQVIA).

**_Italy_**

The Italian generics market had sales of approximately €5.0 billion for 2021 and has one of the lowest levels of
generic penetration in Europe of approximately 43% as of 2021 (by volume) and an average level of pricing
discount as a result of a high level of brand awareness and use of branded generics.

In Italy, a mandatory price discount is applied to public providers of generic pharmaceuticals approved under
national registration procedures, with wholesalers of generic pharmaceuticals restricted to a regulated margin for
wholesalers of generic pharmaceuticals. Tenders are only used for procurement for public institutions such as
hospitals. Physicians are free to indicate a specific brand of pharmaceutical to avoid generic substitution if they
explicitly give reasons for the choice, but pharmacies are required to dispense a cheaper generic instead of a
branded drug if not ruled out by a physician and if available. Patients can also opt to co pay for a reimbursed
pharmaceutical if the price being charged for the branded product is above the reference price.

The Italian generics market is relatively fragmented with the top-five players by sales controlling approximately
37% of the market in 2021. Given the high level of brand awareness, the pharmacist and patient have the most
influence on the purchasing decision. The Italian generics market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.5% between
2022 and 2026 (source: IQVIA).

The Italian OTC market represented sales of approximately €1.5 billion in 2021. The Italian market is generally
flat in terms of volume growth while the limited growth in terms of value is substantially determined by price
increases. In addition, the market is concentrated in a limited number of players. Tenders are only used for
procurement for public institutions such as hospitals. Physicians prescribing an off patent drugs are required to
specify the active ingredient and in addition they can add the name of the brand or the INN. Pharmacists are
required to dispense the cheapest product according to the ‘‘Transparency List,’’ unless patients choose to co pay
in order to obtain a more expensive brand.

**_United Kingdom_**

The UK generics market had sales of approximately €6.7 billion in 2021 and has one of the highest levels of
generic penetration in Europe of approximately 60% in 2021 (by volume).

The PPRS does not apply to generic versions of a pharmaceutical, which relies on competitive pricing dynamics
and allows free pricing for generic pharmaceuticals as long as the price is below that of the patented original drug.

239


-----

Reimbursement is regulated at the retail level for Category M generics products (approximately 90% of generics
products) based on a calculation that incorporates the volume weighted average price charged by manufacturers.

The UK is a mature and highly genericized market with the highest overall level of price discounting in Europe
as a result of the concentrated buying power of the NHS, although there is a limited use of tenders in the UK
market outside of hospitals and government tenders on vaccines for national immunization schedules. Wholesalers
are the key decision makers in the purchasing decision as both physicians and pharmacists prescribe and order
only by the generic name.

The UK generics market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.9% between 2022 and 2026.

The majority of OTC products are non-reimbursable and there is a low level of regulation in the UK market,
particularly as the UK is a pioneer of switching established and well known prescription products to OTC. The
nature to self-medicate is extremely prevalent in the UK, with product choice heavily influenced by a high level
of in store promotion and direct to consumer advertising. Grocery retail stores, supermarkets and pharmacies
remain the major channels for the distribution of OTC products in the United Kingdom with online retailing
growing slowly.

**_Spain_**

The Spanish generics market had sales of approximately €4.0 billion for 2021 and has a relatively low level of
generic penetration of approximately 47% as of 2021 (by volume).

Prices and margins for prescription drugs are tightly regulated. Recent pricing reform implemented in Spain
expects all pharmaceutical prices (including both original drug and generics drugs) to equalize, with the
government unlikely to reimburse products that do not reduce the list prices compared to the generics. While price
is the most important factor in the Spanish generics market, pharmacists still have a relatively strong decision
making power as a result of the fragmented pharmacy landscape in the country.

Pharmaceutical margins on generics are tightly regulated for both pharmacies and wholesalers, although there is
a limited use of tenders in the Spanish market except for certain regions (e.g. Andalusia) with pharmaceutical
companies typically contracting centrally with the regional authorities.

The Spanish generics market is relatively fragmented with the top-five players by sales controlling approximately
43% of the market in 2021. The Spanish market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.1% between 2022 and 2026
(source: IQVIA).

In Spain, OTC products account for a relatively small proportion of the overall market compared to prescription
pharmaceuticals and generics, with total OTC revenues of approximately €615 million in 2021.

**_Belgium_**

The Belgian generics market had sales of approximately €795.2 million in 2021 and is expected to grow at a
CAGR of 3.5% between 2022 and 2026. The generic penetration in Belgium is relatively low at 41% as of 2021
(by volume).

The OTC market in Belgium represented sales of approximately €493.0 million in 2021.

###### BUSINESS

**Overview**

We are a leading healthcare and pharmaceuticals company focused on generics, consumer healthcare (“CHC”)
and specialty medicines with a successful track record spanning over 120 years. With more than 600 CMOs and
25,000 SKUs covering many therapeutic areas, we develop, manufacture and market a diversified product
portfolio that includes many category leaders. We distribute our products in approximately 120 countries and have
a direct presence in all major European markets, as well as in growth markets in the MENA region, Asia and
Australia.

We rank as the fourth-largest player by gross sales in Europe in the market for generics and OTC medicines,
according to IQVIA. Our market leading positions provide us with a competitive advantage, which is bolstered
by our scale, brands, reputation and the breadth and diversification of our product portfolio, as well as our local
market expertise and established distribution channels built on strong relationships with wholesalers and
pharmacies. We continually work to optimize and manage our costs, including through our cost-effective
manufacturing footprint comprising 20 production facilities across Europe and Asia. Building on our tried and
tested platform, we launched over 790 individual products in 2020 and over 980 in 2021. Our solid pipeline of
new products provides us with further opportunities as our markets grow. We have a strong track record of growth,
both organically and through focused acquisitions, and seek to grow our business and further improve our
profitability by internationalizing successful products. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, we generated
sales of €3,510.8 million and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of €912.4 million.

We have categorized our products into the following three divisions: Generics, Consumer Healthcare and
Specialty:

_Generics: Our Generics division comprises prescription drugs sold under an international non-proprietary name_
(“INN generics”). Generics offer a lower cost alternative to the substantially more expensive pharmaceutical
originator products. Most of the products in our Generics division require a prescription for purchase and are only
available from pharmacies and/or hospitals. The market for prescription products is generally characterized by
regulated pricing, with competition driven by the reliability of supply and cost competitiveness. Patent expirations
and loss of regulatory market exclusivity of originator drugs feed our product pipeline in the Generics division,
allowing us to leverage our distribution channels and local market knowledge to launch new generic products.
Our Generics portfolio is diversified, with the top ten products accounting for less than 18% of sales in our
Generics division for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. The top ten products by sales (and their respective
therapeutic areas) in our Generics division for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, were: Tilidine (pain &
relief), Atorvastatin (cardio), Amoxiclav (antibiotics), Pantoprazole (gastro), Omeprazole (gastro), Diclofenac
(pain & relief), Bisoprolol (cardio), Amlodipine (cardio), Ezetimibe (cardio) and Olmesartan (hypertension). The
largest countries by sales in our Generics division for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, were Germany,
Italy, Belgium, Spain, Serbia, Switzerland, France, Vietnam, Russia and the Netherlands. We generated sales of
€1,377.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA of €336.4 million in our Generics division in the twelve months ended
June 30, 2022.

_Consumer Healthcare: Our Consumer Healthcare division comprises non-prescription medicines with regulatory_
status, such as OTC medicines or medical devices, cosmeceuticals and cosmetics, vitamins, minerals and
supplements (“VMS”) and certain consumer products such as the household disinfectant Zoflora. We market our
Consumer Healthcare products with a focus on product features, awareness and trust in the product or brand as
well as through endorsement by healthcare professionals such as pharmacists and doctors. While we have many
strong and large brands with leading positions in their respective markets, our portfolio of Consumer Healthcare
products is very diversified, with the top ten CHC products accounting for less than 29% of sales in our Consumer
Healthcare division for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. The top ten selling brands (and their respective
therapeutic areas) in our Consumer Healthcare division for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, were:
Cardiomagnyl (cardio), Zoflora (disinfectants), Nizoral (derma), Aqualor (cough & cold), Snup (cough & cold),
Paracetamol (pain & relief), Vitaprost (women & men’s health), Grippostad (cough & cold), Levomecol (derma)
and Artra (pain & relief). The largest countries by sales in our Consumer Healthcare division for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2022 were Russia, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Italy. We generated sales
of €1,450.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA of €388.1 million in our Consumer Healthcare division in the twelve
months ended June 30, 2022.

241


-----

_Specialty: Our Specialty division comprises the following three product categories:_

- _Branded generics, which includes prescription generics sold under a brand name, as opposed to INN generics._

- _Specialty_ _generics as defined by IQVIA, which comprises prescription drugs for chronic, complex or rare_
diseases which also meet at least three of the following criteria: (i) high annual costs, (ii) initiated and
maintained by a specialist for drug therapy, (iii) special procedure required (refrigerated, frozen or prone to
other biohazards), (iv) reimbursement assistance required, (v) limited distribution and (vi) extensive
monitoring or comprehensive patient counseling required.

- _Biosimilars, which are biologic medicinal products that are equivalent to an existing originator product._
Unlike small-molecule drugs, biologics contain active substances from a biological source, such as living
cells or organisms are often produced using advanced technology. Examples of biologics include insulin,
growth hormones and monoclonal antibodies. Despite not having to be identical to the originator product,
biosimilars must nevertheless demonstrate bio-equivalence.

We are continually expanding our existing range of products in the Specialty division. The top ten Specialty
products accounted for approximately 59% of sales in the division in the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. Our
top ten Specialty brands with their corresponding generic names were Silapo (Epoetin Zeta biosimilar), Apo-go
(Apomorhine), which is marketed in several countries under brand names APO-go, MOVAPO and APOKYN,
Edarbi (branded generic of azilsartan medoxomil), Bortezomib STADA (subcutaneous, ready-to-use injection,
branded generic to Velcade), Movymia (biosimilar of Fosteo or Teriparatid), Xefocam (branded generic of
Lornoxicam), Ovayas (biosimilar of Avastin or Bevacizumab), Versatis, Vipidia (branded generic of alogliptin)
and Lecigon. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, our Specialty division generated sales of €682.9 million
and Adjusted EBITDA of €193.0 million.

**Our Strengths**

**_Attractive Market Fundamentals for our Product Categories and Geographies_**

Generics are the backbone of almost every healthcare system and play a vital role in providing people across the
world with affordable medicines. Generics also incentivize innovation through competition and operational
efficiencies they bring to healthcare systems. Growth fundamentals in generics are robust. According to our
calculations on the basis of IQVIA, originator products with average sales of €7 billion per annum will lose patent
protection between 2022 and 2026 in the largest European pharmaceutical markets Germany, France, Italy, the
UK and Spain. According to IQVIA, generic penetration rates, i.e. the share of generic medicines of the total
prescription drug market, in many markets such as Italy, Belgium, France and Switzerland, are still well below
60% and an increase in the percentage of older people in the total population is driving greater need for medication.
Moreover, the diversity of regulatory requirements and the complexity of the value chain provide natural barriers
to entry.

The global CHC market grew strongly by 7.3% in 2021 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.8% between
2021 and 2025, according to IQVIA. Increasing cost pressures on national healthcare systems in the markets in
which we operate are causing more consumers to opt for self-medication. As consumers in the CHC market are
paying out of their own pocket, they are more likely to opt for the local brands they are familiar with, which means
there is less pressure on manufacturers to compete on price than in other segments of the global healthcare market.
In this environment, leading originator pharmaceutical companies tend to focus on specialty products (particularly
in oncology) rather than retail and mass market products, as demonstrated by the divestment by Takeda to us, of
the Takeda CIS Assets. Within the CHC market, companies are narrowing in on their core portfolio areas while
divesting non-core assets. For example, in 2017, Sanofi and Boehringer Ingelheim divested their non-care animal
health and consumer health businesses. Emerging CHC category leaders focus on the internationalization of
leading global CHC brands such as Aspirin, Wicks or Advil, while divesting lesser known local CHC brands, as
part of their strategy. As a result, there is growth potential for a player like us, with our ability to activate
underleveraged and niche brands through locally agile and consumer insight driven strategies.

Specialty, including biosimilars, is an emerging field. According to IQVIA, biosimilars are expected to grow at a
CAGR of 15.6% between 2021 and 2031. We believe that the patent expiration of more than 100 biologics in the
next decade and constant innovation in delivery technologies make the area an exciting field for those companies
that master the complex development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercialization requirements.

242


-----

We believe that the attractive market environment, combined with our capabilities and agility in marketing and
selling, portfolio management and launch performance, product supply and a strong execution of our strategies is
our key strength.

**_Broad Generics Portfolio with Leading Market Positions across Europe, Attractive Portfolio of Strong Local_**
**_Brands in Consumer Healthcare and Scalable Platform for Commercialization of Specialty/Biosimilars_**

We have a strong foothold in generics, with a broad product range covering most off-patent drugs across EUmarkets as well as Serbia, Bosnia, the Western Balkans and several other non-EU countries including Vietnam.
We are the market leaders in generics in Serbia and Belgium and hold a top three market position in Germany and
Switzerland and a top four market position in Italy and Spain, according to IQVIA. In many of these countries,
there is still potential for continued market growth as the generic penetration is still very low. For example, as of
2021, generic penetration was 28% in Belgium, 36% in Italy and Spain, 47% in Germany and 48% in France,
according to IQVIA. With increasing pressure on healthcare budgets, generic penetration and therefore generic
markets are expected to continue to grow; for example, according to IQVIA, Italy and Spain are expected to grow
by a CAGR of 5.5% and 1.1%, respectively, from 2021 to 2025. We believe that we can capitalize on growth
upsides in many other countries by leveraging our pan-EU product registrations and our existing local
infrastructure to gain market share.

In Consumer Healthcare, we benefit from an attractive portfolio with many strong local brands and products across
a wide spectrum of therapeutic areas such as cardio, gastro, cough & cold, dermatology, pain & relief, sleep or
VMS across many countries. We have significantly expanded our geographic footprint within CHC over the past
years, with the successful integration of CHC products (including a strong portfolio of food supplements across
Central and eastern European Countries) acquired from GlaxoSmithKline, Walmark, Takeda and Sanofi. See “—
_Leading Marketing & Selling Capabilities combined with Excellence in Portfolio-Acceleration through Product_
_Launches, Business Development & Licensing and M&A” and “—Superior growth through portfolio acceleration_
_via Launches, BD&L and M&A” below. We now have strong local brands in most countries in which we are_
present, which benefit from strong brand familiarity among patients and customers. Many of these brands have a
leading position within their categories, such as Grippostad, Silomat, Kamistad and Cetebe in Germany; Nizoral
in the UK; Cardiomagnyl, Artra, Vitaprost and Aqualor in Russia; Lunestil, Serelys and Sikikom in Belgium;
Hirudoid in Belgium, Italy, the Nordics and Austria; Nizoral in several European countries or Biopron in Czech
Republic and Slovakia.

In Specialty, we have made a focused effort over the past years to strengthen our capabilities and accelerate our
pipeline:

- In 2019, we developed and commercialized an innovative, ready to use formulation of cancer-drug
Bortezomib, which does not need to be dissolved before processing, as required for Velcade, the JanssenCilag originator drug,and thus offers a better value proposition.

- In 2020, we acquired Lecigon through the acquisition of Lobsor, its Swedish owner. Lecigon is a novel
medicine for the treatment of advanced Parkinson, combining levodopa, carbidopa and entacapone, which is
infused via a lightweight pump. We are now in the process of launching Lecigon across Europe.

- In 2021, we entered a partnership with Swedish Calliditas Therapeutics AB for the registration and marketing
of a novel specialty pharmaceutical candidate for the treatment of the chronic autoimmune kidney disease
immunoglobulin A nephropathy (“IgAN”) in the EEA, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. This orphan
drug combines Calliditas’s drug development expertise with our pan-European Marketing & Sales expertise
in specialty medicines, in particular in nephrology. The European Commission has granted conditional
marketing authorization for Kinpeygo (budesonide) capsules for the treatment of primary immunoglobulin A
IgAN in adults at risk of rapid disease progression with a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of equal to or greater
than 1.5 g/gram. Kinpeygo is an orphan medicinal product and the first and only approved treatment for
IgAN, a rare, progressive autoimmune disease of the kidney with a high unmet need and with more than 50%
of patients potentially progressing to end-stage renal disease. Through a partnership with developer Calliditas
Therapeutics, Kinpeygo will be marketed in the EEA exclusively by STADA. The conditional marketing
authorization applies in all 27 European Union member states, as well as Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.
We intend to initiate launches in European markets in 2022.

- In the area of biosimilars, where the development risk is highest and manufacturing is more difficult due to
higher quality standards, we have chosen to source and co-develop products with external partners who have

243


-----

proven development and production capabilities. As such, we have a partnership in place with Xbrane
Biopharma AB, a Swedish biosimilar company, for the joint development of a ranibizumab biosimilar and
optional cooperation on further biosimilars. We have entered into an exclusive strategic partnership with
Alvotech, an international biopharmaceutical company for the commercialization of six biosimilars
throughout Europe. Adalimumab (Hukyndra), the first biosimilar developed as part of our partnership with
Alvotech, received marketing authorization approval in November 2021 and was launched in Germany,
France and Netherlands in June 2022. We currently have four biosimilars in the market: Silapo, an
erythropoietin biosimilar; Cegfila, a pegfilgrastim biosimilar; Movymia, a teriparatide biosimilar; and
Oyavas, a bevacizumab biosimilar.

**_High Differentiation Driving Resilience, Agility and Synergies_**

We are diversified in terms of geographies, products and therapeutic areas as well as sales channels, customers,
and suppliers, thus significantly limiting exposure to any single product, country, reimbursement system, customer
or supplier. In the year ended December 31, 2021, no single product accounted for more than 3% and no single
country for more than 16%, of our net sales.

In addition, our local presence in approximately 120 countries across different product categories and different
go-to-market characteristics makes us agile on a local level while leveraging synergies across divisions and
countries. For example, being successful in generics in Germany, the UK and the Nordics requires strong price
competitiveness, which is supported by our global operations and supply chain synergies, and ability to navigate
national tender bodies and processes. In contrast, generic sales in pharmacy-driven countries like France, Spain
and Italy require strong relationships with pharmacies, cost-effective manufacturing capabilities (with synergies
across divisions) and high product supply reliability and service levels. In many eastern European markets by
contrast, strong product branding and promotions with physicians are often most important, allowing us to
capitalize on synergies across divisions to successfully deploy our medical sales force and media strategies.
Moreover, our scale and local market expertise allow us to respond relatively quickly to new consumer trends,
leverage regulatory know-how and exploit economies of scale in production, packaging, procurement, distribution
and other logistics.

**_Leading Marketing & Selling Capabilities combined with Excellence in Portfolio-Acceleration through_**
**_Product Launches, Business Development & Licensing and M&A_**

Our key strengths include our ability to maximize profitable growth of our existing portfolio through our
commercialization capabilities, product launch engine and business development and licensing (“BD&L”) and
M&A capabilities.

_Commercialization Engine:_ In the course of our long operational history and local market presence, we have
established strong relationships with physicians, pharmacies, wholesalers and logistic providers. We adopt a strict
return-on-investment approach with regard to resource-allocation and marketing and selling investment decisions
and seek to ensure that the business case for significant expenditures in marketing and selling are justified ex ante
and monitored regularly.

_Product Launch Engine:_ We are highly familiar with regulatory requirements in our key markets and have
developed leading expertise in dealing with regulatory, reimbursement, tendering and distribution issues. The
regulatory requirements for generics, specialty and CHC products can be complex and vary across countries and
therefore, provide us a significant competitive advantage over any new market entrants or other players with less
experience. Our regulatory expertise together with our product development efforts enable us to continuously
bring new products onto the market. We launched over 790 individual products in 2020 and over 980 in 2021.

_BD&L and M&A Engine: We have also established a strong track record in BD&L and M&A, spanning all steps_
from identification of potential in-licensing and acquisition targets, to thorough due diligence, sophisticated
budgeting and forecasting, and crafting bespoke acquisition agreements with performance-based variable
components to successful launch and integration. In 2019, we acquired from GlaxoSmithKline five skincare
brands and a pediatric cough remedy in Europe, as well as selected markets in APAC and Latin America, and
expanded our footprint in Eastern Europe and Asia through our acquisitions of Biopharma’s pharmaceutical
prescription and consumer health business in Ukraine. In 2020, we acquired several well-known CHC brands and
prescription medicines from Takeda. With the acquisition of Walmark, a leading consumer health and food
supplement provider across Central Europe, we significantly expanded our CHC footprint in Czech Republic,
Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and the Baltic states. In the second half of 2020, we acquired a
portfolio of 15 well-established CHC brands from GlaxoSmithKline for several European countries. In addition,

244


-----

also in 2020, we made several smaller local acquisitions such as the Fern C Consumer Health Business in the
Philippines and the acquisition of the customer portfolio of Opti Pharm AG, a specialist in the trade and
distribution of pharmaceutical products to self-dispensing doctors in Switzerland. In 2021, we continued to
significantly strengthen our European CHC portfolio through the acquisition of 16 well-established local
consumer healthcare brands from Sanofi, predominantly in European countries including France, Germany, Italy,
Poland and Spain. We also entered into a distribution agreement with Sanofi under which we began distributing
and marketing a Sanofi portfolio of approximately 50 established CHC brands in 20 European countries. We
have instituted a rigorous process of establishing a business plan and tracking performance of our acquisitions and
believe that in aggregate, our acquisitions have outperformed the business plan. In addition to the acquisitions, we
have successfully completed several licensing agreements, including with Lobsor, Calliditas, Xbrane and
Alvotech. We have closed 34 licensing deals in the first half of 2022, comprising of 17 in Generics, 14 in
Consumer Healthcare and four in Specialty.

with 20 production sites in 12 countries and 54% of our production volume in 2021 being manufactured in lower
cost countries in Eastern Europe and Asia. This provides us with a relatively low cost and highly flexible
production base. Our manufacturing sites are regularly audited and certified by supervisory bodies. Fifteen of our
sites are required to comply with stringent EU standards and are EU certified plants. Plants without EU
certification operate based on strict adherence to the relevant country requirements for the production of either
medicines or food supplements. Moreover, local production helps provide a natural hedge for currency
fluctuations and regulatory restrictions, and at times is an advantage in the marketing of products in certain
countries. We continuously seek to improve and manage our costs in order to increase our margins and potential
for growth and stable cash flows, and we intend to further streamline and improve our manufacturing operations
by optimizing the utilization of each plant. Furthermore, we have implemented operating expense-saving
programs in order to drive continuous improvements through lean processes and culture, an Overall Equipment
Effectiveness uplift program for productivity growth and a Total Productive Maintenance program for
preventative maintenance.

_Procurement and Supply Chain: We have a flexible and efficient Procurement and Supply Chain organization in_
place, which is a pre-requisite to managing our complex product portfolio and the supply landscape of internal
and external manufacturing sites. Through an integrated end-to-end approach that balances supply security,
inventory levels and competitive Cost of Goods Sold (“COGS”), we seek to ensure reliable supply to our
customers without interruptions. External suppliers are managed like internal suppliers. To further strengthen our
internal process, we established a unit called External Supply Operations (“ESO”) in 2021, which is the single
point of contact in STADA for all matters relating to contract manufacturing organization (“CMO”), including
new in-licensing deals, launches, commercial product life cycle management and termination. ESO provides
technical and operational support to our BD&L, Supply Chain, Technology Transfer and Global Launch functions,
all of which help maintain our revenue pipeline and identify growth acceleration opportunities.

**_Highly Experienced Management Team Supported by Committed Sponsors and Engaged Workforce with_**
**_Strong Values-Based Culture_**

_STADA Management Board: We have a highly experienced management team led by Peter Goldschmidt, who_
has been our Chief Executive Officer since September 2018 and draws on over 31 years of experience in the
pharmaceutical industry. Having held various senior management positions in Europe, Asia and the United States
for the Novartis Group, Mr. Goldschmidt also served as the President of Sandoz USA and the Head of North
America at Sandoz, where he rapidly expanded the company’s generics and biosimilar business, generating
revenues of over $3 billion. He was also the global executive member for Central and Eastern Europe for Sandoz,
leading Sandoz to a top ranking market position in generics and rapidly growing its OTC business. Our leadership
team further includes: Boris Döbler, who was appointed Chief Financial Officer (ad-interim) of STADA on
August 18, 2022, after serving as STADA’s CFO Europe and Group Vice-President of Global Financial Planning
& Analysis., Miguel Pagan Fernandez who was appointed Chief Technical Officer of STADA on July 1, 2018,
having previously served as the Head of Global Technical Operations (Solids and Special Technologies) of
Novartis and Simone Berger, Chief Human Resource Officer who was appointed in January 2019 and who joined
the Executive Board in April 2021.

_Sponsors: We also draw from the market expertise, business relationships, knowledge and experience of our_
Sponsors, Bain Capital and Cinven. Both our Sponsors have strong healthcare expertise and an extensive and

245


-----

successful track record of investing in companies in the healthcare sector. For example, Bain Capital increased
sales by 49% within two years and significantly increased the workforce at Bio Products Laboratory, creating a
life sciences champion in the United Kingdom, while Cinven combined two large laboratory diagnostics
companies, Synlab (Germany) and Labco (France), at the end of 2015, to form Synlab Group (headquartered in
Germany), the European champion in laboratory diagnostics. In addition, Cinven in 2012 invested in Mercury
Pharma and Amdipharm, and merged the two businesses to create AMCo, a major player in the fragmented
generics market in the United Kingdom. Cinven’s strategy centered on continued buy and build, further
internationalization and applying best practice across both companies, and resulted in AMCo’s sale to
TSX/Nasdaq listed Concordia Healthcare Corp for £2.3 billion in 2015. Cinven has also acquired LGC, a global
leader in the life sciences sector. Both Sponsors also have a strong track record of driving cost savings and
improvements in margins, while at the same time growing their portfolio companies both organically and through
targeted acquisitions.

_Highly-Engaged Workforce and Values-Based Company Culture: Our strong leadership team and private equity_
ownership have helped over the past years to also attract and retain top talent at the operational level. We were
named a top employer in Germany by the Top Employers Institute in 2021 and 2022, highlighting our exemplary
work in personnel management. The Top Employers Institute recognizes companies for their strong human
resources internationally. The evaluation criteria for the award includes personnel management and corporate
culture, including workforce planning, talent acquisition, development programs, performance management and
benefits. Our leadership team has prioritized employee engagement and a strong values-based culture. We have
carried out an intensive workforce engagement process and revised and re-articulated our values: Integrity,
Entrepreneurship, Agility and “one STADA”, which has received an enthusiastic response. In our latest employee
feedback survey, which 82% of our employees participated and over 30,000 comments were received, we
achieved a rating of 8.2 out of 10. We believe that our values reflect our past heritage as well as future
opportunities and serve as basis for decision-making. We believe that our values provide us with a purpose and
vision and differentiate us from our peers.

**_Attractive Financial Profile with Strong Cash Flow Generation Reinforced by Successful Improvements in_**
**_Working Capital Management_**

We have been able to deliver strong financial results in terms of sales and EBITDA-growth and cash flow
generation. Our constant currency sales increased at a CAGR of 14% from December 31, 2019 to December 31,
2021. We had Adjusted Cash Conversion of 87% and 84% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021,
respectively. Our EBITDA margin increased from 19% in the year ended December 31, 2020, to 23% in the year
ended December 31, 2021. Our business has significant operating leverage and low ongoing liquidity
requirements. We have historically experienced only modest seasonal net working capital movements, and our
management has consistently maintained a high degree of discipline around capital expenditures. As a
manufacturer of generics, we typically incur limited development expenses and no material research expenses.

In the six months ended June 30, 2022, we have outperformed most of our key competitors in terms of growth in
net sales.

**Our Strategy**

Over the past five years, our leadership team in collaboration with the Sponsors has established a clear strategic
roadmap for us, which is set forth below.

**_Double Down on our Strengths with Commercial Agility and Enterprise Leadership_**

We believe that our broad generics portfolio, leading local CHC brands and scalable Specialty platform (including
biosimilars) in combination with our very strong territorial and customer coverage across Europe and other
countries are something that only few competitors can match and that allows us to continuously capitalize on the
attractive market fundamentals in our industry. In addition, we believe that our agile, flexible, and local market
focused approach differentiates us from our competitors and allows us to pursue financially attractive
commercialization opportunities across our business divisions.

We encourage local teams to be entrepreneurial, giving them autonomy to pursue meaningful business
opportunities that can drive growth. We also acknowledge the need for partnerships as an extension of our own
value chain to fully leverage our commercial capabilities. We seek to apply our standards of excellence to our
partners as well.

We intend to continue focusing geographically on Europe and our other key markets. In other countries, we intend
to seek attractive growth opportunities with flexible and highly commercial operating models (for example,
through partnership with strong local players). In terms of product categories, we will continue to focus on our
three divisions Generics, Consumer Healthcare and Specialty. Our broad Generics portfolio remains resilient and
stable driven by continued growth of generic penetration, the opportunity to grow market share in many countries
and the continuous flow of drugs going off-patent. In Consumer Healthcare, we aim to drive superior growth
through the entrepreneurial and agile activation and expansion of local brands, in contrast with our leading CHC
competitors who often focus on only few global brands and selected categories. In Specialty, we intend to continue
to foster our pipeline of value-added-medicines and biosimilars and ramp-up our commercial capabilities to
capitalize on our existing strong pipeline with over ten biosimilars launches scheduled for the next seven years.

**_Leading Marketing and Sales Capabilities_**

We will continue to focus on our strong Marketing & Sales infrastructure and capabilities, which remain a key
competitive advantage. This comprises not only typical selling and marketing activities and investments, but also
capabilities around trade terms and cost optimization, strategic pricing on CHC products, advanced tender
analytics for generics as well as continued improvements in the area of tools and digitization (e.g. Customer
Relationship Management tools and eCommerce). Through our Marketing & Sales infrastructure, we have built
a leading commercialization platform for the healthcare sector in Europe and certain other global markets, and
this geographic presence is continuously strengthened by acquiring, and successfully integrating strong regional
brands.

**_Portfolio Acceleration via Launches, BD&L and M&A_**

We collaborate internally across our organization to manage and execute new product launches and our current
pipeline of products extends through to 2028 and beyond. We intend to continue adding to this pipeline across
our three divisions. In Generics, particularly in small-molecules oral solids, we intend to leverage our strong
development and manufacturing capabilities to deliver “first in, last out” launches, i.e. entering the market as soon
as we are allowed and maintaining best-in-class cost of sales in order to remain in the market for a long period. In
other divisions, we maintain flexibility in whether to develop products externally or internally. We believe that
we are a partner of choice in Europe, which has helped us gain access to interesting products on attractive terms.
We intend to continue to complete BD&L deals at a high rate, as we have done over the last few years, with an
emphasis on our Specialty division.

Furthermore, we will continue to selectively build on our successful M&A track record, which includes the
successful completion and integration of several recent M&A deals, including: (i) skincare brands and a pediatric
cough remedy in Europe and selected other markets from GlaxoSmithKline in 2019; (ii) Biopharma’s
pharmaceutical prescription and consumer health business in Ukraine in 2019; (iii) the Fern C Consumer Health
products in the Philippines in 2020; (iv) the customer portfolio of Opti Pharm AG in Switzerland in 2020, (v)
multiple, highly recognizable Consumer Health brands and prescription medicines from Takeda; (vi) the leading
OTC and food supplement business of Walmark in Central and Eastern Europe in 2020; and (vii) our acquisition
of 16 well-established consumer healthcare brands from Sanofi across 13 countries in 2021. We continue to

247


-----

selectively explore acquisitions in the Generics, Consumer Healthcare and Specialty areas where we see a strategic
fit, accretive dynamics for our sales and EBITDA growth and significant value creation opportunities.

**_Benchmark Low-Cost Operating Model_**

We have relentlessly driven cost discipline over the past years and aim to operate at benchmark low-cost levels.
The strategic cost-saving initiatives spearheaded under our transformation program established at the end of 2017
have realized aggregate run rate cost savings of more than €187.0 million as of December 31, 2021. We continue
to implement various cost savings initiatives and are targeting additional cost savings of €24.8 million by
December 31, 2022. See “Forward Looking Statements” and “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other
_Information—Other Consolidated Financial and Pro Forma Data.”_

In terms of cost of sales, we have continued initiatives to improve direct product procurement by renegotiating
supply contracts with our fragmented supply base and to create operational improvements in manufacturing by
insourcing certain third-party manufactured products and increasing operational efficiency, while also improving
our supply chain setup and organization through hub, route and order size optimization.

Our general & administrative and support functions are highly capable and scalable with a focus on providing
insights, guidance and leverage to the commercial units in countries that drive growth, minimizing corporate
overhead and bureaucracy by using advanced systems, processes and tools. We plan to maintain cost savings by
not increasing staff in any of the non-volume related functions despite our ambitious planned growth in sales and
complexity.

**_Efficient and Reliable Supply Chain_**

We aim to deliver high-quality products efficiently and with high reliability, underpinned by a strong compliance
foundation. We believe that the supply system needs to be able to manage the complexity of a broad network of
internal and external sites and that a certain diversification of the production and sourcing network is required to
maintain supply in times of economic, environmental, or political crisis. We believe that the key elements of our
ongoing supply chain management, including a broad and flexible in-house manufacturing footprint, best-in-class
external supply management guided by an integrated business-planning approach, an efficient regulatory function
and a rigorous quality approach while ensuring long-term global competitiveness on COGS, will allow us to
efficiently and cost-effectively ensure consistent delivery of our products to our customers.

**_Growth Culture Resulting In Superior Financial Results and Deleveraging_**

We intend to further institutionalize our growth culture and build a world class and high-performing team to ensure
our strategy is sustainable in the long-run. In recent years, we have attracted experienced and well-renowned
industry leaders and have been building a pool of future potential leaders across all areas of the organization. We
will continue to invest in people development through various leadership-training programs, off-sites and the
further promotion of our intensive communication and feedback culture. Furthermore, we will continue to
incentivize out-performance based on our leading values of integrity, agility, entrepreneurship, and ONE STADA.
With a growth mindset, we aim to continuously adapt as an organization to a changing environment, embracing
emerging digital technologies while continuing to focus on our commitment to our broader society – such as our
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) agenda. We see our people as the foundation of our success and
ensure diversity and equal opportunity at all levels of the organization. We believe that with a strong culture,
growth mindset and values as core part of our strategy, we have a self-reinforcing mechanism for the future.

We believe that the execution of the above strategy will help us generate superior financial results with sales and
EBITDA growing at a faster rate than our competition. For our business, which benefits from significant operating
leverage and low ongoing liquidity requirements, we intend to maintain discipline in capital expenditures broadly
in line with historical capital expenditures. In terms of risk management, we benefit from natural hedges against
transaction currency fluctuations where our production facilities are located in the same country as the end
consumer, but we also intend to continue to implement our derivative exchange rate hedging policies.

248


-----

Based on the above, we believe that the successful execution of our strategies will allow us to further improve
cash flow generation and progressively de-lever the company. Notwithstanding our intention to de-lever and our
focus on organic growth, we also intend to selectively consider acquisition opportunities as and when they arise.

**Our History**

Our historical roots can be traced back to a pharmacist’s cooperative founded in 1895 in Dresden, Germany, when
a group of pharmacists started manufacturing pharmaceutical products under the name Standardarzneimittel
Deutscher Apotheker. Over the course of our over 120-year history, we have leveraged our sustainable approach
to business and a strategy geared for the long term to expand from a small pharmaceutical undertaking focused
on its domestic German market, into a leading player in the international healthcare and pharmaceutical markets:

 - In 1957, we transferred our headquarters to its current location in Bad Vilbel.

 - Shortly thereafter, in 1961, we started shifting our manufacturing activities from local production by our
member pharmacies to centralized production facilities in Bad Vilbel.

 - At the beginning of 1970, we converted our corporate form from a cooperative into a corporation to
facilitate capital formation for our future expansion.

 - In 1975, we expanded our product portfolio by venturing into the nascent generics market.

 - In 1986, we leveraged our access to capital and began our expansion into international markets, first
through the purchase of subsidiaries in our neighboring countries, Switzerland and Austria, and later
through acquisitions in Asia, including Hong Kong in 1992.

 - In 1996, we acquired ALIUD PHARMA GmbH in Germany, which allowed us to expand our generics
portfolio to a second, separate product line. In 1997, we branched out further into the Czech Republic and
France.

 - In October 1997, we consummated our initial public offering (“IPO”) and listed our shares for official
trading on the stock exchanges in Frankfurt and Düsseldorf. Within five years of our IPO, our shares were
included in the renowned MDAX segment of the Deutsche Boerse Group.

 - By 2005, we had accelerated our international expansion and acquired companies in Thailand, Ireland, the
Philippines, the United Kingdom, Russia, Portugal and Serbia. In addition, we purchased several portfolios
of branded products (now part our Consumer Healthcare portfolio), as well as the rights to individual
branded products.

 - In 2006, for the first time our sales exceeded the threshold of €1 billion.

 - In 2008, the introduction of Silapo, a pharmaceutical product used to treat anemia resulting from chronic
kidney failure and chemotherapy, marked our first commercialization of a biosimilar. In the following
years, we began in licensing biosimilars from highly specialized suppliers, in order to develop our
biosimilars portfolio in a cost effective way.

 - In 2013, we moved into the field of individualized drug therapy with the introduction of multiple DNA
tests, and thereby developed our diagnostic portfolio. Over the course of the year the offering was expanded
into a diverse range of self-tests. Furthermore, with the acquisition of the British OTC supplier Thornton
& Ross, we took another step in developing our increasingly important consumer healthcare portfolio.

 - In 2014, for the first time our sales exceeded the threshold of €2 billion.

 - In 2017, the Sponsors acquired a controlling interest in STADA with the aim of consolidating its market
leading positions, further expanding its business and increasing profitability.

 - In 2018 and 2020, the Sponsors further increased their controlling interest through the Delisting Offer and
several negotiated transactions, which ultimately brought their ownership to 100% of the outstanding
common shares in STADA.

**Our Products**

**_Overview_**

_Generics, Consumer Healthcare Products, and Specialty Products_

We are a leading healthcare and pharmaceuticals company focused on generics, consumer healthcare and specialty
medicines with a successful track record spanning over 120 years. We have categorized our products into the
following three so-called divisions: Generics, Consumer Healthcare and Specialty.

_Generics: Our Generics division comprises prescription drugs sold under an international non-proprietary name,_
so-called INN generics. Generics offer a lower-cost alternative to the substantially more expensive pharmaceutical
originator products. In general, cost competitiveness and high supply reliability are the key success factors in our
Generics division, though go-to-market characteristics (for example the importance of pricing compared to doctorprescriptions or pharmacy-recommendation) can vary significantly from country to country, favoring players like
us with strong local presence and capabilities. The constant stream of patent expirations of originator drugs and
our strong regulatory capabilities secure a strong and steady stream of future product launches.

_Consumer Healthcare: Our Consumer Healthcare division comprises non-prescription medicines with regulatory_
status as OTC medicine or medical devices, cosmeceuticals and cosmetics as well as VMS and certain consumer
products such as the household disinfectant Zoflora. OTC medicines, medical devices and cosmeceuticals with
pharmaceutical status can only be sold within pharmacies while VMS, cosmetic and household products can also
be sold outside the pharmacy channel through channels such as grocery stores or eCommerce platforms.

_Specialty: our Specialty division comprises the following three product categories:_

 - _Branded generics, include prescription generics sold under a brand name, as opposed to INN generics;_

 - _Specialty_ _Generics, as defined by IQVIA, includes prescription drugs for chronic, complex or rare diseases_
which also meet at least three of the following criteria: (i) high annual costs, (ii) initiated and maintained
by a specialist for drug therapy, (iii) special procedure required (refrigerated, frozen or prone to other
biohazards), (iv) reimbursement assistance required, (v) limited distribution and (vi) extensive monitoring
or comprehensive patient counseling required;

 - _Biosimilars include biologic medical products that are almost an identical copy of an existing originator_
product. Unlike small-molecule drugs, biologics contain active substances from a biological source, such
as living cells or organisms (human, animals and microorganisms such as bacteria or yeast. Biologics are
often produced using advanced technology. Examples of biologics include insulin, growth hormones and
monoclonal antibodies. Despite not having to be identical to the originator product, biosimilars must
nevertheless demonstrate bio-equivalence. As of December 31, 2021, we are marketing four biosimilars:
Silapo a erythropoietin biosimilar, CEGFILA, a pegfilgrastim biosimilar, MOVYMIA, a teriparatide
biosimilar, and OYAVAS, a bevacizumab biosimilar. We launched Adalimumab (Hukyndra) in Germany,
France and the Netherlands in June 2022 and have a further six biosimilars under development for potential
launch between 2023 and 2026.

_Diversification Across Products, Therapeutic Areas, Delivery Forms and Packaging and Geographies_

With more than 600 CMOs and 25,000 SKUs, our portfolio is very broad and highly diversified. This ensures that
we are not dependent on the success of any single product, with no single product accounting for more than 3%
of sales in the year ended December 31, 2021. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, the top ten products in
our Generics portfolio accounted for less than 18% of sales in our Generics division. The top ten Consumer
Healthcare products accounted for less than 29% sales in that division, while the top ten Specialty products
accounted for 58% of our Specialty division’s sales in the twelve months ended June 30, 2022.

Our product offering is also well-diversified across therapeutic areas, covering, for example, cardiovascular
diseases; gastrointestinal conditions; cough and cold and respiratory illness; skin health; muscle and joint
conditions; oncology; histamine intolerance; lactose intolerance; stress relief and sleep disorders; menstrual
dysfunction and menopause; pain and fever relief; and pregnancy and lactation. Furthermore, our product portfolio
comprises a broad range of dosage forms such as tablets, capsules, suppositories, and dry powder for reconstitution
as suspensions and liquids. We offer a large spectrum of packaging sizes and various delivery forms, utilizing
either immediate- or sustained- release delivery. Our SKUs are marketed in approximately 120 largely
uncorrelated markets in Europe, the MENA region, Asia and Australia.

**_Our Generics Portfolio_**

Our Generics division accounted for €1,377.4 million, or 39%, of our sales in the twelve months ended June 30,
2022. The portfolio consists of a vast number of products of unbranded generics covering many therapeutic areas.
Most products are solid, small molecule INN generics that are administered orally.

The table below shows the top ten products in our Generics division by sales in the twelve months ended June 30,
2022, including their respective market share and market position in selected markets in major geographic regions
for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022. As can be seen in the table, therapeutic areas even among the top ten
products are very diverse and no product accounts for more than 3% of the division’s total sales, supporting the
continual strong resilience of our Generics division.

In addition to the four biosimilars we currently market and the planned Adalinumab launch in June 2022, we have
licensed additional biosimilars that are currently in the development phase. As part of these efforts, we have a
collaboration in place with Xbrane Biopharma AB, a Swedish biosimilar company, for the joint development of
a ranibizumab biosimilar, for which the regulatory application was submitted in the EU in the third quarter of
2021. The regulatory application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is planned for 2022. The
cooperation with Xbrane also includes an option for further biosimilars. We also have an exclusive strategic
partnership with Alvotech, an international biopharmaceutical company, for the marketing of six biosimilars
throughout Europe. This initially includes biosimilar candidates for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, cancer
and inflammatory diseases as well as in the area of ophthalmology for patients throughout the world. Adalimumab
(Hukyndra), the first biosimilar developed as part of our partnership with Alvotech received marketing
authorization approval in November 2021 and was launched in Germany, France and Netherlands in June 2022.

Furthermore, we have entered into a license agreement with Calliditas Therapeutics AB for the registration and
marketing of a novel specialty pharmaceutical candidate for the treatment of IgAN in the Member States of the
EEA, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Assuming we receive a final approval, we could potentially make the
product available to patients in Germany, the first launch market, in the second half of 2022 and other countries
in 2023, subject to market access and pricing discussions with relevant national authorities. If approved, this would
be the first therapy developed and approved specifically for the treatment of IgAN. Further, a confirmed orphan
disease status will provide us with 10 years of market exclusivity from the date of marketing authorization in the
EU.

**_Trends in Sales Mix Between Divisions_**

In the year ended December 31, 2021, the sales contribution from our Generics division was 41%, compared to
43% in the year ended December 31, 2020, while the sales contribution from our Specialty division was 19% in
the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 20% in the year ended December 31, 2020. The sales contribution
from our Consumer Healthcare division has increased from 37% of total sales in the year ended December 31,
2020 to 40% of total sales in the year ended December 31, 2021. The sales contribution of our Consumer
Healthcare division to our sales mix is mainly the result of organic growth, as well as our targeted efforts to
increase sales in our Consumer Healthcare division through acquisitions. Our acquisition of Thornton & Ross in
the United Kingdom, for example, provided us with a leading platform to sell our Consumer Healthcare products
in this market. We intend to continue to focus our growth efforts on Consumer Healthcare products, as they face
significantly fewer regulatory requirements than Generics.

253


-----

We believe the combination of our Generics, Consumer Healthcare, and Specialty divisions provides significant
benefits in terms of synergies. Our presence in all three areas allows us to deepen our local market expertise and
regulatory know-how, achieve economies of scale in production, packaging and marketing, and intensify our long
standing relationships with our distribution channels.

**Our Customers**

We sell our products to a diverse customer base that includes consumers, doctors, pharmacies, hospitals, mail
order companies, buying groups, wholesalers and other service providers in the healthcare market, as well as
public or private health insurance organizations. The importance of these customer groups varies by country.
Germany has a well-established tender scheme in place, such that the key purchase decision is made by the public
health insurance system. In our Belgian business, which mostly focuses on Generics, the most important customer
group is the doctors writing prescriptions. In Italy and Spain, pharmacies have significant discretion to decide
which medication is dispensed, such that they are considered the key decision makers. In Russia, where our
product portfolio is heavily weighted toward Consumer Healthcare, our key customers are consumers in the selfpay market. Germany’s public tendering system covers the majority of generics sales, in which we have operated
successfully. In Italy, the United Kingdom and Vietnam, tenders are used for procurement by public institutions
such as hospitals. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our largest customer accounted for €422.1 million, or
13%, of our sales, compared with €418.2 million or 14%, of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2020. In
the year ended December 31, 2021, no other single customer accounted for more than 10% of our sales, compared
with no more than 10% in the year ended December 31, 2020.

**Our Suppliers**

We believe that we do not materially depend on any single supplier. We seek to source our active pharmaceutical
ingredients locally in each of our markets. Most of our supply contracts include mechanisms aimed at reducing
our financial exposure, such as price escalation clauses (which link procurement prices to current selling prices)
and specific procurement prices for specific sales volumes.

**Procurement, Production and Quality Management**

We generally have significant flexibility in our supply chain management and plan our pharmaceuticals
production with a view to continuous cost improvement. As a result of our large product portfolio, which includes
approximately 800 active pharmaceutical ingredients and more than 600 CMOs and 25,000 SKUs to
accommodate various dosage forms and package sizes, we rely on a large, international network of internal and
external resources for our supply chain and pharmaceuticals production.

As a result, we have been able to outsource the production of raw and auxiliary materials involved in the
production of our pharmaceuticals to offshore suppliers based in Asia and other markets, which we believe deliver
good quality at competitive prices. In order to efficiently manage our procurement of raw materials from these
suppliers, we maintain specialized procurement offices in Shanghai (China) and Mumbai (India).

As a manufacturer, we are subject to fluctuations in the market prices of our raw and auxiliary materials.
Additionally, our costs depend significantly on the prices we are able to negotiate with our contract manufacturers.
Under our manufacturing contracts, suppliers typically bear a portion of the loss if our gross margin decreases as
a result of lower sales prices. In other cases, we rely on renegotiations or agree specific procurement prices for
specific sales volumes, for example, volumes that are put out to tender by public health insurance organizations
in the context of discount agreements (Rabattverträge). Discount agreements are entered into between
pharmaceutical companies and insurance carriers including national social insurance schemes. In a discount
agreement the pharmaceutical company agrees to supply certain pharmaceuticals to the insurance carrier or its
customers at a significant discount in exchange for exclusivity in the relevant product category. Discount
agreements typically have a term of one or two years.

In recent years, we have gradually increased the share of in-house production, shifting production volumes from
our contract manufacturers to our own production facilities. Furthermore, in 2021, we manufactured 55% of our
production volume in lower-cost countries in Eastern Europe, Asia and South America. This provides us with a
relatively low cost and highly flexible production base. The expansion of cost effective in-house production,
coupled with the flexible make-or-buy approach described below, has helped us realize both structural cost
advantages and higher capacity utilization, which resulted in lower unit prices.

We take a flexible approach to our make-or-buy decisions. This means that we regularly compare our in-house
production costs to offers we receive from third-party manufacturers and are prepared to outsource production

254


-----

where this would result in sustainable cost savings. In the past, our decision to gradually insource production
capacity has helped us realize higher capacity utilization. Additionally, the fact that a significant number of our
manufacturing facilities are located in lower cost countries has provided us with structural cost advantages
compared to some of our competitors. Together, these factors have contributed significantly to the decrease in
unit costs that we have realized in recent years.

Each year, we invest in our production facilities and test laboratories in an effort to ensure they comply with the
applicable regulations and technical norms. In the year ended December 31, 2021, our investments in the
expansion and modernization of our production sites and facilities, as well as test laboratories, amounted to €65.7
million.

**_Highest Quality and Safety Standards_**

Our global quality and safety control management is located centrally through our top operating company,
STADA Arzneimittel AG. As an international healthcare company, we have established high standards for the
quality of our raw materials, products, services and working conditions. The quality standards we adhere to, both
in our own manufacturing sites and those of external suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in full compliance
or even exceed applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Our compliance with both the statutory requirements
and our internal standards is reviewed comprehensively each year as part of regular audits by our global quality
management teams.

In addition, the competent national authorities of each country where we operate carry out inspections of our
production facilities, on a recurring basis. Within the European Union, such inspections typically take place every
two or three years. Outside the European Union, we often go beyond national requirements and inspections and
additionally apply for EU Good Manufacturing Practice compliance inspections (also known as EU GMP
compliance inspections). In the course of these inspections, the responsible authorities audit the compliance of
our relevant non-EU production facilities with the relevant EU GMPs. Each positive inspection report results in a
three-year extension of our existing EU import licenses for products manufactured in these facilities. As a result,
nine of our 14 non-EU production facilities are approved for the production and export of certain pharmaceutical
dosage forms into EU countries (Huddersfield, Banja Luka, Nizhny Novgorod, Obninsk, Podgorica, Sabac, Tuy
Hòa and Vrsac Packaging Center).

In addition to our compliance with the applicable legal requirements, we hold international certifications in
accordance with external quality management systems. Accordingly, at numerous production sites, we focus not
only on GMP standards but also on the relevant requirements of the International Organization for
Standardization.

**Property, Plant and Equipment**

**_Manufacturing Facilities_**

We have a cost effective manufacturing footprint that is well-diversified across 20 manufacturing sites as of
December 31, 2021.

________________________________________

255


-----

- Our manufacturing sites are regularly audited and certified by supervisory bodies, and even some of our non-European manufacturing
facilities adhere to EU manufacturing standards (EU Good Manufacturing Practice), making them eligible to import to the EU. As a
result, we have a strong performance and compliance track record. Moreover, local production provides a natural hedge for currency
fluctuations and regulatory restrictions, and at times is an advantage in the marketing of products in certain countries. We continuously
seek to improve and manage our costs in order to increase our margins and potential for growth and stable cash flows, and we intend
to improve certain aspects of our manufacturing operations to achieve our ongoing cost savings initiatives.

**Sales and Marketing**

The sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products such as branded and unbranded generics is regulated in most
countries. Because such regulatory regimes are highly fragmented, competitors trying to enter a new market have
to navigate a variety of complex regulatory requirements, tender and reimbursement regimes, and distribution
channels. This provides a competitive advantage to existing players with scale and local expertise, such as us.

Building on our extensive local market expertise, we have decided to put in place decentralized marketing teams,
and the size and organization of our sales force is tailored to the local environment in each market. In Germany,
for example, we do not have a dedicated sales force, as the majority of our business is won through tenders. As a
result, our German marketing team is distinguished mostly by its sophisticated tender management. In Belgium,
our sales force targets primarily doctors who are the key decision makers in the market, whereas our sales teams
in Italy and Spain target pharmacies. In Russia, we market directly to consumers in the self-pay market. As part
of our centralized supervision structure, our marketing teams research each market extensively and carefully select
the products we decide to offer as part of our country portfolio, as well as the positioning of the products in their
respective market. Our marketing campaigns in the United Kingdom, for example, emphasize the filters contained
in our Ladival sunscreen products, whereas the marketing of Ladival in Spain focuses on the cosmetic benefits of
its ingredients. We believe the combination of centralized supervision and physical proximity to our customers
provides us with a powerful sales and marketing structure.

We have a direct sales presence in more than 35 countries, where we sell our products through our own marketing
teams, subsidiaries and branches, which allows us to stay close to our customers and distributors. This includes
all major European markets such as Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Spain. In addition, we
maintain a direct sales presence in growth markets in the MENA region (in the United Arab Emirates), Asia
(including Russia, Kazakhstan, China, Vietnam and the Philippines) and Australia. Our decision to establish a
direct sales presence is also driven by our local market expertise and is a function of the product portfolio we are
offering in a given market. In geographic regions where we do not have a direct presence or where our sales
presence does not cover our full product portfolio, we partner with recognized local companies. In China and
Vietnam, for example, we also market and distribute certain of our products through distribution agreements with
local partners. Including exports, our products were marketed and sold in approximately 120 countries in the year
ended December 31, 2021.

**Material Contracts**

Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this Exchange Offer Memorandum, we have not entered into any contracts
outside the ordinary course of our business that we consider material.

**Research and Product Development**

**_Research and Product Development_**

Based on our expertise and in order to minimize financial risks, we have decided not to conduct primary research
activities such as clinical trials. Our R&D activities focus primarily on product development, which is primarily
conducted through in-house development led by our own development sites for oral solid generics and selective
consumer healthcare dosage forms, while, it is primarily through partnerships with other companies that have
greater R&D expertise (enabling higher chances of success at lower cost), for areas like complex APIs, dosage
forms and specialty products. As a result, we do not incur material operating expenses for genuine product
research.

In terms of product development, we have established a global network of development sites across Europe with
a highly skilled workforce in Serbia, Germany, Czech Republic, Russia, the UK and Austria. Our expertise in
internal development lies in small molecule development, led by our center of excellence in Vrsac, Serbia. For
consumer healthcare innovation with liquids/disinfectants, our UK site in Huddersfield acts as the global center
of excellence. On specialty and complex technologies, we have established a strong network of co-development
partnerships that enables us to minimize upfront investment into in-house capacities with high financial risk
profile. Independent of the operating model (internal or co-development), our development activities are steered

256


-----

by commercial agility, a focus on the customer needs, quality, time-to-market and cost competitiveness with a
strong return on investment.

**_Regulatory, Medical and Pharmacovigilance Affairs (RAMACA)_**

As the marketing of our products normally requires the prior grant of a marketing authorization issued by the
competent regulators, we incur operating expenses that are classified under R&D also in connection with the
regulatory approval and maintenance process. Given our global product marketing, we are required to navigate
many different approval processes. We generally seek to realize synergies and obtain marketing authorizations
through supranational processes, which require only a single dossier and cover many countries, particularly in the
European Union. Approval procedures outside of the European Union are carried out, where possible, on the basis
of the EU dossier relating to the same product. In addition to regulatory fees and the cost of our employees working
in R&D, our R&D Operating Expenses also comprise costs in connection with Medical Affairs and
Pharmacovigilance.

**_Product Launches_**

Building on our tried and tested platform, we launched over 790 individual products in 2020 and over 980 in 2021.
The large majority of our new products are in our Generics division, whereas new product launches in the
Consumer Healthcare and Specialty divisions comprise smaller shares. We believe the number of our product
launches is high compared to most of our competitors, which is evidence of our strong capabilities in the
development process and our local market expertise. Our strong performance was also supported by continued
investment in development costs. New product launches contributed approximately 2% (€59.4 million) to our
sales for the year ended December 31, 2021, in addition to launches made in the year ended December 31, 2020,
which further contributed approximately 2% (€66.9 million). The chart below shows our product launches in each
of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, as well as our research and development costs in the
corresponding periods:

Due to the lengthy regulatory approval process typical of the pharmaceutical industry, we consider our
development pipeline an important indicator of our future sales. As of December 31, 2021, we were pursuing
more than 1,900 approval procedures for over 160 active pharmaceutical ingredients and combinations in more
than 55 countries. These include all relevant generics as well as numerous consumer healthcare products and
specialty pharmaceuticals. In particular, we have a large product pipeline in small molecule generics as we aim to
be a one-stop shop and provide the full range of drugs that go off patent. Most of our pending applications relate
to approvals for generics within the European Union.

**_Intellectual Property_**

_Trademarks_

In each market where material sales of any of our major Consumer Healthcare and Specialty products are made,
we register a trademark. In addition, we continuously register trademarks in respect of new products and renew
the trademarks that are about to expire. Our principal trademarks include APO go, Aqualor, Grippostad, Snup,
Vitaprost, Fultium, Ladival, Care, Covonia, Levomecol, Hirudoid, Zoflora and Hedrin.

257


-----

_Patents_

As a manufacturer of generic pharmaceuticals, we are not materially dependent on patents. Our key patents include
a solid pharmaceutical composition comprising Tilidine hydrochloride.

**Employees**

**_Long-term Personnel Policy_**

Through their extensive expertise and strong commitment, our employees make a substantial contribution to our
continuing success. As a result, our personnel policy focuses on long-term retention and is designed to support
the development of all of our employees. In terms of training, we offer language skills support, specialist
workshops, seminars and extra occupational study programs. In addition, we offer development and support
programs tailored to various career stages, and individual career planning. Examples of this include exchange
programs between German and foreign subsidiaries, as well as management programs. All personal development
measures aim to continuously provide the skills needed both now and in the future, and to fill management and
expert positions from within our own ranks as much as possible.

**_Development of the Number of Employees_**

Our average number of employees increased by 2% to 12,514 in the year ended December 31, 2021 from 12,311
in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to a volume-driven expansion in the
production area and execution of Specialty launches (such as Lecigon). There was also a slight increase due to
restructuring measures in Marketing & Sales in Russia/CIS and Eastern Europe. In the year ended December 31,
2021, the average number of employees in Germany increased by 6% to 1,343. The proportion of women
employed in management positions in the year ended December 31, 2021 remained at 52%, the same as in the
year ended December 31, 2020.

We believe that we have healthy relationships with our workforce and have not had any material labor disruptions
in recent years.

**_Pensions_**

We operate a number of pension schemes, including defined benefit schemes in certain countries in which we
operate, such as Germany and the United Kingdom.

**Insurance**

As part of our insurance program, we maintain general and product liability insurance, environmental liability
insurance, all risk property and business interruption insurance, cargo and transport insurance, industrial legal aid
insurance, fidelity insurance, electronic insurance and credit insurance, as well as health and accident insurance
covering most subsidiaries and operations to the extent we consider appropriate or otherwise as required by
applicable law. We are not currently involved in any material claims under our insurance.

**Information Technology**

Our critical information technology systems are largely operated and hosted by Fujitsu TDS. Our core systems
are centralized in data centers located in Germany where all SAP servers and SAP related infrastructure for
information technology systems located in Western Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States are
hosted. Other non-core information technology systems are operated locally by our subsidiaries.

**Environmental, Social and Governance Responsibility (ESG)**

Sustainability is a high priority for us. Our commitment to sustainable and responsible corporate governance is
demonstrated, among other things, by our membership in the UN Global Compact. In addition, we have a
“Sustainability Policy” as well as a Sustainalytics ESG risk rating in the “Medium Risk” category. We will publish
our first global Group-wide Sustainability Report in the third quarter of 2022 illustrating our strong commitment
to fulfilling the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 3 and other relevant United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals.

We always align our actions with the four corporate values of Agility, Entrepreneurship, Integrity and ONE
STADA in order to fulfill our purpose of “Caring for People's Health as a Trusted Partner.” We respect and value

258


-----

our personnel, investors, partners and those who use our products, the communities in which we work and the
natural environment. As sustainable action is one of the essential benchmarks for all our activities, we have clearly
defined goals and established processes to ensure, among other things, compliance with legal requirements.

By providing access to affordable medical care with our generics and specialty pharmaceuticals portfolio, we
reduce the cost pressure on healthcare systems, and our consumer healthcare portfolio provides access to
preventive health care.

**Joint Ventures**

We have entered into several joint ventures to access additional geographic markets, further enhance our local
market expertise, minimize costs and increase growth in areas we believe have significant business potential. For
an overview of our joint ventures, see the notes to the Financial Statements included elsewhere herein. When
entering into joint ventures, we generally seek control over the joint undertaking.

**Regulatory and Compliance**

We do business in certain countries that are subject to economic Sanctions or are known to have weak measures
against money laundering and terrorist financing, including Russia, Iran, Lebanon, Yemen, Libya, Sudan and
Myanmar. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our sales in these countries, excluding Russia, accounted for
€5.5 million. Our sales in Russia for the year ended December 31, 2021 were €488.7 million.

Many countries, including the U.S. and the UK, exempt pharmaceutical products, such as ours, from the scope of
Sanctions imposed by them. Nevertheless, we have specific procedures in place to ensure that our exports into
countries subject to economic Sanctions comply with the relevant international, regional and national regulations.
We follow a risk-based approach, which means, for example, prior to entering into a contract with a customer, we
conduct due diligence on our customers and obtain documentation from them that verifies their identity as well
as the identity of their end customers and, in certain cases, beneficial owners. In addition, we tailor our contracts
to the specific contractual partners and export countries, providing for specific payment terms and requiring
specific guarantees. See “Management Discussion & Analysis _– Conflict between Russia and Ukraine.” and “Risk_
_Factors – Political instability and military action involving Ukraine, Belarus and Russia may affect our business_
_and results of operations.”_

**Legal Proceedings**

From time to time, we become involved in various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of our
business, such as labor law related claims; disputes with our suppliers, authorities, non-controlling shareholders
or business partners; health and safety and environmental issues; and intellectual property disputes. We do not
currently consider any of our pending lawsuits to be material.

Otherwise, we are currently not involved in any legal proceedings which, either individually or in the aggregate,
are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. We note, however,
that the outcome of legal proceedings can be extremely difficult to predict, and we offer no assurances in this
regard.

###### REGULATION

**_COVID-19_**

The global outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in significant disruptions to businesses around the world. As a
result, several of the jurisdictions in which we operate have implemented, or are in the process of implementing,
emergency legislation in order to address the impact of the pandemic, including its impact on the availability of
pharmaceuticals. For example, Serbia has implemented a temporary export ban for certain categories of medical
products to other countries. Germany has enacted legislation allowing pharmacists to disregard, under certain
conditions, rebate agreements between pharmaceutical companies and social health insurance providers that
would normally grant exclusivity to pharmaceutical companies for certain medicinal products. In addition, the
German Ministry of Health has enacted statutory measures that would allow the relevant authorities to intervene
in order to ensure a continuous supply of certain categories of medicines to the entire population, including by
prohibiting companies from supplying certain categories of medicines to their customers or imposing restrictions
on pricing. Italy has also enacted a wide range of emergency regulations, including measures allowing the Italian
Medicines Agency to accelerate approvals for the use of certain generics products at the expense of the National
Health System and foster cooperation with holders of marketing authorizations and importers in order to ensure
regular supply levels of certain categories of critical medical products. Spain has enacted regulations to facilitate
the use and supply of essential medical products and devices, including measures facilitating the import of medical
products and price control regulations on certain categories of supplies. In addition, Russia has introduced
temporary restrictions with respect to the export of single use medical devices as well as active pharmaceutical
ingredients and the procedure for registering Russian medical equipment has been significantly simplified,
including for respirators and medical masks. Russia has also passed legislation allowing the sale of non-registered,
foreign made and single use medical devices without obtaining permission from the Russian Federal Service for
Surveillance in Healthcare, subject to compliance with certain conditions, including a simplified registration
procedure.

We have incurred costs in order to comply with these temporary regulations. However, as of the date of this
Exchange Offer Memorandum, such costs have been relatively limited and current regulations have not had a
material adverse impact on our business. Because the majority of the current regulations are either temporary in
nature or provide optional measures that can be enacted in the government’s discretion but which have not been
enacted yet, there can be no assurance that future changes in regulatory measures related to COVID-19 would not
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We continue to monitor the
legislative environment, particularly in regards to export bans or any other form of direct intervention by
governments in the market for medical products and supplies, including price control measures and suspension of
discount agreements, as well as in relation to workplace safety. See “Risk Factors— _Risks Relating to Our_
_Business and Industry—Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been, and may continue_
_to be, adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 public health pandemic.”_

**European Union**

**_Overview (Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom)_**

The Group’s pharmaceutical business activity comprises the following regulated activity: (i) medicinal product
development (the Group does not conduct any material proprietary research for new active pharmaceutical
ingredients); (ii) medicinal product authorization; (iii) manufacturing and the procurement of contract
manufacturing; (iv) wholesale distribution and supply; (v) pharmacovigilance; and (vi) promotion. The current
range of medicinal products comprises generic, biosimilar, prescription only and OTC medicinal products. Each
of these activities is subject to strict legislative frameworks at both European Union and national levels compliance
with which requires the expenditure of substantial personnel and financial resources, and breach of which can
result in enforcement activity under civil, administrative and/or criminal law.

While the Group also commercializes products that are regulated as medical devices, cosmetic products and food
supplements, the text below summarizes the material licenses and regulatory aspects of the pharmaceutical
product regulatory regimes text are applicable to the material parts of the Group’s pharmaceutical business in
Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, the violation of which could result in: (i) the suspension or
revocation of licenses or registrations; (ii) the limitation, suspension or termination of service; and/or (iii) the
imposition of civil, administrative and criminal penalties, including fines.

**_European Union Pharmaceutical Regulatory Regime_**

_Non clinical and Clinical Investigations_

Both non clinical and clinical data (i.e., from studies involving human participants) are generally required to
support a marketing authorization for a medicinal product. Appropriate studies are therefore required, the conduct
of which in the EEA is carefully regulated under EU Directives 2010/63/EU, 2004/9/EC, 2004/10/EC and
2001/20/EC, respectively, and corresponding member state national laws. To the extent that non clinical research
is conducted on animals, it is subject to significant legislative restrictions. In particular, the person conducting
such research and the research project itself must be authorized by a relevant competent authority. The
establishment where the animal research takes place must also be compliant with the legislation—this entails an
additional authorization under national legislation.

As regards the initiation and conduct of clinical trials, many of the legal obligations in directive 2001/20/EC and
its associated good clinical practice Directive 2005/28/EC fall on the “sponsor” of the clinical trial, which is
defined as the individual, company, institution or organization that takes responsibility for the initiation,
management and/or financing of a clinical trial. Before commencement of a clinical trial, the sponsor must obtain
authorization from the competent authority/ies in the member state(s) in which the trial will be conducted.
Approval from a competent national ethics committee in each of the relevant member states is also a prerequisite
to commencing a trial. The European Union clinical trial legislation also imposes requirements regarding the
conduct of directive trial itself (which must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice (“GCP”) to
generate data acceptable for marketing authorization submission) and safety reporting of adverse events and
reactions, among other matters. If clinical trials are conducted outside the EEA, they must likewise follow the
principles set forth in European Union legislation if their results are to be submitted in an application for marketing
authorization in the European Union in order for the data they generate to be accepted. These requirements also
apply to bioavailability studies conducted to demonstrate acceptable bioequivalence of generic medicinal products
to innovative products.

The regulation of clinical trials conducted in the EEA will undergo significant change when the European Union
Clinical Trials Regulation comes into effect, which the EMA expects to occur during 2020.

_Marketing Authorizations_

The European Union regulatory framework applicable to medicinal products is largely set forth in the
“Community” code contained in Directive 2001/83/EC as implemented in the respective national laws of EEA
Member States. Subject to certain narrow exemptions, this requires that all medicinal products, including generic
versions of authorized (including previously authorized) products, must obtain a marketing authorization before
they can be lawfully placed on the market in the EEA. There are three main procedures for applying for marketing
authorization: the Centralized Procedure (operated by the EMA and the Commission under EC Regulation
726/2004), the Mutual Recognition Procedure and the Decentralized Procedure, both operated by EEA Member
State national authorities under the rules set forth in Directive 2001/83/EC. It is also possible to obtain a purely
national, stand-alone authorization for products intended for marketing only in a single EEA Member State.

Under the Centralized Procedure, applications must be made to the EMA for an authorization granted in the form
of a single binding Commission decision to grant a Community (as defined in the relevant directive) marketing
authorization which is simultaneously valid in each of the EEA Member States. The Centralized Procedure is
mandatory for biotechnology products. It is also mandatory for advanced therapy medicinal products for new
active substances to treat cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, AIDS, autoimmune diseases or other
immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, and for products designated as orphan medicinal products. It is also
available, on an optional basis, for other new chemical entities or innovative medicinal products, or in the interests
of public health, which may also include applications for Community marketing authorizations for nonprescription and generic medicinal products of nationally authorized reference products. For generic marketing
authorization applications of Community authorized reference medicinal products (which have been authorized
under the Centralized Procedure), there is automatic access to the Centralized Procedure.

The Mutual Recognition Procedure and the Decentralized Procedure each aims to facilitate access to the EEA
single market by relying upon the principle of mutual recognition. Thus, a marketing authorization or the
assessment in one EEA Member State (the reference EEA Member State) ought in principle to be recognized by
the competent authorities of the other EEA Member States (the concerned EEA Member States (“CMSs”), unless
there are grounds for supposing that the authorization of the medicinal product concerned may present a serious

261


-----

risk to public health. Under both procedures, if the application is successful, the CMSs grant a national marketing
authorization for the medicinal product.

Under all marketing authorization procedures the applicant must submit a dossier containing, among other items,
data demonstrating the safety, quality and efficacy of the medicinal product. For generic medicinal products, there
are reduced data submission requirements (no preclinical or clinical study results are required although
bioequivalence must be substantiated, usually via appropriate bioavailability studies). For similar biological
medicinal products (biosimilars) some preclinical and/or clinical studies performed for the original reference
product may not need to be reproduced as a biosimilar application is based on a comparison between the biosimilar
and its reference medicine to show that there are no significant differences between them.

At the time of the grant of a marketing authorization for a medicinal product, the competent authority must specify
the classification of the product as either prescription only or not. National laws may make provision for certain
sub categories. It is open to the marketing authorization holder to subsequently apply for an amendment of this
classification (either way) subject to filing relevant supporting additional data.

_Manufacturing and Contract Manufacturing_

The European Union Community Code in directive 2001/83/EC contains substantial requirements for the
manufacturing of medicinal products, which are required to be manufactured in accordance with the principles of
GMP set forth in Commission directive 2003/94/EC. Manufacturing activity includes the importing of or the total
or partial manufacture (including the various processes of dividing up, packaging and presenting) of medicinal
products. There are also prescriptive requirements relating to the content and design of the packaging and labeling
of medicinal products. These include certain mandatory information which must be stated on the product label,
packaging and patient information leaflet.

The manufacturer must ensure that all manufacturing operations for medicinal products subject to a marketing
authorization are carried out in accordance with the information provided in the application for marketing
authorization as accepted by the competent authorities. Any manufacturing operation or linked operation, that is
carried out under contract for the manufacturer, must be the subject of a written contract between the manufacturer
and the subcontractor which defines and allocates the responsibilities of each party and which defines, in
particular, the observances of GMP to be followed by each party. The manufacturer must monitor and review the
subcontractor’s performance.

If manufacturing activity is undertaken within the EEA, a valid manufacturing authorization from the relevant
Member State is required for the category of products concerned and which covers the type of manufacturing
activity undertaken (e.g., importing or packaging, etc.). The holder of a manufacturing authorization is obligated
to comply with the principles and guidelines of GMP for medicinal products and to use as starting materials only
active pharmaceutical ingredients that have been manufactured in accordance with the GMP for active substances.
Excipients for use in medicinal products must also be produced in accordance with appropriate GMP to be
determined following a formal risk assessment. As a matter of GMP compliance, the manufacturer must verify
via site audits that suppliers and distributors of active substances are each complying with GMP and good
distribution practice principles. Manufacturers are subject to regular inspections by competent authorities to assess
their compliance with GMP. Manufacturers must also appoint a “qualified person” who is responsible for
certifying that individual batches of medicinal product satisfy legal requirements.

Manufacturing authorizations must be issued by the member state authority where the manufacturing activity and
plant is located and are holder and site specific. European Union member state competent authorities also
undertake regular GMP inspections of manufacturers located in countries outside the EEA that are engaged in the
manufacture of medicinal products to be supplied to the European Union. A European Union based manufacturer
may only import active substances from outside the EEA if the active substances have been manufactured in
accordance with GMPs equivalent to European Union GMPs for active substances, and if they are accompanied
by a written confirmation from the competent authority of the exporting third country, which as regards the plant
manufacturing the exported active substance, confirms that the standards of GMP and control of the plant are
equivalent to those in the EEA. Alternatively, active substances may be imported from countries on the approved
list of recognized GMP equivalent countries operated by the Commission.

Since 2019, the European Union falsified medicines legislation (now incorporated in Directive 2001/83/EC and
in delegated directives) has imposed additional obligations on manufacturers regarding certain safety and antitamper features to be included in product packaging (where required).

262


-----

_Distribution_

Entities undertaking the wholesale distribution of medicinal products are also required to hold a wholesale dealer’s
authorization from the EEA Member State where the distribution is taking place and must fulfill certain
requirements concerning the suitability and adequacy of premises, installations and equipment, so as to ensure the
proper conservation and distribution of the medicinal products. These requirements also extend to staff. In
particular, a distributor must have a qualified “responsible person” who meets national legislative requirements
regarding qualifications.

Wholesale distribution includes all activities relating to procuring, holding, supplying or exporting medicinal
products, other than supplying medicinal products to the public. Such activities are carried out by manufacturers
or their depositories, importers or other wholesale distributors or by pharmacists and persons authorized or entitled
to supply medicinal products to the public in the Member State concerned.

Distributors are subject to regular site and system inspections by competent authorities to assess the distributor’s
compliance with applicable legal requirements in the Community Code in directive 2001/83/EC, which include
compliance with the principles of European Union GDP. Distributors must keep certain records and
documentation (particularly for the purposes of facilitating product and batch recall) and must operate a quality
system and have a plan for the effective implementation of recalls. Distributors are also obligated to confirm that
entities from whom they obtain supplies of medicinal products have the appropriate authorizations and, where
applicable, have complied with GDP principles. They may also only supply entities who possess appropriate
authorizations.

Since 2019, the European Union’s falsified medicines legislation has imposed additional obligations on
distributors regarding the verification of specified safety and anti-tamper features to be included in product
packaging (where required).

_Pharmacovigilance_

“Pharmacovigilance” refers to the science and activities relating to the detection, assessment, understanding and
prevention of adverse effects or any other medicine related problem. Marketing authorization holders are subject
to detailed and extensive risk management and pharmacovigilance obligations under Directive 2001/83/EC and
EC Regulation 726/2004 and the associated guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices. Among other matters,
these include the implementation of risk minimization measures on a per product basis as well as a requirement
for the marketing authorization holder to operate a pharmacovigilance system to monitor the safety of authorized
medicinal products and to detect any change to their risk benefit balance. Details of the pharmacovigilance system
must be set forth in the pharmacovigilance system master file, which must be maintained by the marketing
authorization holder and kept available for inspection by competent authorities upon request. The marketing
authorization holder must establish and use a “quality system” to perform its pharmacovigilance obligations.

The pharmacovigilance obligations of the marketing authorization holder include detailed obligations regarding
reporting. For example, a marketing authorization holder must record all suspected adverse reactions in the EEA
or in countries outside the EEA that are brought to its attention, and report such information via the centralized
Eudravigilance database. The marketing authorization holder must also submit periodic safety updates to the EMA
regarding the benefits and risks of the medicinal product. Other pharmacovigilance obligations are imposed
regarding the availability to the marketing authorization holder of appropriate personnel and resources. For
example, the marketing authorization holder must have permanently and continuously at its disposal an
appropriately “qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance” who resides in the EEA.

_Promotion_

Directive 2001/83/EC sets out strict rules for the advertising of medicinal products. The concept of advertising is
broadly defined and includes any form of door to door information, canvassing activity or inducement designed
to promote the prescription, supply, sale or consumption of medicinal products. Advertising must not be
misleading and there is a positive obligation for the advertising to encourage the rational use of a medicinal
product, among other matters. All promotional materials and activities must also comply with the official
“Summary of Product Characteristics” which is always issued for an authorized medicinal product by the
authorizing competent authority.

The advertising of medicines in the European Union is permitted subject to certain restrictions in Directive
2001/83/EC as implemented into EU member state laws. For example, the advertising of unauthorized medicines
is prohibited. This includes the advertising of a medicine before a marketing authorization has been granted, as

263


-----

well as the advertising of an authorized medicine for uses (i.e., therapeutic indications) outside the scope of its
marketing authorization (so called “off label” uses). Advertising of prescription only medicines to the general
public is also prohibited, as is the provision of samples to the public for promotional purposes. In addition,
European Union legislation gives EEA Member States a certain degree of flexibility to ensure the adequate and
effective monitoring of advertising, and detailed rules regarding promotion and monitoring are consequently not
fully harmonized across the EEA.

_Sanctions for Infringement Under European Union Law_

Under Commission Regulation 658/2007, the Commission may directly impose financial penalties where the
holder of a Community marketing authorization has intentionally or negligently breached certain obligations set
forth in European Union pharmaceutical legislation. The power to impose financial penalties applies in cases
where the infringement may have significant public health implications in the EEA; where it has a EEA dimension
by taking place or having its effects in more than one Member State; or where interests of the EEA are involved.

In the event of an infringement, the Commission may impose a fine of up to 5% of the marketing authorization
holder’s turnover in the EEA in the preceding year. If the infringement is ongoing, the Commission may impose
penalty payments per day of up to 2.5% of the marketing authorization holder’s average daily EEA turnover in
the preceding business year until such time as the infringement is terminated. The Commission may also impose
a fine of up to 0.5% of the marketing authorization holder’s EEA turnover in the preceding business year if the
marketing authorization holder fails to cooperate with the Commission’s investigation of the potential breach. If
the noncooperation continues, the Commission may impose penalty payments per day of up to 0.5% of the
marketing authorization holder’s average daily EEA turnover in the preceding business year until the
noncooperation is terminated.

EU Regulation 2017/2394/EU on consumer protection cooperation between enforcement authorities came into
force on January 17, 2020. This regulation aims at boosting cross border public enforcement of European Union
consumer protection rules, which includes Directive 2001/83/EC, the Community Code on medicinal products.
There are current Commission proposals to amend this regulation to strengthen the penalties for breaches of
European Union consumer law by introducing fines based upon percentages of the infringer’s turnover.

_Enforcement Under National Law_

Enforcement of the regulatory requirements outlined above takes place at a national level and is underpinned by
national member state law.

_Enforcement Under German Law_

European Union pharmaceutical regulatory legislation is implemented and indirectly enforced in Germany mainly
via the Medicinal Products Act (Arzneimittelgesetz) and various ordinances passed thereunder. General laws also
applicable to the business behavior of pharmaceutical companies are the Administrative Offences Act
(Ordnungswidrigkeitengesetz), the Health Advertising Act (Heilmittelwerbegesetz)—as far as promotional
measures are concerned—and the Criminal Code with its anti-fraud and anti-kickback provisions. A person guilty
of an offense can be liable to a fine or imprisonment under administrative or criminal law, depending on the nature
of the violation. For example, any person who acts negligently or who willfully or negligently fails to operate a
pharmacovigilance system or fails to fulfill certain general pharmacovigilance obligations shall be deemed to have
committed an administrative offense. Committing an administrative offense may result in a fine not exceeding
€25,000. A violation of the Health Advertising Act can lead to an administrative offense; however, in practice,
these aspects (such as requests for preliminary injunctions initiated by a competitor or competition associations)
are mainly dealt with in civil law proceedings.

The German competent authorities, which are both authorities at the national level (particularly the Federal
Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM)) and at the regional level (the administrative authorities in the
respective federal states) have a range of enforcement powers. As well as the power to prosecute a company and/or
individual responsible, the competent authorities have investigatory powers enabling them to enter, inspect and
search premises and seize medicinal products. The competent authorities can also suspend or revoke any German
marketing authorization or manufacturing authorization, wholesale dealer authorization, thereby preventing the
holder from carrying on these respective activities. As regards enforcement of the restrictions on promotional
activities, in practice this is typically done through civil law proceedings brought by competitors and/or
associations for fair competition.

264

_Enforcement Under Italian Law_

European Union pharmaceutical regulatory legislation is enforced in Italy under criminal and administrative
sanctions set forth in Legislative Decrees 211/2003 (“Attuazione della direttiva 2001/20/CE relativa
_all’applicazione della buona pratica clinica nell’esecuzione delle sperimentazioni cliniche di medicinali per uso_
_clinico”) and 219/2006 (“Attuazione della direttiva 2001/83/CE (e successive direttive di modifica) relativa ad un_
_codice comunitario concernente i medicinali per uso umano”). National Pharmacovigilance aspects and_
obligations are also regulated by Italian Ministerial Decree 30[th] April 2015, transposing European directives on
pharmacovigilance (Directives 2010/84/EU and 2012/26/EU).

Non-compliance with the above-mentioned European Union legislation, also as implemented in Italy, can result
in, among others: (i) the modification, suspension or revocation of marketing authorizations, (ii) the prohibition
to manufacture, market, import, distribute and advertise medicinal products, as well as (iii) the withdrawal from
the market and seizure of stocks of medicinal products. The Italian Medicine Agency (AIFA) and the other
competent authorities for pharmacovigilance are entrusted with a wide range of enforcement powers, including
undertaking inspections and audits, and issuing interdictory measures and monetary fines.

In addition, the Italian Criminal Code provides for additional penalties for persons guilty of criminal offences.
For instance, Article 443 of the Italian Criminal Code makes the trade in or administration of faulty medicinal
products (i.e., expired drugs) a punishable offense and provides for imprisonment from six months to three years
and a fine of not less than € 103. In addition, under Article 445 of the Criminal Code, the trade of medicinal
substances, in species, quality or quantity not corresponding to medical orders, or different from that declared or
agreed, is punishable with imprisonment of six months to two years and with a fine of € 103 - 1.032.

Moreover, Legislative Decree 231/2001 provides for the administrative liability of legal entities (including
companies) arising from certain criminal offences (i.e., bribery and corruption, money laundering, corporate
crimes, environmental crimes or crimes against industry and trade, etc.) perpetrated by senior managers (i.e., a
director, manager or senior executive) or employees for the benefit or the advantage of the company. In particular,
Legislative Decree 231/2001 sets out the following administrative penalties: (i) financial penalties (a fine of up to
€ 1,549,000), (ii) prohibitory penalties - such as a ban on performing the activity, the suspension or withdrawal of
licenses, authorizations and concessions (i.e., pharma licenses); a ban on contracting with public entities (i.e.,
public tenders); the exclusion from concessions, loans, grants and subsidies and possible revocation of those
already granted; a ban on advertising goods and services -; iii) confiscation; iv) publication of judgment.

Companies may avoid this administrative liability by approving and actually implementing a suitable compliance
program (the s.c. “organizational model”) containing a system of procedures and supervisory activities aimed at
preventing the commission of such offenses, and appointing a Supervisory Body (“Organismo di Vigilanza” or
“OdV”) in charge of assessing the effectiveness of the organizational model. However, the release from liability
of the company depends on the “suitability judgement” and the determination on the preventive effectiveness of
the organizational model, which the criminal judge must give in criminal proceedings to the detriment of the
offender. This means that in the event of a final conviction for an offense listed in the catalogue of Legislative
Decree 231/2001, if the criminal judge concerned finds that (i) the organizational model adopted by the company
is not suitable for preventing the specific crime concerned, (ii) the organizational model has not been effectively
implemented or (iii) the activities of the OdV are insufficient, the company will be liable and subject to the
administrative penalties described above.

_Enforcement Under Spanish Law_

The Spanish pharmaceutical industry enforcement regime mainly comprises administrative law rules and regulates
the clinical investigation, marketing, manufacturing, distribution, pharmacovigilance and promotion of medicinal
products. In line with European Union legislation, medicinal products must receive a marketing authorization
granted by the Spanish Agency of Medicinal Products (“AEMPS”), which belongs to the Ministry of Health and
Social Services, before medicinal products can be placed on the market. Additionally, manufacturers, importers
and marketers of medicinal products are required to hold an authorization granted by the AEMPS. Authorization
holders shall comply with security, effectiveness, identification and information obligations regarding the
medicinal products marketed. Once the regulatory authorizations are granted, the latter are added to the AEMPS
registry and communicated to the EMA for information purposes that are available to the public.

Spanish state and regional authorities are empowered to investigate any conduct, to enter into any establishment
or to seize any sample in order to verify compliance of the legislation. Failure to comply with the legislation may
result in administrative fines that can be imposed on the authorization holder of up to €30,000 for minor

265


-----

infringements, €90,000 for serious infringements or €1,000,000, or five times the value of the medicinal products
involved, for very serious infringements; seizure of the illegal benefit obtained; closure of the establishment;
suspension of corresponding activities or/and the withdrawal of the medicinal product from the market.

Additionally, if the aforementioned conduct, and other related conduct described in articles 361 et seq. of the
Spanish Criminal Code, endanger human life and health, those provisions establish as penalties for the person
who commits the criminal offense a prison sentence of up to four years, a fine which will depend on his or her
economic situation and a specific disqualification from the exercise of his or her profession or from trading. In
some circumstances the company itself can be liable for the conduct perpetuated by its employees, in which case,
article 366 of the Spanish Criminal Code provides for fines up to five times the medicinal products involved and
anticipates the possibility of also imposing other penalties, such as the winding up of the company, suspension of
its activity, closure of its establishments, prohibition from carrying out its activities, prohibiting the obtaining
public subsidies and judicial intervention.

**United Kingdom**

**_Overview_**

The UK, formally left the EU on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as “Brexit”. The post-Brexit transition
period, during which EU pharmaceutical laws continued to apply to the UK, expired on December 31, 2020. This
means that since January 1, 2021, the UK operates under a distinct regulatory regime. EU pharmaceutical laws
now only apply to the UK in respect of Northern Ireland (as laid out in the Protocol on Ireland and Northern
Ireland, including but not limited to marketing authorization applications).

Since January 1, 2021, EU laws which have been transposed into UK law through secondary legislation continue
to be applicable as “retained EU law”. As there is no general power to amend this “retained EU law”, the UK
government introduced a new Medicines and Medical Devices Act which seeks to address regulatory gaps through
implementing regulations and delegated powers covering the fields of human medicines, clinical trials of human
medicines, veterinary medicines and medical devices. The purpose of the legislation is to enable the existing UK
regulatory frameworks to be updated. Although regulatory authorities in the UK have indicated that new UK rules
will closely align with EU laws, detailed proposals are yet to be published.

On December 24, 2020 the EU and UK concluded a trade and cooperation agreement, or TCA, which has been
provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021. The TCA includes certain provisions affecting pharmaceutical
companies such as customs and tariffs in relation to healthcare products and provides for the mutual recognition
of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued. It is important
to note that significant regulatory gaps still exist and the TCA does not contain wholesale mutual recognition of
UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations and product standards between the parties, for example, in relation to
batch testing and pharmacovigilance which remain subject to further bilateral discussions.

_Clinical Trials_

The UK regulatory framework in relation to clinical trials is derived from existing EU legislation (as implemented
into UK law, through secondary legislation), and after Brexit, EU laws on clinical trials (including the CTR) are
no longer directly applicable in Great Britain. There is a risk that the UK Medicines and Healthcare products
Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) may diverge from the EU to maintain regulatory flexibility and changes impacting
the ability to conduct trials spanning several EU countries will need to be monitored going forward.

_Marketing Authorizations_

The MHRA is now the UK’s standalone regulator for MA applications. All existing centralized procedure MAs
were automatically converted into UK MAs effective in Great Britain (i.e. the UK excluding Northern Ireland)
and issued with a UK MA number on 1 January 2021 (unless marketing authorization holders opted out of this
scheme by 21 January 2021). As a result of the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol, centralized
procedure MAs remain valid for marketing products in Northern Ireland. Converted EU MAs will be treated as if
they were granted on the date the corresponding centralized procedure MA was granted and the renewal date will
stay the same.

Following January 1, 2021, an applicant for a centralized procedure MA must be established in the EU. After this
date, companies established in the UK cannot use the centralized procedure and instead must follow one of the
UK national authorization procedures or one of the remaining post-Brexit international cooperation procedures to
obtain a MA to market products in the UK. In addition, for a two-year period from 1 January 2021, MHRA may

266


-----

rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new centralized procedure MA when
determining an application for a Great Britain MA; or use the MHRA’s decentralized or mutual recognition
procedures which enable MAs approved in EU member states (or Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway) to be granted
in Great Britain. Additionally, the ‘Unfettered Access Procedure’ enables a marketing authorization holder in
Northern Ireland to seek recognition in Great Britain. Post Brexit, the MHRA has been updating various aspects
of the regulatory regime for medicines in the UK, including: introducing the Innovative Licensing and Access
Procedure to accelerate the time to market and facilitate patient access for innovative medicines; updates to the
UK national approval procedure, introducing a 150-day objective for assessing applications for MAs in the UK,
Great Britain and Northern Ireland and a rolling review process for MA applications (rather than a consolidated
full dossier submission).

_Enforcement Under United Kingdom Law_

Pharmaceutical regulatory legislation is generally enforced in the United Kingdom under criminal law via offenses
set forth in the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and the Medicines Act 1968. A person guilty of an offense is
generally liable to up to two years’ imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine. Liability can arise for a corporate
offender and for individual officers of the company (or any person purporting to act in such capacity). Members
of the company may also be liable if the affairs of the company are managed by its members.

The United Kingdom competent authority has a range of enforcement powers. As well as prosecuting the company
and/or individual responsible, the competent authority has investigatory powers enabling it to enter, inspect and
search premises and seize medicinal products. The competent authority can also suspend or revoke any United
Kingdom marketing authorization, manufacturing authorization or wholesale dealer authorization, thereby
preventing the holder from carrying on these respective activities.

**Russia**

**_Overview_**

The development, non-clinical/clinical trial development, registration, manufacture, safety, storage,
transportation, advertising, sale, use and destruction of pharmaceuticals in the Russian Federation is strictly
regulated by national laws, and since May 6, 2017 by the regulations of the Eurasian Economic Union (the
“EAEU”) on the united pharmaceutical market, formed by its members Armenia, Belorussia, Kazakhstan, Kirgizia
and Russia. The regulations of the EAEU as international law take precedence over national legislation. The
EAEU regulations cover the registration of pharmaceuticals, labelling, packaging, good practices and
pharmacovigilance. Obtaining clinical trial approvals, licensing, price formation, state procurement and
advertising are the exclusive competence of each member state.

_Non clinical/Clinical Trial Development_

Prior to applying for the registration of a pharmaceutical product, non-clinical studies and clinical trials are
arranged by a “sponsor,” if necessary. The sponsor is the organization with a license to conduct pharmaceutical
activities, which owns the results of the studies and/or the relevant pharmaceutical manufacturing technologies.
All studies must confirm the pharmaceutical quality of the products and demonstrate their safety and efficacy.

For non-clinical studies (biomedical studies not performed on human subjects), the laboratory where the relevant
research takes place is subject to strict controls by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. Pursuant to
EAEU legislation, preclinical research on animals may not be conducted with respect to generic drugs.

The sponsor is obligated to conduct relevant studies according to the clinical trial permission granted by the
Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. Such permission is granted after the Ministry conducts a review of
the application and accompanying documents submitted by the sponsor or any person authorized by the developer.

Clinical research conducted on humans is subject to stringent regulations imposed by the Ministry of Health and
the Ethical Board of the Russian Federation. In particular, a person conducting such research (i.e., the principal
investigator) must have relevant experience consisting of at least three years of studies in clinical trials and
extensive medical practice in the relevant therapeutic area. In addition, the institution where the research takes
place must be authorized by the Ministry of Health. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP.
Successful results of clinical trials are a mandatory condition for the registration of a pharmaceutical product.

267


-----

_Registration Process_

Pharmaceuticals can be manufactured, stored, transported, sold, used or destroyed only upon obtaining a
registration certificate (or a marketing authorization) issued by the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation.

At the applicant’s option, the registration procedure can be carried out in accordance with Russian or EAEU
regulations. Depending on the option chosen, an issued registration certificate will be valid in the territory of the
Russian Federation or in all EAEU member states, respectively. After December 31, 2020, applicants for new
registrations must file documents only with the EAEU (the national procedure will not be applicable). All valid
registration dossiers of those pharmaceuticals that were previously registered under national rules must be brought
into full compliance with the unified rules of the EAEU by December 31, 2025.

Under Russian regulations, the duration of the registration process ranges from 130 working days (for the
registration of the first three generic pharmaceuticals) to 160 working days (for generic and original
pharmaceuticals), excluding a possible suspension for up to 90 days. EAEU regulations envisage 140 working
days as the maximum duration of the registration process, excluding two possible suspensions of up to 90 days
each. Clinical trials are not included in that term. Usually the whole registration process takes at least one and a
half to two years for original and approximately eight to twelve months for generic pharmaceuticals.

Usually, the official fee for the examination of pharmaceuticals amounts from ₽135,000 to ₽420,000 plus an
additional ₽10,000 in order to obtain a registration certificate issued by the Ministry of Health of the Russian
Federation. The cost of clinical trials is calculated individually for each pharmaceutical and is not included in the
official fee. EAEU registration official fees are approved at the governmental level. The results of clinical trials
conducted in other EAEU states as well as in the member states of the International Conference on the
Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use may be accepted
as part of the application.

After being granted, the registration certificate can be annulled by the Ministry of Health for a number of reasons,
including danger to health, infringement of the rights of a third-party in the absence of the pharmaceutical from
the Russian market for more than three years, among others.

Violations such as manufacturing or selling of unregistered pharmaceuticals can lead to a fine of up to ₽5,000,000
or to the suspension of the licensed activity for up to 90 days. Suspension of the activity can only be ordered by a
court. If violations have not been remedied after the expiration of the suspension period, the license for
manufacturing pharmaceuticals (see below) can be annulled upon application of the appropriate regulatory body
by a ruling of the court.

If the value of the manufactured or sold unregistered pharmaceuticals exceeds ₽100,000, an individual (such as a
senior executive or another employee of the company) found responsible may be subject to criminal sanctions of
up to eight years of imprisonment and a fine in the amount of: (i) up to ₽3,000,000 or (ii) the income of the
offender for a period from six months to three years. The offender may also be prohibited from occupying certain
posts or engaging in certain activities for up to five years.

In the case of the death of two or more people or grievous harm caused by an unregistered pharmaceutical, the
term of imprisonment can be up to twelve years with a fine in the amount of: (i) up to ₽5,000,000 or (ii) the income
of the responsible person for a period of two to five years. The offender may also be prohibited from occupying
certain posts or engaging in certain activities for up to ten years.

_Manufacturing and Distributing Pharmaceuticals_

Manufacturing pharmaceuticals requires a license and a GMP certificate, both of which are issued by the Ministry
of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation. Manufacturing pharmaceuticals without a license is a criminal
offense and may lead to imprisonment for up to eight years and a fine in the amount of: (i) up to ₽3,000,000 or
(ii) the income of the offender for one to three years.

If ethanol is used in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical substance, it must be recorded in the Unified State
Automated System (“USAS”) in order to control the volumes and circulation of pharmaceutical products
containing alcohol. Failure to comply with the USAS record requirements can lead to a fine of up to ₽200,000
and to the confiscation of the pharmaceutical products. On January 1, 2018, new requirements relating to ethanol
usage entered into force. Pursuant to these new requirements, if ethanol (or ethanol as a pharmaceutical substance)
is used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products or medical devices, it must be recorded in USAS in order
to control the volumes of manufacture and circulation of pharmaceutical products containing alcohol.

268


-----

For laboratory activities that use agents that cause infectious diseases and genetically modified organisms of a
pathogenicity level of III and IV, a company needs a license or has to rely on companies with such licenses. The
license is issued by the Federal Service on Surveillance for Consumer Rights Protection and Human Well-being.
A major change of control of a license holder entity is subject to prior approval by a special governmental
committee.

The distribution (whether wholesale or retail) of pharmaceuticals requires a license for pharmaceutical activity,
issued by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. A recent law (dd. April 3, 2020 No. 105 FZ) allows
the online purchase and sale of OTC drugs, also the Russian government has established the procedure for issuing
permits for the online purchase and sale of OTC drugs.

The manufacture and distribution of pharmaceuticals containing narcotics, psychotropic substances or their
precursors is subject to an additional license for the circulation of such substances. The license is issued by the
Federal Service for Supervision in Healthcare of the Russian Federation.

Violation of the regulations the manufacture or distribution of pharmaceuticals can lead to a fine of up to ₽30,000
provided such actions do not violate licensing requirements (mandatory requirements with which license holder
must comply). As a general rule, violation of any licensing requirements can lead to a fine of up to ₽40,000. Major
violations of the license requirements can lead to a fine of up to ₽200,000 or a suspension of the licensed activity
(e.g., distribution) for up to 90 days. The activity can be suspended only upon a ruling by a court. If major
violations have not been remedied after the expiration of the suspension period, the license can be annulled upon
application to a court by the respective regulatory body.

_Pharmacovigilance (Pharmaceutical Safety Monitoring)_

A company is required to establish a pharmacovigilance system, which includes the appointment of a qualified
person to collect, assess and report safety information with regard to the benefit/risk assessment of the product
and any adverse events.

After a product registration certificate has been granted, the registration certificate holder must submit periodic
safety reports to the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. In addition, the registration certificate holder
must continuously monitor the benefit/risk balance of the product and implement and monitor procedures for the
performance of adverse event collection, evaluation and reporting, the updating of risk management plans and
must take other pharmacovigilance measures.

The Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare will inform the Ministry of Health of any negative safety
information it obtains, as a result of which the latter can suspend the circulation of the pharmaceutical or revoke
the registration certificate.

For the nondisclosure of adverse events, the registration certificate holder can be charged with a fine of up to
₽70,000. If such nondisclosure creates a danger to people, animals or the environment, the individual responsible
may bear criminal liability and be charged with a fine of up to ₽300,000 and imprisoned for up to two years. The
offender may also be prohibited from holding certain positions and engaging in certain activities for a period of
up to three years or, in the case of serious harm caused by such non-disclosure, the offender can be charged with
a fine of up to ₽500,000 and imprisoned for up to five years.

_Promotion of Pharmaceuticals_

The promotion of registered pharmaceuticals is permitted, subject to certain restrictions. For example, the
advertising of pharmaceuticals may not: (i) contain specific cases of recovery or expressions of gratitude from
patients, (ii) create an impression of the advantages of the product by referring to mandatory clinical trials, (iii)
create an impression of the necessity of using the advertised product for certain diseases, (iv) create an impression
of the absence of the need to consult a healthcare professional, (v) guarantee the positive impact or safety of, and
the absence of any side effects caused by, the advertised product, (vi) advertise a pharmaceutical product as a
biologically active supplement or (vii) claim that the safety and efficiency of the pharmaceutical product are
guaranteed by its natural origin.

Prescription pharmaceuticals can be advertised only during special events for healthcare professionals or in media
specially designated for healthcare professionals. In such cases, advertising may refer to specific patient case
studies. Prescription pharmaceuticals may not be advertised to consumers.

269


-----

Advertising compliance is regulated by the Federal Antitrust Service of the Russian Federation. Violation of the
pharmaceuticals advertising legislation can lead to a fine up to 500,000 for each individual violation.

_VEP Circulation_

The Russian government approves a list of VEPs annually. This list includes international nonproprietary names
of pharmaceuticals for treating the most common or top priority conditions. VEPs’ maximum prices must be
approved by and registered with the Ministry of Health and Federal Antitrust Service. Overpricing can result in a
fine of double the amount of excess earnings (i.e., the amount earned by the overcharge) for the period of the
violations, up to a maximum period of one year.

VEPs produced abroad are subject to restrictions for state procurement purposes: if two or more national or EAEU
analogous products participate in a state procurement procedure, the foreign product is excluded from the tender.

National manufacturers of VEPs can also apply for subsidies from the government.

**Reimbursement of Medicinal Products**

**_The European Union Directive on the Transparency of Measures Regulating the Pricing of Medicinal Products_**
**_(89/105/EEC)_**

Directive 89/105/EEC places obligations on EEA Member States in respect of their regulation of the pricing of
medicinal products. These obligations include: prescribed time periods in which a competent authority must
respond to an application for approval of the price of or increase in the price of a medicinal product (where such
approval is required before the product can be marketed or the price increase implemented, respectively);
obligations to regularly review price freezes to consider the justification of such price freezes and prescribed time
periods for announcing the results of such reviews; requirements to give reasons for certain decisions; obligations
to publish prescribed information and provide prescribed information to the Commission regarding products for
which prices have been fixed and the prices that may be charged, including any price increases; and time periods
for communicating decisions (including exclusions) on whether reimbursement of a medicinal product will be
covered by a national health insurance system. These obligations include communicating criteria used by national
social security systems for the therapeutic classification of medicinal products as well as criteria used by
competent authorities to verify transfer pricing used by companies for active pharmaceutical ingredients,
intermediate manufactured or finished medicinal products.

Member States are also obligated to publish information and to communicate to the Commission regarding the
methods and criteria they apply to define profitability, return on sales and/or return on capital, including the ranges
of target profit permitted and the maximum percentage of profit permitted to persons placing medicinal products
on the market.

**_Reimbursement of Medicinal Products in Germany_**

_Reimbursement Regime_

Health insurance coverage is compulsory in Germany. There are two different types of insurance: (i) statutory
health insurance and (ii) private health insurance. For an employee, membership in the statutory health insurance
system is mandatory unless their income rises above an annually determined threshold. In the German healthcare
system medicinal products are reimbursed to the patient, either by the statutory health insurance, in which case
the patient does not need to pay directly for the products (except for a low co-payment), or by the private health
insurance, in which case the patient first pays for the product and then receives a reimbursement from the private
health insurer.

For reimbursements of medicinal products under statutory health insurance, a distinction needs to be made
between prescription drugs and nonprescription drugs. Prescription only medicinal products are only available on
prescription by a doctor, dentist or veterinarian (Section 48 of the German Medicinal Products Act). In general,
under current rules and regulations, the reimbursement system applies to all prescription drugs with the exception
of:

- medicinal products for the treatment of colds and flu like infections, including cold remedies, painkillers,
cough steaming treatment or cough expectorants;

- mouth and throat therapeutics not involving fungal infection;

270


-----

- laxatives;

- medication for travel sickness;

- medication that primarily focuses on improving the quality of life;

- erectile dysfunction;

- increase of sexual potency;

- cessation of smoking;

- emaciation;

- curbing appetite;

- weight regulation; and

- improvement of hair growth.

The reimbursement of nonprescription medicinal products is restricted. In general, nonprescription products are
not part of the reimbursement system if the insured person is more than twelve years old and does not have a
developmental disorder before the end of the 18th year of life (Section 34 para.1 of Volume V of the Social
Insurance Code). Outside the reimbursement framework manufacturers are permitted to set prices at will.

_Price Setting_

For the sale of medicinal products, German law provides for a pricing framework to ensure consistent prices for
the same medicinal products. For the “pharmaceutical entrepreneur” (usually the marketing authorization holder)
of medicinal products, the principle of free pricing for products generally applies. However, a restriction on free
pricing may result from the “benefit assessment” according to the Social Insurance Code. In essence, the
marketing authorization holder must prove additional benefits over comparable available products. If the
marketing authorization holder fails and there is no therapeutic improvement on the basis of the benefit assessment
then the medicinal product will be added to the existing reference pricing list. This also has an economic pressure
effect on the marketing authorization holder to reduce prices to the existing reference pricing list in order to be
competitive in the market. If an innovative (i.e., nongeneric) medicinal product demonstrates additional benefits
because there is a therapeutic improvement then the price can be negotiated between the marketing authorization
holder and the German federal association of statutory health insurance funds. For products in the generics market
there is a mandatory discount of 10% of the ex-factory price if they are distributed at the expense of the public
health care system (Section 130a of Volume V of the Social Insurance Code). There can also be other restrictions
in Volume V of the Social Insurance Code, such as a regulation of reference prices and compulsory manufacturer
discounts.

In addition, a pharmaceutical entrepreneur must guarantee a uniform sales price for medicinal products that are to
be dispensed exclusively in pharmacies and are subject to reimbursement by the statutory health insurance.

In the case of nonprescription medicinal products that are to be reimbursed by the statutory health insurance, a
pharmaceutical entrepreneur shall specify its uniform sales price from which exceptions may be made in
individual cases (Section 78 of the Medicinal Products Act).

**_Reimbursement of Medicinal Products in England & Wales_**

In England and Wales, the measures adopted for regulating the pricing of medicines vary according to the type of
medicine. The generic term “Government” is used in this context to refer to the Department of Health and other
United Kingdom NHS bodies running the public health service in England and Wales.

Branded Medicines

The PPRS is a voluntary scheme open to manufacturers and suppliers which regulates the pricing of branded
medicines (including branded generics) supplied to the United Kingdom NHS and which was in place until the
end of 2018. It therefore did not cover sales of unbranded generics to the United Kingdom NHS or any sales
outside the United Kingdom NHS (e.g., private prescription sales or non-United Kingdom NHS OTC sales).

271


-----

According to Government figures released at the end of 2016, in 2015 almost 90% of branded medicines supplied
to the United Kingdom NHS were supplied by PPRS members.

Key features of the PPRS was as follows:

- A profit cap for individual members who elected to be part of the scheme and a general repayment across
all members where United Kingdom NHS spend on branded medicines exceeds predicted growth levels.

- In relation to product pricing, there is freedom of pricing at launch where new active substances were
granted marketing authorization, including line extensions of such new medicines within five years of the
marking authorization. However, this freedom was limited by an expectation that pricing would be “close”
to value assessments for new medicines provided by the National Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence (now called the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence), an executive non
departmental Government body.

- All other pricing, including price increases or variations, are subject to Governmental consent. There were
flexible pricing options or special rules for defined scenarios (such as new indications), but the Government
generally had discretion as to what was accepted.

Therefore, under the PPRS, although the technical position is freedom of pricing at launch, there were notable
constraints on individual product pricing and the profit/repayment mechanisms influence PPRS members’ pricing
across their portfolios. The PPRS was not a reimbursement scheme as such, but rather a system to control the
profitability of persons placing branded medicinal products on the market.

The Government does not use external reference pricing for medicines, but United Kingdom prices are often used
as reference pricing elsewhere and the above factors will be relevant where that is the case.

The PPRS expired on December 31, 2018. In a November 23, 2018 announcement, the Government and the
Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry confirmed that the replacement will be called the 2019
Voluntary Scheme for Branded Medicines Pricing and Access (and known as “the Voluntary Scheme” for short).
It is believed that the full final contents of the Voluntary Scheme will be published during December 2018. Based
on preliminary indications to industry, there is as yet no reason to expect significant divergence from the current
PPRS on the above points, but that is dependent on last minute negotiation and potential changes to the announced
position.

_The Statutory Scheme_

Suppliers of branded medicines that elected not to be subject to the PPRS or which were required to leave the
PPRS by virtue of a notice served by the Secretary of State are subject to a statutory scheme for sales to the United
Kingdom NHS. The statutory scheme in force since April 1, 2018 replaced a system involving a mandatory 15%
price cut on the United Kingdom NHS list price of medicines on sale on December 1, 2013 with the following
two forms of price regulations:

- a repayment mechanism based on a percentage of suppliers’ net sales income (which is initially 7.8% and
which is expected to be 9.9% for 2019) and modelled on that currently applicable under the PPRS; and

- a mechanism for the setting of maximum prices that may be charged by a manufacturer or supplier,

unless in either case the medicines were procured under a contract subject to public procurement legislation
entered into on or before April 1, 2018 and/or entered into following a tender that closed on or before that date
(including call off contracts under a framework agreement entered into on or before that date, even if the call off
itself is entered into after that date).

The Government has recently consulted on amendments to the statutory scheme rules and is expected to make
amendments to the statutory scheme.

_Unbranded Generics_

In principle, there is freedom of pricing for unbranded generic prescription only pharmaceuticals, which are
subject to competition on the open market. However, the following two factors may influence prices charged by
generic suppliers:

272


-----

- The price at which pharmacists are reimbursed for dispensing prescription generics is set by the “Drug
Tariff,” Part VIIIA of which lists reimbursement prices for the vast majority of generic prescription
pharmaceuticals. Different methods for calculating reimbursement pricing have been applied to different
categories of generics. However, the Health Service Products (Provision and Disclosure of Information)
Regulations 2018 introduced mandatory information retention, and mandatory information provision on
request, in relation to sales and income provision by all suppliers of unbranded generics to facilitate Drug
Tariff pricing. Although some provisions of these June 2018 Regulations came into force in January 2019,
the provisions relating to information on unbranded generics are already in force.

- Section 262 of the National Health Service Act 2006 (as amended in 2017 by the Health Service Medical
Supplies Costs Act 2017) grants the Government power to limit any price charged by the supplier of any
medicine to the United Kingdom NHS where that medicine is not covered by a voluntary scheme. This
would in theory apply to (i) branded medicines subject to the statutory scheme, (ii) unbranded generics, (iii)
OTC medicines dispensed under a prescription unless caught by the PPRS (see “—OTC Sales” below) or
(iv) a medicine sold OTC to the United Kingdom NHS. However, any enforcement under s262 requires a
proactive step by the Government and consultation with a relevant industry body (such as a trade
association).

_OTC Sales_

The only potential pricing constraint on the sale of products that are actually sold OTC is s262 of the National
Health Service Act 2006 (see “—Unbranded Generics” above), and then only for OTC sales to the United
Kingdom NHS. Otherwise, the sale of products OTC is free on the open market.

Where OTC medicines are prescribed on the United Kingdom NHS, two features may influence a supplier’s
pricing:

- The cost of purchasing and dispensing an OTC medicine prescribed on the United Kingdom NHS is in
principle reimbursable to community pharmacies, unless it features on a “black list” of nonreimbursable
products that forms part of the Drug Tariff.

- Where an OTC medicine’s prescription sales are below £50,000, the Government may exercise discretion
to exclude such sales from PPRS calculations relevant to the profit cap and the industry repayment. A PPRS
member company should therefore note that any sales of prescribed OTC products will count towards such
calculations, where the Government has not exercised this discretion.

For non PPRS members, the Government has confirmed that OTC sales (including where OTC products are
prescribed) are not subject to the statutory scheme.

**_Reimbursement of Medicinal Products in Italy_**

In order to be placed on the market, medicinal products must be priced and assigned (by AIFA, the Italian
Medicines Agency) to a class (i.e., classes A, H, C and C bis). These classes are used to identify whether or not
the cost of a medicinal product is charged to the Italian NHS. The costs of medical products assigned to classes A
and H are wholly borne by the Italian NHS (i.e., reimbursable); some of them are refundable only in hospitals. By
contrast, the patient has to bear the costs for medicinal products in classes C and C bis (i.e., non-reimbursable).
The class of refundability is identified during the marketing authorization procedure.

Class A includes essential products and those intended for chronic diseases (e.g., antibiotics, antidiabetic and
antitumor medicines), and are fully reimbursed by the Italian NHS. To acquire these products, a valid prescription
must be obtained.

Class H includes products requiring specialist supervision that are fully reimbursed by the Italian NHS if dispensed
in hospitals.

Class C includes other products that do not have the characteristics of class A or class H and are not reimbursed
by the Italian NHS. In particular, they are medicinal products used for minor diseases, which are therefore not
considered to be “essential” or “lifesaving.” Class C includes prescription only medicinal products as well as
nonprescription only medicinal products which cannot be advertised to the public. With Law 311/2004 (Budget
Law 2005), a new range of medicinal products was established, the C bis class, which includes nonprescription
only medicinal products which may be advertised to the public (OTC products).

273


-----

The mechanism for determining the prices of medicinal products differs depending on whether they are
reimbursable or not. In particular, AIFA applies price regulation only to reimbursed medicines. For nonreimbursable medicines (class C), the price is set freely by pharmaceutical companies but is monitored by AIFA
and the Ministry of Health in order to keep prices at reasonable levels. Although, in principle, the prices of class
C medicinal products are set freely by pharmaceutical companies, in practice they have been increasingly
regulated by legislative provisions according to which pharmaceutical companies may only increase prices of
class C pharmaceuticals every other January. The prices assigned by manufacturers are maximum prices
nationwide. Price reductions by manufacturers are allowed at any time, while price increases are allowed in
January of odd years. With reference to classes C and C bis medicinal products, however:

(i) as to medicinal products that are subject to medical prescription, AIFA carries out monitoring action aimed
at verifying compliance with two main conditions: (i) that the price of medicinal products can be increased
every two years (in odd years); and (ii) that the increase may not exceed the target inflation rate; and

(ii) as to medicinal products that are not subject to medical prescription, the price is freely determined by
manufacturers.

With reference to classes A and H medicinal products, a specific negotiation procedure between AIFA and
pharmaceutical companies holding marketing authorizations is provided for in the applicable legislation in order
to determine the price of the relevant medicinal products. The negotiation procedure is conducted according to
the following criteria: therapeutic value, pharmacovigilance data, prices in other European Union countries, prices
of similar products within the same pharmaceutical therapeutic group, internal market forecasts, the number of
potential patients and therapeutic innovation. In order to determine the price of medicinal products, the negotiation
between AIFA and pharmaceutical companies requires completion of a four stage procedure:

(iii) Pharmaceutical companies file with AIFA a specific reimbursement and pricing request supported by a
dossier aimed at proving: (a) a positive cost/benefit ratio (which means that the medicinal product (x) is to
be considered useful for the treatment of diseases for which there is no effective treatment, or provides a
more appropriate response in respect of products already available for the same therapeutic indications; or
(y) presents a more favorable risk/benefit ratio if compared with other medicinal products already
available); or (b) other elements of interest for the NHS, if the medicinal product does not present a
significant clinical superiority compared with to other products already available or that it is at least as
effective and safer that other products already available.

(iv) AIFA’s Technical Scientific Committee (“CTS”) provides its opinion on reimbursement by an evaluation
of the clinical therapeutic value.

(v) AIFA’s Pricing and Reimbursement Committee evaluates the dossier, also taking into consideration the
consumer spending data provided by the National Observatory on the Use of Medicines (OSMED), and
hears from the company as part of the negotiation.

(vi) The outcome of the negotiation is submitted to the CTS for its final opinion and then to AIFA’s
Management Board for approval.

The results of the negotiation procedure are published in the Italian Official Gazette. A price agreement reached
between AIFA and the manufacturer of the medicinal product lasts 24 months and is subject to automatic renewal
for an additional period of 24 months unless previously terminated by either party. In the event of changes in the
therapeutic indications of a medicinal product leading to a potential increase in its use, the negotiation must be reopened before the expiration of the agreement. It is common practice to establish a proportionate relationship
between the price paid and the volume of sales of the medicinal product under the negotiation procedure. If there
is no agreement on the price, then the medicinal product is classified as not reimbursable and listed in class C.

As a general principle, the price of medicinal products, which includes VAT (applied at a rate of 10%), includes
the ex-factory value (which is the price of industry revenue) and the amounts due to wholesalers and pharmacists.
The pricing negotiation procedure for generics does not differ from that of other medicines, although, based on
applicable regulations, the manufacturer should guarantee at least a 20% price reduction below the price of the
originator reference medicinal product.

The Italian NHS only reimburses classes A and H medicinal products; no reimbursement is provided for class C
medicinal products.

274


-----

In Italy, an RPS—which is one of the instruments used to control public expenditure on pharmaceutical products—
has been in effect since 2001.

Under the RPS, the Italian NHS reimburses the lowest price among the prices of off patent medicinal products
made with equal composition in active ingredients, with the same pharmaceutical form, the same method of
administration, the same number of units and the same unit dosage. When patients refuse the substitution of a
medicine eligible for generic substitution and/or if the doctor prescribes a pharmaceutical product with a price
higher than the reference price and specifically provides that the said pharmaceutical product cannot be substituted
with other products, the difference is paid by the patient.

In Italy, medicinal products are traditionally distributed by pharmacies. Exceptions include a few widely used or
very expensive products, which are distributed directly by the Local Health Authorities (“LHAs”) and by hospitals.
Drug reimbursement is made by the LHAs to the pharmacies. Once a medicinal product is authorized, it is not
immediately eligible for reimbursement. As a very general principle, reimbursement is provided for essential
medicinal products, namely products: (i) for diseases for which no therapeutic alternative exists; (ii) for which the
medicinal products already available on the market do not provide a satisfactory or appropriate answer; and (iii)
which present a better cost/benefit and risk/benefit analysis than those offered by medicinal products already on
the market. Even in the absence of these characteristics, medicinal products that are as safe and effective as those
already on the market may be reimbursable depending on the result of their cost/benefit evaluation.

When evaluating eligibility for reimbursement, AIFA also takes into consideration the following factors in relation
to the medicinal products: the sales price in other European Union member states; the therapeutic class; the
foreseen market share in the following 24 months; the impact on expenditures for the Italian NHS; and its place
in the industrial environment. To apply for reimbursement, the marketing authorization holder must submit an
application alongside documentation proving, among other things, a positive cost/benefit ratio to demonstrate that
the medicinal products is to be considered useful for the treatment of diseases for which there is no medical care,
or that it provides more adequate treatment compared to other medicinal products already on the market.

Finally, please note that the procedural rules illustrated above and the criteria for the negotiation of the
refundability and price of medicinal products by the Italian NHS, between AIFA and the pharmaceutical
companies, has been slightly changed in the last year due to new decree and guidelines on new procedures for
negotiating the refundability and price of medicinal products. More precisely, following the revision in pricing
and reimbursement (“P&R”) negotiation procedures, formalized as legislation in July 2020, new AIFA guidelines
for submission of a P&R dossier took effect from 1 March 2021. As of May 2021, dossiers can be submitted
online. Besides requiring the disclosure of pricing information, the rules place increased weight on added
therapeutic value, which is expected to have a negative impact on innovative drug prices. The selection of an
appropriate comparator is seen as the greatest challenge by manufacturers, particularly for orphan drugs where
there are few or no alternative treatments. The establishment of a simplified P&R procedure for generics and
biosimilars will place further pressure on the prices of off-patent molecules whilst boosting generics uptake. As
of the date of this Exchange Offer Memorandum this does not, however, mean that completely new regulations
have been introduced, but only that some of the existing rules regarding the pricing and reimbursement (P&R)
negotiation procedures and relevant dossier concerning the refundability and price of medicinal products marketed
in Italy, have got some amendments and new requirements to be fulfilled to get reimbursement.

**_Reimbursement of Medicinal Products in Spain_**

Public reimbursement of medicinal products is tightly regulated by Spanish legislation under the equality principle
within the whole Health National System (the “HNS”) and only applies to those prescription medicinal products
(prescribed by pharmacies, hospitals or healthcare centers) that have been previously included in the HNS through
a specific authorization granted by the state authorities. Medicines covered by the HNS do not include OTC
medicines, but do include some generics prescription. All medicines not included in the HNS can be priced freely
on the open market, subject to a notification issued to the State Authorities.

State authorities (i.e., the Health Ministry) approve the prices and reimbursement conditions for the authorized
medicinal prescription products that apply all over the territory mainly taking into account the characteristics of
the pathologies involved, public expenditure rationalization, the impact on the public budget, a cost effectiveness
analysis and the existence of similar medicinal products. Generally, the maximum reimbursement price (the
“Industry Price”) will be equal to or below the price that would apply if the corresponding medicinal products
were dispensed to patients who are not beneficiaries of the HNS. To settle the Industry Price, the pharmaceutical
industry is obligated to provide to the state authorities all the information on technical, financial and economic
matters related to the relevant medicinal product.

275


-----

Public reimbursement is subject to the RPS, which is the maximum amount that the corresponding prescribed
medicinal product included in each medicinal group (with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient and route of
administration) will be public reimbursed, i.e., the RPS is a product group pricing benchmark that will influence
the Industry Price for an individual product where the relevant product group has previously been allocated a
reference price. The RPS is set by taking into account the lowest cost/treatment/length of treatment of the
medicinal products of each group. The retail price is based on the RPS, adding wholesale and pharmacy
commercial margins, respectively, which are tightly regulated by the state authorities.

The Industry Price of a particular medicinal product represents the maximum price at which an HNS medicine
will be reimbursed at the manufacturing level. The marketing authorization holder who will deliver into the supply
chain (typically, to a wholesaler who will sell it on to a pharmacy) will therefore be aware of the maximum price
that it will collect. Wholesaler and pharmacy margins are be fixed by legislation. The retail price equals the
Industry Price plus the wholesale and pharmacy commercial margins. Once the Industry Price is fixed, it is be
updated annually by the state authorities and can be modified if changes in financial and technical circumstances
or the evaluation of their therapeutic use so warrants.

State authorities are entitled to proceed with the necessary inspections in order to verify if the maximum prices
are being adhered to, and if they are not, state authorities can initiate penalty proceedings that may lead to the
imposition of fines and the seizure of the medicinal products affected in the case of a breach. Pricing set in other
jurisdictions cannot replace the equivalent price in Spain without a particular resolution issued by the state
authorities which establishes the price, which can be equal to or different from the price of other jurisdictions.

**_Reimbursement of Medicinal Products in Russia_**

In Russia, there are two types of reimbursement schemes:

(1) _For all in patients and emergency care (under the Federal Fund for Mandatory Medical Insurance). This_
scheme covers all pharmaceutical products that a patient receives in a hospital (e.g., prescription only
medicines and any OTC medicines). The pharmaceutical products must be included in a standard of care
developed by the Ministry of Health for the particular disorder and in the VEP list, a list of drugs which
should be made available in an in-patient setting, and which is used as the basis for a number of out-patient
reimbursement schemes (See “Regulation—Russia—Overview—VEP Circulation”). In the case of an
individual patient not responding to treatment with a VEP medicine or having an adverse reaction to a
VEP, the medical panel may substitute a non VEP medicine.

(2) _For out-patients. The out-patient reimbursement schemes include: (a) the ONLS (Population Drug_
Coverage) scheme covering eligible categories of patients; (b) the VZN scheme (also referred to as the
“High cost nosologies” scheme) covering patients with high cost diseases, including mucoviscidosis and
multiple sclerosis, which are together referred to as the DLO scheme; and (c) other schemes also covering
certain groups of patients (e.g., patients suffering from orphan diseases, children under three years of age
and others).

Depending on their entitlement, out-patients are eligible to receive either free or partially subsidized prescription
medicines. In order to receive benefits, some patients (e.g., veterans and disabled persons) are required to present
authorization documents confirming their status and can obtain a wide range of drugs for different disorders. Other
patients must be included in the federal register for specified disorders and can only obtain the medicines that are
included in the list of the drugs relevant to their disorder. A prescription is issued by a consulting physician. An
out-patient can obtain necessary drugs in authorized (state or municipal) drugstores.

The general rules of VEP pricing are described under “—Russia—Overview—VEP Circulation.” A VEP drugs
manufacturer can apply annually to re-register (to increase) a price under the rules set by the government to recover
the manufacturer’s operating costs. Distributors and drugstores can each apply a markup that is limited by regional
legislatures. Federal and regional authorities have the right to control retail prices and pricing during procurement
procedures.

All reimbursable pharmaceutical products are purchased by hospitals and authorized drugstores solely through
public procurement procedures which tender for drugs by reference to their INN (taking into account the dosage,
dosage form and other significant features of medicinal products), their compliance with the registered price with
respect to VEP (overpricing is prohibited in the case of VEP subject of public procurement) and which give
priority to medicinal products from EAEU countries in an auction. Non VEP product pricing is not regulated by
the state. If the products subject to public procurement procedures are not VEP, the initial maximum contract price

276


-----

in the context of public procurement procedures is defined using the current market price. The Order of the
Ministry of Health “On the Approval of the Public Pharmacare Strategy in the Russian Federation till 2025 and
its Implementation Schedule” sets forth a new reimbursement system in Russia, to be implemented in the future.
Pilot projects have been introduced in selected regions. For example, in the Kirov region, the project "drug
reimbursement" is being implemented, in which patients who have suffered some acute cardiovascular diseases
(heart attack, heart surgery) are provided with medicines free of charge for 2 years. Also, patients with other nonacute cardiovascular diseases purchase drugs in pharmacies at a discount of 60% (for Russian drugs) or 50% (for
imported drugs). There are many program proposals for reimbursement schemes, including those presented at the
State Council in December 2019, but due to coronavirus infection, many discussions have been suspended. The
law on introduction of the Unified Patient Register was adopted in July 2020. There is an initiative on creation of
a Unified Pharmacy Department, which will accumulate all state procurements for benefit-entitled citizens
(currently it exists on federal and regional levels). Both mentioned initiatives will ensure the transparency of
tracking the movement of pharmaceuticals for benefit-entitled citizens. Several other reimbursement models are
under consideration, including the introduction of a reference pricing system of interchangeable drugs under
which patients, if they choose, will be required to pay any difference between the reference price of the generic
version and the actual price of the desired original product.

secured net leverage ratio (as described in the Senior Secured Notes Indentures) does not exceed 5.00:1; or (ii) if
the indebtedness does not fall within paragraph (i), the fixed charge coverage ratio does not exceed 2.00:1, and in

**_Mandatory Prepayment_**

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement requires mandatory prepayment in full or in part in certain
circumstances, including:

- on an initial public offering which does not constitute a change of control (with the percentage of proceeds
to be prepaid subject to the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio) (a “Listing Prepayment”);

- from certain net cash proceeds received by the Senior Secured Group from certain asset disposals, to the
extent not otherwise applied for a permitted purpose and required to be applied in prepayment of the Senior
Credit Facilities and subject to a de minimis amount; and

- unless otherwise agreed by the majority lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, for
each financial year (commencing with the first full financial year following the Closing Date), a percentage
of excess cash flow in the event that excess cash flow exceeds a minimum threshold amount (subject to
certain adjustments based on anticipated debt service, distributions to be paid to non-controlling
shareholders and certain other expenses), which percentage decreases as the Senior Secured Net Leverage
Ratio decreases (an “Excess Cash Flow Prepayment”).

Upon the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement), each
lender shall be entitled to require prepayment of its commitments within a prescribed time period. A change of
control shall include:

- any person or group becoming the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the voting power of the Issuer
other than in connection with a transaction or series of transactions in which the Issuer shall become the
wholly owned subsidiary of a parent entity (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement)
subject to certain conditions;

- the Senior Notes Issuer ceasing to directly own 100% of the total issued share capital of the Issuer (or any
successor entity as a result of certain mergers);

- prior to certain potential mergers of STADA permitted by the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement,
the Issuer or German Holdco ceasing to (directly or indirectly) own a percentage of the issued share capital
of STADA (excluding treasury shares) at least equal to 60% of such total issued share capital;

- following certain potential mergers of STADA permitted by the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreement, the Issuer ceasing to (directly or indirectly) own a percentage of the issued share capital of
German Holdco at least equal to 60% of such total issued share capital; and

- on a disposal of all or substantially all of the assets of the Senior Secured Group (as defined below).

At the election of the Issuer, amounts required to be prepaid pursuant to a Listing Prepayment or an Excess Cash
Flow Prepayment may instead be applied in repayment of any other indebtedness of the Senior Secured Group
ranking pari passu with Facility F.

Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the section entitled “Description of the New Notes”) and members of the
Senior Secured Group that are Material Subsidiaries (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities

Agreement), are guarantors under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement on the date when the annual
financial statements of the Issuer are required to be delivered to the agent under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement.

The provision and the terms of the security and guarantees set forth above will in all cases be subject to certain
limitations and are at all times and in all cases subject to the requirements of applicable law and the other matters
set forth in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement.

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement contains certain of the incurrence covenants, information
undertakings and related definitions (with, in each case, certain adjustments), including (i) limitations on
indebtedness, (ii) limitations on restricted payments, (iii) limitations on liens (which includes a restriction on
designating certain credit facilities and/or hedging obligations secured on the Senior Notes Collateral as Super
Senior Liabilities (as defined in the section entitled “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement”) unless, prior to such designation, Facility F has been refinanced in full (ignoring any_

respect of which a lender has declined prepayment)), (iv) limitation on restrictions on distributions from restricted
subsidiaries, (v) limitations on sale of assets and subsidiary stock, (vi) limitations on affiliate transactions, (vii)
merger and consolidation, (viii) suspension of covenants on achievement of investment grade status, (ix)
additional guarantees and intercreditor agreements, (x) no impairment of security interests and (xi) designation of
restricted and unrestricted subsidiaries.

In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement also requires the Issuer and certain of its restricted
subsidiaries to observe certain other customary positive and negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions and
grace periods, including covenants relating to: (i) authorizations and consents; (ii) compliance with laws; (iii) pari
_passu ranking; (iv) insurances; (v) payment of taxes; (vi) pension schemes; (vii) compliance with certain_

Solely for the benefit of the lenders participating in the Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities Agreement requires that, in the event that the aggregate amount of all cash loans drawn under the
Revolving Credit Facility (excluding any utilizations by way of letters of credit (or bank guarantees) or ancillary
facilities or any amounts utilized to fund any agreed fees in connection with the syndication of certain of the
Senior Credit Facilities) exceeds 35% of the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility on the relevant
testing date or, if higher, the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility as at the original date of the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement (the “Revolving Test Condition”), the Senior Secured Net Leverage
Ratio does not exceed 8.75 to 1.00. The Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio is based on the definitions and
adjustments in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, which may differ from similar definitions in the
Senior Secured Notes Indentures and the equivalent definitions described in this Exchange Offer Memorandum.

the Issuer to make shareholder injections by way of debt and/or equity to the Issuer to (i) increase the consolidated
pro forma EBITDA under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, (ii) decrease consolidated senior
secured net debt as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement, or (iii) prepay the Revolving Credit
Facility so that the Revolving Test Condition is no longer satisfied. The equity cure right may not be exercised on
more than five occasions during the term of the Senior Credit Facilities and may not be utilized in consecutive
financial quarters.

It is intended that certain agreed covenants and other provisions of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement
will fall away on the satisfaction of certain release conditions, being (i) the occurrence of a listing in respect of
which the Senior Secured Group’s ratio of consolidated total net debt to consolidated pro forma EBITDA does
not exceed an agreed ratio; (ii) the Issuer having a long term corporate credit rating equal to or better than Baa3
according to Moody’s Investor Services Limited or BBB according to Standard & Poor’s Rating Services; or (iii)
Facility F has achieved and maintained investment grade status.

**_Events of Default_**

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement provides for substantially the same events of default as under the
New Notes. In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement provides for additional events of default,
subject to customary materiality qualifications and grace periods, including (i) breach of the financial covenant,
provided that, in the event of such breach, only a majority of the Lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility shall
initially be entitled to take enforcement action; (ii) inaccuracy of a representation or statement when made; (iii)
invalidity and unlawfulness of the Senior Credit Facilities financing documents; and (iv) material failure to comply
with the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Governing Law_**

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in
connection with it, are governed by, construed in accordance with and will be enforced in accordance with English
law although the information undertakings, restrictive covenants, events of default and related definitions
scheduled to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with New York law
(without prejudice to the fact that the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement is governed by English law).

**_Senior Term Facilities Amendment and Repricing_**

In February 2020, the Issuer completed (i) a full cashless refinancing of Facility B1 (EUR), Facility B2, Facility
C (EUR), Facility C (GBP) and Facility D (the “Senior Term Facilities Amendment”), (ii) an amendment of
Facility E (the “Facility E2 Amendment”) and (ii) a repricing of Facility D (the “Facility D Repricing”) (together
the “Repricing Transactions”). On February 6, 2020, the Issuer entered into additional facility notices in respect
of Facility F (EUR) and Facility F (GBP), and on February 12, 2020, the Issuer entered into an amendment and
restatement agreement in respect of Facility E, pursuant to which the Senior Term Facilities Amendment, the
Facility E2 Amendment and the Facility D Repricing took effect. Facility F (EUR) and Facility F (GBP) were
established on substantially the same terms as Facility C (EUR) and Facility C (GBP) save for, subject to certain
conditions, the termination date was extended up to August 2026 (with a springing maturity to June 2025 in case
the Senior Notes remain outstanding at that date at their current maturity, or to the extent that the maturity of the
Senior Notes is extended to a date between September 2025 and August 2026, as would fall three months prior to
such new maturity date) and, in respect of Facility D only, save as to the proposed decrease in margin. The Facility
E2 Amendment amended and restated Facility E as “Facility E2”, in order to give effect to the same amendment
regarding termination date as Facility F (EUR) and Facility F (GBP) gave effect to. Facility B1 (EUR), Facility
B2, Facility C (EUR), Facility C (GBP) and Facility D were refinanced in full on a cashless basis from the proceeds
of Facility F (EUR) and Facility F (GBP) (as applicable in respect of currency), and all outstanding commitments
in respect of Facility B1 (EUR), Facility B2, Facility C (EUR), Facility C (GBP) and Facility D were cancelled.
With effect from the first interest period for Facility E2 to commence after 3 September 2020, all of the
commitments under Facility E2 were automatically reallocated to, on a cashless basis and by book entry, and
consolidated into Facility F (EUR) (the “Facility E2 Reallocation”). In September 2021, the Issuer completed (i)
a commitment upsize in amount of €295,000,000 in respect of Facility F (EUR) and (ii) a commitment upsize in
amount of £50,000,000 in respect of Facility F (GBP) ((i) and (ii) together the “Upsize Transaction”). Following
the Repricing Transactions, the Facility E2 Reallocation and the Upsize Transaction, we have aggregate drawings
of (i) €2,660,000,000 under Facility F (EUR) and (ii) £316,000,000 under Facility F (GBP).

“Topco Shared Security” refers to security at any time which is created, or expressed to be created, over (a) each
of (i) the shares in the Issuer held by the Senior Notes Issuer and (ii) all receivables owed to the Senior Notes
Issuer by the Issuer (including any Topco Proceeds Loan and the Topco Proceeds Loan and the Topco Proceeds
Loan Liabilities, as applicable) and (b) to the extent not included in (a) above, (i) the shares in the Issuer held by
any direct shareholder of the Issuer, (ii) all receivables owed to a Topco Investor (as defined herein), Subordinated
Creditor or other Holding Company or shareholder of the Issuer by the Issuer (including any Topco Proceeds
Loan and the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities), (iii) the shares in any Topco Borrower which is a member of the
Senior Secured Group, (iv) all receivables owed by a member of the Senior Secured Group under any Topco
Proceeds Loan (or, in the case of a Topco Borrower which is a member of the Senior Secured Group, any Senior
Secured Notes Proceeds Loan), (v) any escrow account relating to the proceeds of any Topco Liabilities and (vi),
any other assets not falling within limbs (b)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) of this paragraph of a Topco Borrower which
is a member of the Senior Secured Group, in each case to the extent provided for by the Topco Finance Documents
at any time and designated as Topco Shared Security by the Issuer (in its discretion) in favor of the Security Agent
as agent or trustee for the other Secured Parties (or if such trustee arrangements are not legally possible, in favor
of all the Secured Parties or in favor of the Security Agent under a parallel debt or similar structure). Topco Shared
Security shall secure all liabilities and present and future obligations of each Topco Borrower that is not a member
of the Senior Secured Group and each of its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the documents governing the
relevant Topco Notes or Topco Facility (as the case may be)) (the “Topco Group”), each Debtor and each Thirdparty Security Provider to the Secured Parties under the Secured Debt Documents.

“Transaction Security” refers to security (from the Senior Secured Group, any Third-party Security Provider and
Topco Shared Security (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Topco Independent Transaction Security), as
defined below) which is created, or expressed to be created, in favor of the Security Agent as agent or trustee for
the other Secured Parties (or if such trustee arrangements are not legally possible, in favor of all the Secured
Parties or in favor of the Security Agent under a parallel debt or similar structure). Transaction Security which is
not Topco Shared Security shall secure all liabilities and present and future obligations of the Debtors and Thirdparty Security Providers to the Secured Parties (other than the creditors under the Topco Liabilities (the “Topco
_Secured Parties”)) under the Debt Documents (other than the finance documents relating to the Topco Liabilities_
(the “Topco Finance Documents”)).

The New Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee will be Senior Secured Notes Liabilities for the purposes
of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Notes and Senior Notes Guarantee will be Topco Notes Liabilities
for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement. On the Issue Date, no Second Lien Lender Liabilities, Second
Lien Notes Liabilities or Super Senior Liabilities will be outstanding. Such liabilities and liabilities in respect of
other new debt financings may only be incurred and/or designated if not prohibited under the terms of the Debt
Documents, including, without limitation, the covenants applicable to the Senior Notes described under
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants.” and the covenants applicable to the Senior
Secured Notes described in the Senior Secured Notes Indentures.

(b) any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance from any member of the Senior Secured Group in respect
of the Topco Liabilities in addition to any guarantee, indemnity or assurance in the original form of
any Topco Finance Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement, or given to all the Secured Parties as
security for the liabilities of the Topco Group, each Debtor and any Third-party Security Provider to

**_New Debt Financing_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to certain conditions, for the implementation of existing, additional,
supplemental or new financing arrangements that will constitute, for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement,
Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities, Hedging
Liabilities (and after the Designation Date (i) Super Senior Hedging Liabilities (as defined herein) and (ii) Hedging
Liabilities other than Super Senior Hedging Liabilities (the “Pari passu _Hedging Liabilities” and the_
counterparties of which are referred to as “Pari passu _Hedge Counterparties”)), Second Lien Liabilities, Topco_
Liabilities or Super Senior Liabilities (each a “New Debt Financing”). The conditions include certification by the
Issuer that such New Debt Financing is not prohibited under the terms of the Finance Documents.

Such financing arrangements may be implemented by way of refinancing, replacement, exchange, set off,
discharge or increase of any such new, existing, additional, supplemental or new financing arrangement under the
relevant finance documents. In connection with and in order to facilitate any New Debt Financing, each agent in
respect of any Priority Secured Liabilities (as defined herein) and the Security Agent (and each other person party
to a Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document) is authorized and
instructed to enter promptly into any new security document, amend or waive any term of an existing security
document and/or release any asset from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as
the case may be) subject to certain conditions, including as regards the terms of such security (which shall be,
unless otherwise agreed by the Issuer or otherwise required by the Issuer to the extent that the existing Transaction
Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is not being amended or released and the new Transaction
Security or new Topco Independent Transaction Security only secures the New Debt Financing, substantially the
same as the terms applicable to the existing Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security over
equivalent assets).

Where any indebtedness (“Permitted Acquired Indebtedness”) which is not prohibited under the Finance
Documents is incurred by or in connection with the acquisition of (i) a person or any of its subsidiaries who, after
the Closing Date, becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or merges, consolidates or is otherwise combined with a
Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) in relation to an asset of any such person or which is otherwise acquired after the
Closing Date ((i) and (ii) together an “Acquired Person or Asset”), any security, guarantee, indemnity or other
assurance against loss in respect of such New Debt Financing which is subsisting at the date when the conditions
to the incurrence of such New Debt Financing set out in the Intercreditor Agreement have been satisfied (or is to
be granted thereafter, including subject to any condition or periodic testing) shall be permitted to subsist and there
is no requirement to offer that security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance in respect of any other liabilities
under any Debt Document. No security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is required to be
given by any member of the Topco Group in respect of any liabilities (including under any Debt Document) (i)
over any Acquired Person or Asset if this would breach a contractual undertaking applicable to the Topco Group
or is excluded or exempt from being given under the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement), (ii) over any asset required (including subject to any condition) to provide credit support
in relation to any Permitted Acquired Indebtedness (other than as a result of any obligation to extend any
Transaction Security ratably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness), or (iii) where the grant of
such security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is prevented by the documentation relation to
such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness or would give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation but
not including any obligation to extend any Transaction Security ratably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired
Indebtedness) under or in relation thereto.

**_Permitted Payments_**

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Senior and Super Senior Debt_

The Debtors and Third-party Security Providers may make payment in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities,
Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Super Senior Lender Liabilities and Cash Management Facility Liabilities
(together with the Hedging Liabilities, the “Senior Secured Creditor Liabilities,” the creditors in respect thereof
being the “Senior Secured Creditors”) at any time, provided that following certain Acceleration Events (as defined
in the Intercreditor Agreement) under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement any Permitted Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement or Senior Secured Notes Indentures or Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement
or following certain insolvency events in relation to a member of the Senior Secured Group, payments may only
be made by Debtors or Third-party Security Providers and received by creditors in accordance with the provisions
described below under “—Application of Proceeds” provided that after the Designation Date there shall be no
obligation to turnover any such payments received, other than those related to an enforcement of Transaction
Security or a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) of assets subject to the Transaction Security.

295


-----

Any failure to make a payment in accordance with the Senior Secured Finance Documents following an
Acceleration Event (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) as required by the Intercreditor Agreement shall
not prevent the occurrence of an event of default under such applicable Senior Secured Finance Documents.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Second Lien Debt_

Prior to the later of (i) the Super Senior Discharge Date (as defined below) and (ii) the first date on which all of
the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities (together, the “Senior
_Secured Liabilities” and together with the Second Lien Liabilities and Topco Liabilities being the “Secured_
_Liabilities”) have been discharged (the “Senior Secured Discharge Date”), the Debtors may only make specified_
scheduled payments in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities, in accordance with the finance documents governing
such Second Lien Liabilities, subject to compliance with certain conditions in the Intercreditor Agreement.

The principal conditions are that the relevant payment (if it is a payment of principal or capitalized interest) is not
prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreement, including any Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement, Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and any Senior Secured Notes Indentures (or if it is
so prohibited, that all necessary consents have been obtained to permit it), no payment stop notice (“Second Lien
_Payment Stop Notice”) has been issued to the agent or trustee for the relevant Second Lien Liabilities and no_
payment default (subject to a de minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than principal, interest or certain
fees) is continuing under any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement, Cash Management Facility document or Senior Secured Notes document. A Second Lien
Payment Stop Notice will cease to apply, at the latest (subject to other exceptions), 120 days after delivery of the
applicable Second Lien Payment Stop Notice and no Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the
Security Agent in reliance on a Senior Secured Event of Default (as defined below) more than 45 days after the
occurrence of the relevant event of default. No more than one Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may be served
(i) with respect to the same event or set of circumstances, or (ii) in any period of 360 days.

Certain specified payments in respect of Second Lien Liabilities are also permitted at all times, notwithstanding
that a payment stop notice is outstanding or such a payment default is continuing. These payments and basket
amounts are substantially similar to those referenced for Topco Liabilities in (ii) of the next paragraph.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of Topco Liabilities_

Prior to the date which is the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date (the “Second Lien
_Discharge Date”) on which all Second Lien Liabilities have been discharged (the “Priority Discharge Date”), the_
Issuer, Topco Borrowers, Third-party Security Providers and other members of the Senior Secured Group may
only make specified scheduled payments (including any other direct or indirect step, matter, action or dealing in
relation to any Topco Liabilities otherwise prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement) under the Topco
Liabilities or under any Topco Proceeds Loan (together the “Topco Group Liabilities”) to the Topco Creditors or
any holding company of the Issuer or other lender in respect of a Topco Proceeds Loan (in respect of the Topco
Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) (such payments, collectively, “Permitted Topco-payments”):

(i) if:

(A) no Topco-payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding;

(B) no payment default (subject to a de minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than principal,
interest or certain fees) has occurred and is continuing under any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Cash Management Facility
document or Senior Secured Notes document (a “Senior Secured Payment Default”), or under the
Second Lien Facilities or Second Lien Notes (a “Second Lien Payment Default”); and

(C) the payment is of (1) any amount of principal or capitalized interest in respect of the Topco Liabilities
which is not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreements (in respect of the Senior Secured
Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or any required consents to permit such payment have
been obtained, (2) any other amount which is not an amount of principal or capitalized interest (such
other amounts including all scheduled interest payments (including, if applicable, special interest (or
liquidated damages))) and default interest on the Topco Liabilities accrued and payable in cash in
accordance with the terms of the relevant Topco Finance Document (as at the date of the issue of the
same or as amended in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the other Debt
Documents), additional amounts payable as a result of the tax gross up provisions relating to Topco
Liabilities and amounts in respect of currency indemnities in any Topco Finance Document, (3)

Majority Super Senior Creditors and Majority Second Lien Creditors (each as defined below), or (4)
amounts due under any syndication strategy letter relating to the Topco Finance Documents;

(ii) if, notwithstanding that a Topco-payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding and/or (other than
in respect of paragraph (M) below) a Senior Secured Payment Default and/or a Second Lien Payment
Default has occurred and is continuing and (if the Topco Borrower is a guarantor or borrower under any
prior ranking debt facilities at such time, other than in respect of paragraph (K) below) irrespective of
whether any creditors under prior ranking debt facilities have accelerated their debt, the payment is not
prohibited to be made at such time by any prior ranking financing agreements (in respect of the Senior
Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or the payment is (without double counting any
equivalent applicable basket in any Debt Document, but whether or not permitted by the Debt Documents):
(A) of ongoing fees under any original fee letter relating to the Topco Finance Documents; (B) of
commercially reasonable advisory and professional fees for restructuring advice and valuations (including
legal advice and the advice of other appropriate financial and/or restructuring advisors) and a Topco

Documents); (F) of any other amount not exceeding €2,500,000 in any twelve month period; (G) of any
amount of the Topco Liabilities which would have been payable but for the issue of a Topco-payment Stop
Notice (which has since expired and no new Topco-payment Stop Notice is outstanding) which has been
capitalized and added to the principal amount of the Topco Liabilities or where that amount is outstanding
as a result of the accrual of cash interest payable in respect of the Topco Liabilities during such period or
any such amount described at (i)(C) above, provided that no such payment may be made if certain events
of default have occurred under the Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities or would occur as
a result of making such payment; (H) for as long as an event of default under the Senior Secured Liabilities,
Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Group Liabilities which is continuing, all or part of the Topco Liabilities
being released or otherwise discharged solely in consideration for the issues of shares in any holding
company of the Issuer (a “Debt for Equity Swap”) provided that no cash or cash equivalent payment is
made in respect of the Topco Liabilities, that it does not result in a Change of Control as defined in any
prior ranking finance agreement or Topco Finance Document and that any Liabilities owed by a member
of the Senior Secured Group to another member of the Senior Secured Group, to the Subordinated Creditors
or to any other holding company of the Issuer that arise as a result of any such Debt for Equity Swap are
subordinated to the Senior Secured Liabilities and Second Lien Liabilities pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Senior Secured Creditors and Second Lien Creditors are granted Transaction Security

Finance Documents; (K) if the payment is made by the Topco Borrower in respect of its obligations under
the Topco Finance Documents; and such payment is not directly or indirectly sourced from a member of

is a guarantor or borrower of any prior ranking debt facilities at such time and any such prior ranking debt
facility has been accelerated or an Insolvency Event has occurred; (L) if the payment is of a principal
amount of the Topco Liabilities and made in accordance with a provision in a Topco Finance Document
relating to prepayment upon illegality or in relation to the prepayment of a single lender in the event of a
tax gross up, increased costs or other indemnity becoming payable; and (M) if no Senior Secured Payment
Default or Second Lien Payment Default has occurred and is continuing the payment is a payment of
principal, interest or any other amounts made on or after the final maturity date of the relevant Topco
Liabilities (provided that such maturity date is no earlier than that contained in the original form of the
relevant Topco Finance Document as of the date of first issuance or borrowing (as the case may be)) of the
applicable Topco Liabilities; or

(iii) if the requisite Senior Secured Creditors, Super Senior Creditors and Second Lien Creditors give prior
consent to that payment being made.

297


-----

On or after the Priority Discharge Date, the Debtors, the Topco Borrowers and the Third-party Security Providers
may make payments in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities in accordance with the Topco Finance Documents
and the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable).

_Topco Liabilities Payment Block Provisions_

A Topco-payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding from the date on which, following the occurrence
of an event of default under any Senior Secured Liabilities (a “Senior Secured Event of Default”) or an event of
default under the Second Lien Liabilities (a “Second Lien Event of Default”), the Security Agent (acting on the
instructions of the requisite Super Senior Creditors, Senior Secured Creditors or Second Lien Creditors gave the
instructions for the relevant stop notice to be delivered) (a “Topco-payment Stop Notice”) to the agent under any
Topco Facility (the “Topco Agent”) and the trustee under any Topco Notes (the “Topco Notes Trustee”) advising
that the Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default is continuing and suspending payments
by the Senior Secured Group of the Topco Liabilities, until the first to occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Topco-payment Stop Notice;

(ii) the date on which a default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of the
relevant Topco Liabilities;

(iii) if a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) commences after delivery of that Topco-payment Stop
Notice, the date on which such standstill period expiries;

(iv) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default has been
remedied or waived;

(v) the date on which the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of whichever of the Super Senior Creditors,
Senior Secured Creditors or Second Lien Creditors gave the instructions for the relevant stop notice to be
delivered) delivers a notice to the Topco Borrower, the Topco Agent and the Topco Notes Trustee
cancelling the payment stop notice;

(vi) the Priority Discharge Date; and

(vii) the date on which the Topco Creditors take any enforcement action that is permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement (see “—Enforcement Regime—Permitted Topco Enforcement” below).

No Topco-payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Security Agent in reliance on a Senior Secured Event of
Default or a Second Lien Event of Default more than 45 days after the occurrence of the relevant event of default.
No more than one Topco-payment Stop Notice may be served (i) with respect to the same event or set of
circumstances or (ii) in any period of 360 days.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities as a result of the issue of a Topcopayment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default
shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in
relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities or (ii) the issue of an enforcement notice in respect of an event of
default under the finance documents documenting any Topco Group Liabilities (a “Topco Enforcement Notice”)
on behalf of the Topco Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Nothing in the Second Lien or Topco payment block provisions will release any Debtor from the liability to make
any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under the applicable Debt Documents
even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time. The accrual and capitalization of interest (if
any) in accordance with the applicable Debt Documents shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a payment
stop notice.

**_Cure of Payment Stop_**

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured
Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default, that Topco Payment Stop Notice ceases to be

298


-----

outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment
Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Debtor or Topco Borrower then promptly pays to the Topco Creditors or any party that has
acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a creditor under a Topco Proceeds Loan (the “Topco Investors”)
(in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) an amount equal to any payments which had
accrued under the Topco Finance Documents or the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable) and
which would have been Permitted Topco Payments but for that Topco Payment Stop Notice or Senior
Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default (as the case may be),

then any event of default which may have occurred under a Topco Finance Document or Topco Proceeds Loan
Agreement and any Topco Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that suspension of
payments shall be deemed waived without any further action being required on part of the Topco Creditors or
relevant Topco Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only).

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that if, at any time prior to the latest to occur
of the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Second Lien Discharge Date and the
first date on which all of the Topco Liabilities have been fully discharged (the “Topco Discharge Date”) (the
“Final Discharge Date”) any creditor (other than a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date)
receives or recovers from any Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third-party Security Provider:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors
under the Debt Documents other than any payment or distribution which is either (x) not prohibited under
the Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the provisions set out below under “—
_Application of Proceeds”;_

(ii) any amount by way of set-off (pursuant to the applicable terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) which does
not give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors under the Debt Documents
(I) after the occurrence of an Acceleration Event (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) or the
enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of such an Acceleration Event (as defined in
the Intercreditor Agreement) (a “Distress Event”), or (II) as a result of any other litigation or
proceedings against a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or any Third-party Security
Provider (other than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of a Distress
Event,

other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in accordance with the provisions set out below under
“—Application of Proceeds”; and in the case of Intra Group Liabilities, any amount received or recovered in
accordance with the provisions relating to Intra Group Liabilities in the Intercreditor Agreement (to the extent
permitted to be received or recovered notwithstanding that an Acceleration Event is continuing);

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”; or

(v) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities
owed by any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third-party Security Provider which is
not in accordance with the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds” and which is made
as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event (as defined below) in respect of that Debtor,
member of the Senior Secured Group or Third-party Security Provider,

that creditor will:

(vi) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an amount of that
receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received or recovered) on trust
for (or otherwise on behalf and for the account of) the Security Agent and promptly pay or distribute that

299


-----

amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
and (y) promptly pay or distribute an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery
exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement; and

(vii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount
equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement.

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time on or after the
Designation Date but prior to the Final Discharge Date, any Senior Secured Creditor receives or recovers from
any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third-party Security Provider (x) any proceeds from the
enforcement of security or from a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or following a Distress Event, any
proceeds arising from any of the charged property (collectively, “Enforcement Proceeds”) or (y) any other
amounts which should otherwise be received or recovered by the Security Agent except in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds.”

other period agreed between the Issuer and the Instructing Group (as defined below)), (ii) (in the case of any
application to appoint and administrator or commence, proceedings) which the Security Agent is satisfied (acting
on the instructions of the Instructing Group) will be withdrawn before it is heard or will be unsuccessful and (iii)
as permitted under any Senior Secured Credit Facility Agreement or in any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or a Second Lien Facility Agreement, or
otherwise not constituting a default.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party to the
Intercreditor Agreement entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of an Obligor, Material Subsidiary or
Third-party Security Provider (in the case of a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to
the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) shall direct the person responsible for the distribution
to pay that distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in
full. The Security Agent shall apply all such distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out under
“—Application of Proceeds” below.

To the extent that any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third-party Security Provider’s liabilities to
creditors are, with certain exceptions, discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise and in the case of a
Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the extent such amounts constitute Enforcement
Proceeds) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any creditor benefiting from such set-off shall pay an
amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent
for application in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in respect of
any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent that the
realization proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights under ancillary or cash management facilities, each creditor irrevocably
authorizes the Security Agent to take Enforcement Action (as defined below), make demands, collect and receive
distributions, file claims and take other actions necessary to make recovery after the occurrence of an Insolvency
Event in relation to an Obligor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third-party Security Provider. The
creditors agree to do all things the Security Agent reasonably requests in order to give effect to these provisions.

**_Security Enforcement Regime_**

_Enforcement of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security
or the Topco Independent Transaction Security (as applicable) unless instructed otherwise by an Instructing
Group, Majority Second Lien Creditors or Majority Topco Creditors (as applicable) otherwise as specified in the
provisions described below.

An “Instructing Group” means:

(a) if the Designation Date has not occurred:

(i) prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (as defined below);

(ii) on or after the Senior Secured Discharge Date but before the Priority Discharge Date, the Majority
Second Lien Creditors; and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, the Majority Topco
Creditors (as defined below); and

(b) at any time on or after the occurrence of the Designation Date and:

(i) prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date on which the Super Senior
Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the “Super Senior Discharge Date”), Senior
Secured Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors) representing more than 50% of the Senior
Secured Liabilities (other than the Super Senior Liabilities) (the “Majority Senior Secured
_Creditors”), and Super Senior Creditors representing more than 50% of the Super Senior Liabilities_
(the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) save that, in each case for instructions relating to
enforcement, it shall mean the group of Secured Creditors entitled to give instructions in accordance
with the enforcement regime described under “—Enforcement of Transaction Security Prior to the
_Designation Date” and “—Enforcement of Transaction Security on or After the Designation Date”_
below;

(ii) on or after the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date but
before the Priority Discharge Date, Second Lien Creditors representing more than 50% of the Second
Lien Liabilities (the “Majority Second Lien Creditors”); and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, Topco Creditors
representing more than 50% of the Topco Liabilities (the “Majority Topco Creditors”).

_Enforcement of Transaction Security Prior to the Designation Date_

Prior to the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security unless
instructed otherwise by (i) the Instructing Group, (ii) if, prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Instructing
Group has (A) given no instructions or has instructed the Security Agent neither to enforce or cease enforcing and
(B) not required any Debtor or Third-party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal (as defined below),
an agent or trustee under the Second Lien Liabilities (acting on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien
Creditors) where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement,
or (iii) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Instructing Group (or Majority Second Lien Creditors as
applicable) have (A) given no instructions or have instructed the Security Agent neither to enforce or cease
enforcing and (B) not required any Debtor or Third-party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, a
Topco Agent or the Topco Notes Trustee (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors) where the
rights of the Topco Creditors to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement.

Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms, the Instructing Group
or any other persons entitled to give instructions in accordance with the preceding paragraph may give or refrain
from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from enforcing, the Transaction Security as
they see fit. Notwithstanding the above paragraphs, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second Lien
Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions to enforce the Transaction
Security either gives such instruction or indicates any intention to give such instruction, then the Instructing Group

301


-----

may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as the Instructing Group sees fit
and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions received from the Instructing Group.

Unless (i) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event or (ii) the Instructing
Group or any agent of the creditors represented in the Instructing Group determines in good faith that to do so
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the
Transaction Security or the realization proceeds of any such enforcement, before giving any such instructions to
enforce the Transaction Security or take any other enforcement action the agent(s) of the creditors represented by
an Instructing Group will be required to consult with each other agent (provided that any agent in respect of Topco
Liabilities need only be consulted if such enforcement relates to Topco Shared Security) for a period of up to ten
Business Days or take any Enforcement Action (the “Consultation Period”) and the Instructing Group will only
be entitled to give the enforcement instructions described above or take any Enforcement Action after the expiry
of such Consultation Period.

_Enforcement of Transaction Security on or After the Designation Date_

On or after the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security unless
instructed otherwise in accordance with the provisions described in this paragraph. If the Transaction Security has
become enforceable, if either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors wish
to issue enforcement instructions they shall deliver a copy of those instructions (an “Initial Enforcement Notice”)
to the Security Agent and to the other agents, trustees and hedge counterparties.

The Security Agent will act in accordance with any instructions (provided they are consistent with the
Enforcement Principles (as defined below)) received from (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, (ii) if the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to
instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of the Initial Enforcement Notice or the Super Senior
Discharge Date has not occurred within six months of the Initial Enforcement Notice, the Majority Super Senior
Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iii) if an Insolvency Event (other than an
Insolvency Event directly caused by enforcement action taken at the request of a Super Senior Creditor) is
continuing, the Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iv) if the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct
the Security Agent to pursue and the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith that a delay could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the Transaction
Security or on the realization of proceeds and the Majority Super Senior Creditors deliver instructions before the
Security Agent has received any instructions from the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Majority Super
Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (v) if, prior to the later of the Senior Secured
Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super
Senior Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent (A) not to
enforce or cease enforcing or (B) required any Debtor or Third-party Security Provider to make a Distressed
Disposal, any agent or trustee in relation to the Second Lien Liabilities (the “Second Lien Agent”) (acting on the
instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors) where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have
arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (vi) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable)
have not given instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent (A) not to enforce or cease enforcing or (B)
required any Debtor or Third-party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal an agent or trustee under the
Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors).

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second Lien Creditors
or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions either give such instruction or indicate
any intention to give such instruction, then the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or Majority Super Senior
Creditors to the extent that such group is entitled to give enforcement instructions as described in the paragraph
above may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as they see fit and the
Security Agent shall act on such instructions.

“Enforcement Principles” means certain requirements as to the manner of enforcement, including that (i) to the
extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value, the method of enforcement chosen should
maximize the value realized from such enforcement, (ii) certain proceeds must be received in cash and (iii)
enforcement in relation to assets over €5,000,000 or shares if not carried out by way of a public auction or other
competitive sales process, shall (if the Security Agent is requested to do so by the Majority Super Senior Creditors
or Majority Senior Secured Creditors) benefit from a fairness opinion from an investment bank, firm of
accountants or Third-party financial adviser.

302


-----

_Enforcement—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms,
an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco
Creditors) may give or refrain giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the
Topco Independent Transaction Security as they see fit.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is being enforced in accordance with any
of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall enforce the relevant Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security in such manner (including, without limitation, the selection of any administrator of any
Debtor or Third-party Security Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent) as any persons entitled at any time
under the above provisions shall instruct it or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees
fit (which may include taking no-action).

No Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to enforce, any Transaction
Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security
Documents except through the Security Agent.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is held by a creditor other than the Security
Agent, then creditors may only enforce that Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security in
accordance with instructions given by instructing creditors in accordance with the paragraphs above.

**_Enforcement Regime_**

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Creditors_

_Topco Default”) is continuing;_

(ii) all agents or trustees in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, and

action in relation to such document or agreement;

(C) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset of any member of the

writing to the Security Agent, that the relevant disposal or other action is not prohibited as at the date of completion
of such release or, at the option of the Issuer, on the date that the definitive agreement for such disposal or similar

member of the Topco Group or a Debtor is a borrower, issuer or primary debtor under any Debt Document, such
person shall have the right to voluntarily prepay all Liabilities outstanding under any Debt Document.

**_Distressed Disposals_**

“Distressed Disposal” means a disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities issued by a member

any transferee of those liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a Secured Party for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to
dispose of all or part of those liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any
Debt Document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a Secured Creditor or Secured Party for the

(A) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those Intra Group Liabilities or liabilities to any
Debtor on behalf of the relevant Intra Group Lenders and Debtors to which those obligations are
owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(B) (provided the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is also a
Guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities or the Topco Liabilities) to

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as described
above) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under “—
_Application of Proceeds” below as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction_
Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities had not
occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the Security
Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market
conditions (although the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal
or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled to give
and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not authorized
to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities owed
to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities and any other Senior
Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of
credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements
acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) following that release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Topco Creditors are entitled to give, and
have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not authorized to
release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities owed to
any Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities
and any other Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case
of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the
subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) following that release.

Where borrowing liabilities in respect of any Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities, Senior Secured
Notes Proceeds Loan Liabilities, Topco Liabilities or Unsecured Liabilities would otherwise be released pursuant
to the Intercreditor Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing liabilities transferred to
a holding company of the Issuer, in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the
relevant Debtor or the Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor
or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so transfer those borrowing liabilities.

If before the Second Lien Discharge Date or the Topco Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal is being effected
such that the Second Lien Liabilities or the Topco Liabilities and Transaction Security over shares in a borrower
or issuer of, or over assets of a borrower or issuer of, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities will be released
pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, it is a further condition to the release that either:

(i) the Second Lien Agent, trustee of the Second Lien Notes, Topco Agent and Topco Notes Trustee (as
applicable) have approved the release; or

(ii) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of Second Lien Liabilities or Topco
Guarantor are sold:

(A) the proceeds of such sale or disposal are in cash (or substantially in cash) and/or other marketable
securities or, if the proceeds of such sale or disposal are not in cash (or substantially in cash) and/or
other marketable securities, a valuation opinion has been obtained in accordance with the provisions
set out below; and

(B) all claims of the Secured Parties (other than in relation to performance bonds, guarantees or similar
instruments issued by a Secured Creditor on behalf of a member of the Senior Secured Group)
against a member of the Senior Secured Group (if any), all of whose shares (other than any minority
interest not owned by members of the Senior Secured Group) are pledged in favor of the Priority
Secured Parties are sold or disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement Action, are unconditionally
released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale (and are not assumed by
the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all Transaction Security, Topco Independent Transaction
Security or other security in favor of the Secured Parties in respect of the assets that are sold or
disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such
sale, provided that in the event of a sale or disposal of any such claim (instead of a release or
discharge):

(iii) where the Senior Secured Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Senior Agent and any senior
secured notes trustee (i) determine, acting reasonably and in good faith, that the Senior Secured Creditors
will recover more than if such claim was released or discharged but nevertheless less than the outstanding
Senior Secured Liabilities, and (ii) serve a notice on the Security Agent notifying the Security Agent of the
same;

(iv) where the Second Lien Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Second Lien Agent and any second
lien notes trustee (i) determine acting reasonably and in good faith that the Priority Secured Parties
(collectively) will recover more than if such claim was released or discharged but nevertheless less than
the outstanding amount of the liabilities owed to the Priority Secured Parties (the “Priority Secured
_Liabilities”) and (ii) serve a notice on the Security Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same; and_

(v) where the Topco Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Topco Agent and the Topco Notes Trustee

the outstanding Priority Secured Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities (collectively) and (ii) serve a notice
on the Security Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same,

in which case the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such claim to such purchaser
(or an affiliate of such purchaser) and the consideration for such sale or transfer may be in the form of non-cash
consideration by way of the Senior Secured Creditors, Second Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors (whichever
constitutes the Instructing Group) bidding by an appropriate mechanic the Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien
Liabilities or Topco Liabilities (as applicable) such that the relevant liabilities would on completion be discharged
to the extent of an amount equal to the amount of the offer made by the relevant creditors; and

(A) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made:

###### (1) pursuant to a public auction or other competitive sale process run in accordance with the
advice of a reputable, independent investment bank, firm of accountants or third-party
professional firm with a view to obtaining the best price reasonably obtainable taking into
account all relevant circumstances and in which creditors under the Second Lien Liabilities
and Topco Liabilities are entitled to participate as prospective buyers and/or financiers; or

###### (2) where a reputable, independent investment bank, firm of accountants or third-party
professional firm which is regularly engaged in providing such valuations has delivered an
opinion (including an enterprise valuation) in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount
is fair from a financial point of view, taking into account all relevant circumstances including
the method of enforcement, provided that the liability of such investment bank, firm of
accountants or third-party professional firm in giving such opinion may be limited to the
amount of its fees in respect of such engagement.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that if, for any reason, any liabilities relating to Super Senior Liabilities,
Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities remain unpaid after the first date on which
certain types of Enforcement Action are taken (the “Enforcement Date”) and the resulting losses are not borne by
the creditors in any given specified class in the proportions which their respective exposures at the Enforcement
Date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the creditors in that specified class at the Enforcement Date, the
relevant class of creditors will make such payments amongst themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put
the relevant creditors in such a position that (after taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in
those proportions.

**_Required Consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended or waived
only with the consent of the Issuer, the agents and trustees for the Secured Parties, and the Security Agent,
provided that, to the extent that an amendment, waiver or consent only affects one class of creditors, and such
amendment, waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected materially or adversely to affect the interests of
the other classes of creditors, only written agreement from the agent or trustee acting on behalf of the affected
class shall be required (or in the case of the hedge counterparties, each affected hedge counterparty).

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates to, among
other matters, the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” above and the order of priority or
subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be made without the consent of (i) each of the agents

311


-----

or trustees (acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the Senior Liabilities, the Super
Senior Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities, (ii) each Cash Management Facility
Lender (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the rights
and obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not
materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors), (iii) each hedge
counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the
rights and obligations of such hedge counterparty under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially
adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors), and (iv) the Issuer.

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent instructed to consent by the requisite percentage of creditors it represents
or as otherwise authorized by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such instructions or authorizations
in accordance therewith (save to the extent any amendments so consented or authorized to relate to any provision
affecting the personal rights and obligations of that agent or trustee in its capacity as such).

**_Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents_**

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement (as described below), the Security Agent may, if
the Issuer consents, amend the terms of, release or waive any of the requirements of or grant consents under, any
document creating Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security which shall be binding on
each party and the prior consent of the Secured Parties is required to authorize any amendment, release or waiver
of, or consent under, any document creating Transaction Security which would adversely affect the nature or
scope of the assets subject to Transaction Security or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security are distributed.

**_Exceptions_**

Subject to the paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or obligations which
are personal to an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent in its capacity as such (including, without limitation,
any ability of that Security Agent to act in its discretion under the Intercreditor Agreement) may not be effected
without the consent of that agent, arranger or, as the case may be, Security Agent.

The preceding paragraph and the first paragraph above under “—Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security
_Documents” are subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, relating in particular to (i) any_
release of Transaction Security, claim or liabilities, or (ii) to any amendment waiver or consent, which, in each
case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the
incurrence of additional or refinancing debt or the provisions set out under “—New Debt Financing,” “Non_Distressed Disposals” and “—Distressed Disposals” above. Any release, amendment, waiver or consent effected_
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Debt Documents relating to such matters can be effected solely
by the Issuer and the Security Agent.

_Snooze/Lose_

If in relation to a request for a consent, to participate in a vote of a class of creditors, to approve any action or to
provide any confirmation or notification, in each case, under the Intercreditor Agreement, any creditor fails to
respond to the request within ten Business Days (or any other period of time notified by the Issuer, with the
agreement of each of the agents or trustee in the case of a shorter period of time) or fails to provide details of its
credit participation, such creditor will be disregarded or be deemed to have zero participation in respect of the
matter or be deemed to have provided the relevant confirmation or notification, as applicable.

_Provisions Following an IPO_

Following an initial public offering of a member of the Senior Secured Group (or a holding company thereof) (an
“IPO”), the Issuer is entitled to give notice that the terms of the Debt Documents will automatically operate so
that, amongst other things, (i) the Senior Secured Group (and all related provisions) will now refer to the member
of the Senior Secured Group or holding company of the Issuer who will issue shares or whose shares are to be
sold pursuant to such IPO (the “IPO Pushdown Entity,” and if any Topco Notes are not refinanced in full on or
before the date of such IPO, the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be any holding company of the Issuer which is the
issuer or borrower of any Topco Liabilities) and its Restricted Subsidiaries, (ii) all financial ratio calculations shall
be made excluding any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity, (iii) certain provisions of the Debt
Documents (including representations, undertakings and events of default) will cease to apply to any holding
company of the IPO Pushdown Entity.

312


-----

Each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be released from all obligations under the Debt
Documents (including any Transaction Security) and each Subordinated Creditor, Third-party Security Provider,
Investor (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreement) or Topco Independent Obligor will be
released from its obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement in the appropriate capacity.

representing more than 50% of any Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders under and as defined in
any Second Lien Facility Agreement, noteholders representing more than 50% of any Second Lien Notes
Liabilities, the majority lenders under and as defined in any Topco Facility and noteholders representing more
than 50% of any Topco Notes Liabilities (following the relevant IPO), each subsidiary of the IPO Pushdown
Entity shall also be released from all obligations as Debtor and guarantor under the Debt Documents and from the
Transaction Security (other than, in each case, borrowing liabilities). Each party to the Intercreditor Agreement
shall be required to enter into any amendment, release or replacement of any Debt Document required to facilitate
such matters.

_Agreement to Override_

Unless expressly stated otherwise therein, the Intercreditor Agreement overrides anything in any other Debt
Documents to the contrary (other than any Transaction Security documents which are governed by German law
and need to be notarized (beurkundet)).

###### CERTAIN TAXATION CONSEQUENCES

**German Taxation**

The following is a general discussion of certain German tax consequences of the acquisition, holding and disposal
of the New Notes. It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all German tax considerations that
may be relevant to a decision to purchase New Notes and, in particular, does not consider any specific facts or
circumstances that may apply to a particular Noteholder. This summary is based on the tax laws of Germany
currently in force and as applied on the date of this Exchange Offer Memorandum, which are subject to change,
possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect.

Prospective purchasers of the New Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences
of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the New Notes, including the effect of any state or local or church
taxes under the tax laws of Germany and any country of which they are residents or whose tax laws apply to them
for other reasons.

**THE FOLLOWING OVERVIEW IS LIMITED TO THE NEW NOTES AND INVESTMENTS IN THE**
**NEW NOTES IN GENERAL AND DOES ONLY TO A LIMITED EXTENT DEAL WITH ASPECTS OF**
**TAXATION IN CONNECTION WITH THE EXCHANGE OF NOTES.**

**Withholding Tax**

Ongoing interest payments received by an individual holder of the New Notes who is a German tax resident (i.e.
persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat or place of effective management is located in Germany)
will be subject to German withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer) if the New Notes are kept or administered in a
custodial account with or presented for an overt-the-counter payment to a German branch of a German or nonGerman bank or financial services institution, a German securities trading company or a German securities trading
bank or if no German bank or financial institution is the Disbursing Agent, the Issuer (each, a “Disbursing Agent”,
_inländische auszahlende Stelle). The withholding tax rate to be withheld by the Disbursing Agent is 25% (plus_
solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable).
Church tax will be collected by the Disbursing Agent by way of withholding unless the holder has filed a blocking
notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für Steuern) in which case
the holders will have to include the income in the tax return and will then be assessed for church tax.

The same treatment applies to capital gains (i.e., the difference between the proceeds from the disposal,
redemption, repayment or assignment after deduction of expenses directly related to the disposal, redemption,
repayment or assignment and the cost of acquisition taking into account currency gains and losses, if any) and
interest accrued on the New Notes (“Accrued Interest” _Stückzinsen) derived by an individual holder who is a_
German tax resident irrespective of any holding period provided that the New Notes have been held in a custodial
account with the same Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition. If interest coupons or interest claims
are disposed of separately (i.e., without the New Notes), the proceeds from the disposition are subject to
withholding tax. The same applies to proceeds from the redemption of interest coupons or the payment of interest
claims if the New Notes have been disposed of separately.

To the extent that the New Notes have not been kept or administered in a custodial account with the same
Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition, upon their disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment
withholding tax applies at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding
being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable) on 30% of the disposal proceeds (plus Accrued Interest, if any),
unless the current Disbursing Agent has been provided with evidence of the actual acquisition costs of the New
Notes by the previous Disbursing Agent or by a statement of a bank or financial services institution within the
European Union, the EEA or the countries/territories Luxembourg, Austria, the Swiss Confederation, the
Principality of Liechtenstein, the Republic of San Marino, the Principality of Monaco, the Principality of Andorra,
Curacao and Sint Maarten. If the withholding tax on a disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the New
Notes has been calculated on the basis of 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than from the actual gain), a German
tax resident individual holder may also apply for an assessment on the basis of its actual acquisition costs;
however, in case the actual gain is higher than 30% of the disposal proceeds a German tax resident individual
holder is obliged to apply for an assessment on the basis of its actual acquisition costs.

In computing any German withholding tax, the Disbursing Agent may generally deduct from the basis of the
withholding tax negative investment income realized by the individual holder of the New Notes via the Disbursing
Agent (e.g., losses from the sale of other securities with the exception of shares). The Disbursing Agent may also

316


-----

deduct Accrued Interest on the New Notes or other securities paid separately upon the acquisition of the respective
security via the Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to certain requirements and restrictions, the Disbursing
Agent may credit foreign withholding taxes levied on investment income in a given year regarding securities held
by the individual holder in the custodial account with the Disbursing Agent.

Upon the individual holder filing an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the Disbursing Agent, the
Disbursing Agent will take a maximum annual allowance (Sparer Pauschbetrag) of €801 (€1,602 for married
couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz über die Eingetragene
_Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly) into account when computing the amount of tax to be withheld from the gross_
payment to be made by the Disbursing Agent. No withholding tax will be deducted if the holder of the New Notes
has submitted to the Disbursing Agent a certificate of non-assessment (Nichtveranlagungsbescheinigung) issued
by the competent tax authorities. According to the coalition agreement signed on December 7, 2021, the new
German government intends to raise the maximum annual allowance (Sparer Pauschbetrag) to €1,000 (€2,000
for married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz über die
_Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly) as of January 1, 2023. However, the German legislator did not_
yet adopt this.

German withholding tax will generally not apply to gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment
of New Notes held by a corporate holder who is a German tax resident (including via a commercial partnership,
as the case may be, and provided that in the case of corporations of certain legal forms the status of corporation
has been evidenced by a certificate of the competent tax authorities) while ongoing payments, such as interest
payments, are subject to withholding tax (irrespective of any deductions of foreign tax and losses incurred). The
same may apply where the New Notes form part of a trade or business (of an individual or of a commercial
partnership) subject to further requirements being met.

Non-residents of Germany are, in general, not subject to German withholding tax on investment income and the
solidarity surcharge thereon. However, where the interest or capital gain is subject to German taxation (as outlined
below under “—Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains—Non-tax-residents”) and the New Notes are held
in a custodial account with a German Disbursing Agent, withholding tax will be levied under certain
circumstances. The withholding tax may be refunded based on an assessment to tax or under an applicable tax
treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen). In addition, non-residents of Germany may be subject to German
withholding tax if they are resident in a non-cooperative tax jurisdiction (nicht cooperatives Steuerhoheitsgebiet)
which is mentioned on the EU list of non-cooperative tax jurisdictions (as outlined below under “—Defense
_against Tax Havens Act”)._

**Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains**

**_Tax-residents_**

This subsection “—Tax-residents” refers to persons who are tax-residents of Germany (i.e., persons whose
residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, or place of effective management and control is located in Germany).

Income derived from capital investments under the New Notes held by an individual holder who is tax resident in
Germany is in general subject to German income tax at a flat-tax rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and church
tax, if applicable, thereon) (Abgeltungsteuer) if the New Notes are held as private investment (Privatvermögen).
Individual holders who are tax resident in Germany are entitled to a maximum annual allowance (Sparer
_Pauschbetrag) of €801 (€1,602 for married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership_
law (Gesetz über die Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly), whereby actually incurred higher
expenses directly attributable to a capital investment are not deductible. According to the coalition agreement
signed on December 7, 2021, the new German government intends to raise the maximum annual allowance (Sparer
Pauschbetrag) to €1,000 (€2,000 for married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership
law (Gesetz über die Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly) as of January 1, 2023. However, the
German legislator did not yet adopt this.

The personal income tax liability of an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany on income from capital
investments under the New Notes will, in principle, be satisfied by the tax withheld (as described under “—
_Withholding Tax” above). To the extent that withholding tax has not been levied, such as in the case of New Notes_
kept in custody abroad or if no Disbursing Agent being involved in the payment process or if the withholding tax
on disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment has been calculated from 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather
than the actual gain), the individual holder must include its interest income and capital gains derived from the
New Notes in its annual tax return and will then also be taxed at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and,

317


-----

where applicable, church tax thereon). Further, an individual holder may apply for a taxation of all investment
income of a given year at its lower individual tax rate based upon an assessment to tax with any amounts overwithheld being refunded. In each case, the deduction of expenses (other than transaction costs) on an itemized
basis is not permitted. Losses incurred with respect to the New Notes may only be offset with investment income
of the individual holder realized in the same or following assessment periods. Losses arising from a bad debt loss
(Forderungsausfall), a waiver of a receivable (Forderungsverzicht) or a transfer of an impaired receivable to a
Third-party or from any other default can only be offset against other income from capital investments and only
up to an amount of €20,000 per year. Respective losses exceeding the amount of €20,000 can be carried forward
and might be usable in future tax periods (together with current capital investment losses of each such tax period)
up to an amount of €20,000 per year. Given that this offset with losses will be applied by the Disbursing Agent
(as defined above) holding the New Notes in custody, Noteholders suffering losses are required to declare such
losses in their income tax return.

Where Notes form part of a trade or business of an individual or corporate holder or the income from the New
Notes qualifies as income from the letting and leasing of property, the withholding tax, if any, will not satisfy the
personal or corporate income tax liability. Rather, the income is subject to individual or corporate income tax
(plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax). Where Notes form part of a trade or business, interest
(including Accrued Interest) and capital gains must be taken into account as income. The respective holder must
include income and related (business) expenses in the annual tax return and the balance will be taxed at the
holder’s applicable tax rate. Withholding tax levied, if any, will be credited as advance payment against the
personal or corporate income tax liability of the holder or, to the extent exceeding this personal or corporate
income tax liability, be refunded. Where Notes form part of a German trade or business the current income and
gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the New Notes may also be subject to German
trade tax (Gewerbesteuer). The trade tax liability depends on the municipal trade tax factor
(Gewerbesteuerhebesatz). If the holder is an individual or an individual partner of a partnership, the trade tax may
generally be completely or partly credited against the personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax credit
method.

The exchange of the Existing Notes for New Notes may result in capital gains to the extent the market value of
the New Notes upon such exchange exceeds the acquisition costs for, or tax accounting basis of, such Existing
Notes. The market value of the Existing Notes should also constitute the acquisition costs of New Notes acquired
in exchange for the Existing Notes. Any capital gains realized upon an exchange are subject to income tax and
withholding tax as outlined above for capital gains from Notes in this subsection “—Tax Residents”. Prospective
holders of the New Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the tax consequences of
an exchange or other disposal of the New Notes.

**_Non-tax-residents_**

This subsection “—Non-tax-residents” refers to persons who are not tax-residents of Germany (i.e., persons whose
residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, and place of effective management and control is not located in
Germany).

Interest and capital gains (which include Accrued Interest and currency gains and losses, if any) from the disposal,
redemption, repayment or assignment of the New Notes received by holders who are not tax resident in Germany
are generally not subject to German taxation, unless (i) the New Notes form part of the business property of a
permanent establishment, including a permanent representative, or a fixed base maintained in Germany by the
holder or (ii) the income otherwise constitutes German source income (such as income from the letting and leasing
of certain German-situs property or income from capital investments directly or indirectly secured by Germansitus real estate or income from a hybrid instrument issued by a German tax resident issuer, unless the New Notes
qualify as global certificates (Sammelurkunden) within the meaning of Section 9a of the German Custody Act
(Depotgesetz) or as fungible notes representing the same issue (Teilschuldverschreibungen)). We expect the New
Notes to qualify for this exception so long as they are held in global form. In cases (i) and (ii) a tax regime similar
to that explained above under “—Tax-residents” applies. Furthermore, the holders who are not tax resident in
Germany may become subject to German withholding tax in case they receive the proceeds by way of an overtthe-counter payment by a German Disbursing Agent and the New Notes are not held in custody with the same
German Disbursing Agent. Subject to certain requirements a holder who is not tax resident in Germany may
benefit from tax reductions or tax-exemptions provided by an applicable tax treaty.

318


-----

**Abolishment of Solidarity Surcharge**

The solidarity surcharge has been partially abolished as of the assessment period 2021 for certain individuals. The
solidarity surcharge, however, continues to apply for capital investments and, thus, on withholding taxes levied.
In case the individual income tax burden for an individual holder is lower than 25% the holder can apply for
his/her capital investment income being assessed at his/her individual tariff-based income tax rate in which case
solidarity surcharge would be refunded.

**Inheritance and Gift Tax**

A gratuitous transfer of Notes by reason of death or as a gift will be subject to German inheritance or gift tax if
the decedent or donor or the heir, donee or other beneficiary is at the time of the transfer a resident or deemed to
be a resident of Germany. If neither the holder nor the recipient is a resident or deemed to be a resident of Germany
at the time of the transfer, no German inheritance or gift taxes will be levied unless (i) the New Notes are
attributable to a German trade or business for which a permanent establishment is maintained or a permanent
representative has been appointed in Germany or (ii) the obligations under the New Notes are directly or indirectly
secured by German-situs real estate (unless the New Notes qualify as fungible notes representing the same issue
(Teilschuldverschreibungen)). We expect the New Notes to qualify for this exception so long as they are held in
global form. Exceptions from this rule apply to certain German citizens who previously maintained a residence in
Germany.

**Other Taxes**

No stamp, issue or registration taxes or such duties will be payable in Germany in connection with the issuance,
delivery or execution of the New Notes. Currently, net assets tax (Vermögenssteuer) is not levied in Germany.

**The Proposed Financial Transactions Tax**

The EU Commission and certain EU member states (including Germany) are intending to introduce a financial
transaction tax (presumably on secondary market transactions involving at least one financial intermediary). The
timing of its potential introduction is, however, still unclear. The implementation of a financial transaction tax in
Germany is no longer included in the most recent coalition agreement signed on December 7, 2021. Prospective
holders of the New Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the financial transaction
tax.

**Defense against Tax Havens Act**

Pursuant to the Defense against Tax Havens Act (Steueroasen-Abwehrgesetz), which entered into force in
Germany on June 26, 2021, income generated, inter alia, from financial relationships (Finanzierungsbeziehungen)
is subject to a withholding tax if the creditor of such financial relationships is resident in a non-cooperative tax
jurisdiction (nicht kooperatives Steuerhoheitsgebiet) which is mentioned on the EU list of non-cooperative tax
jurisdictions, as amended from time to time.

Since there are currently neither official guidelines from the legislator and/or the German tax authorities nor court
rulings on the interpretation of the term 'financial relationships' (Finanzierungsbeziehungen) available, it cannot
be excluded that issuers of exchange listed notes such as the New Notes are obliged to effect a deduction from the
payment under such notes to Noteholders resident in non-cooperative tax jurisdictions pursuant to this law. Should
this be the case, the Issuer would be obliged to effect a withholding of taxes from payments of interest made to
Noteholders resident in non-cooperative tax jurisdictions.

**Payment by a Guarantor**

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on Notes it is possible that such payments may be subject
to withholding tax at applicable rates subject to such relief as may be available under the provisions of any
applicable double taxation treaty or to any other exemption which may apply. It is not certain that such payments
by the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor will be eligible for exemption from withholding tax and that a tax credit
will be available in such case.

**Netherlands Taxation**

The information set out below is a general summary of certain material Dutch tax consequences in connection
with the acquisition pursuant to the Exchange Offers, the ownership and the transfer of the New Notes. This

319


-----

summary is not a comprehensive or complete description of all the Dutch tax considerations that may be relevant
for a particular holder of Existing Notes and/or New Notes and it does not address the tax consequences that may
arise in any jurisdiction other than The Netherlands in connection with the acquisition pursuant to the Exchange
Offers, the ownership and the transfer of the New Notes. For Dutch tax purposes, a holder of Existing Notes and/or
New Notes, may include an individual who or an entity that does not have the legal title to the Existing Notes
and/or the New Notes, as the case may be, but to whom nevertheless the Existing Notes and/or the New Notes, as
the case may be, or the income thereof, are attributed based either on such individual or entity holding a beneficial
interest in the Existing Notes and/or the New Notes, as the case may be, or based on specific statutory provisions.

This summary is based on the tax laws of The Netherlands as in effect on the date of this Exchange Offer
Memorandum, and as applied and interpreted in case law of the courts of The Netherlands and in administrative
guidance of the relevant authorities of The Netherlands, in each case as available in printed form on or before the
date of this Exchange Offer Memorandum, without prejudice to any developments or amendments introduced at
a later date and implemented with or without retroactive effect.

Any reference in this summary to The Netherlands and to Netherlands or Dutch tax law are to the European part
of the Kingdom of The Netherlands and its law, respectively, only.

As this summary is intended as general information only, (prospective) holders of Existing Notes and/or New
Notes should consult their own tax advisors as to the Dutch or other tax consequences of the acquisition pursuant
to the Exchange Offers, the ownership and the transfer of New Notes, including, in particular, the application to
their particular situations of the tax considerations discussed below. Holders of Existing Notes and/or New Notes
may be subject to a special tax treatment under any applicable law and this summary is not intended to be
applicable in respect of all categories of holders of Existing Notes and/or New Notes.

This summary does not describe any Dutch tax consequences in connection with the Existing Notes, unless
indicated otherwise.

**Withholding Tax**

All payments made by the Issuer or, as the case may be, the Dutch Guarantor of interest and principal under the
New Notes may be made free of withholding or deduction of any taxes of whatever nature imposed, levied,
withheld or assessed by The Netherlands or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, except
that Dutch withholding tax (at a rate equal to the highest Dutch corporate income tax rate applicable in the relevant
year) may be due on (deemed) payments of interest and principal (including guarantee payments) under the New
Notes (“Payment”) by the Dutch Guarantor pursuant to the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021 (Wet bronbelasting
_2021) in the following situations:_

(i) in case the Dutch Guarantor is related (gelieerd) (within the meaning set out below) to the entity entitled
to such Payment (voordeelgerechtigde) and such related recipient entity (i) is (deemed) resident in a low
tax jurisdiction (laagbelastende jurisdictie) (within the meaning set out below) or (ii) has a permanent
establishment in such low tax jurisdiction to which the Payment is allocated (worden toegerekend);

(ii) in case the related recipient entity is not (deemed) resident in a low tax jurisdiction (a) such entity is entitled
to the Payment with the main purpose or one of the main purposes of avoiding the levy of tax (belasting)
in the hands of another person or entity and (b) there is an artificial arrangement or transaction, or a series
of artificial arrangements or transactions. An arrangement or transaction, or series of arrangements or
transactions, shall be regarded as artificial to the extent that it is not put into place for valid commercial
reasons, which reflect economic reality; and/or

(iii) in case a related entity is from a Dutch tax perspective regarded the recipient of the Payment, whereas such
related recipient entity is not regarded as the recipient (gerechtigde) thereof pursuant to the laws of the
country in which such entity is (deemed) resident or pursuant to the laws of which such entity is established
(opgericht).

**_Interest payments_**

The term “interest” refers to any remuneration, payment or benefit of whatever nature for moneys advanced
pursuant to a loan (geldlening) or equivalent agreement such as for instance financial lease. This includes interest
accrual and the compensation of costs.

320


-----

**_Related entities_**

Entities (lichamen) are related to the Dutch Guarantor for purposes of the application of the Dutch Withholding
Tax Act 2021 if (i) the recipient entity (alone or together with other entities forming a cooperating group) has a
qualifying interest in the Dutch Guarantor, (ii) the Dutch Guarantor (alone or together with other entities forming
a cooperating group) has a qualifying interest in the recipient entity, or (iii) a third-party (alone or together with
other entities forming a cooperating group) has a qualifying interest in both the recipient entity as well as the
Dutch Guarantor. An interest in an entity is considered a ‘qualifying interest’ if directly or indirectly the influence
in the decision making is such that the decisions of an entity and thus its activities can be determined. In any case,
an interest is qualifying if it represents more than 50% of the statutory voting rights in an entity. Also, a pledge
vested on shares that could give the pledgor more than 50% of the statutory voting rights in an entity upon a
default event, may be considered a qualifying interest.

**_Low tax jurisdictions_**

A jurisdiction qualifies as a low tax jurisdiction for purposes of the Dutch Withholding Tax Act 2021 if it is listed
in an annually updated ministerial decree published by the Dutch government which includes jurisdictions (i) with
a profit tax applying a statutory rate of less than 9% (updated annually based on an assessment as per 1 October
of the preceding year) or (ii) included on the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions in the preceding year.

**Taxes on Income and Capital Gains**

This summary is not intended for any holder of Existing Notes and/or New Notes:

(a) for whom the income or capital gains derived from the Existing Notes and/or the New Notes, as the case
may be, are attributable to a membership of a management board or a supervisory board, an employment
relationship, a deemed employment relationship or a management role, the income of which is taxable in
The Netherlands;

(b) who has, or that has, a Substantial Interest or a deemed Substantial Interest (as defined and explained
below) in the Dutch Guarantor;

(c) that is an entity that is resident or deemed to be resident in The Netherlands and that is, in whole or in part,
not subject to or exempt from Dutch corporate income tax (such as qualifying pension funds);

(d) that is an exempt investment institution (vrijgestelde beleggingsinstelling) or a fiscal investment institution
(fiscale beleggingsinstelling) as meant in articles 6a and 28 of the Dutch Corporate Income Tax Act 1969
(Wet op de vennootschapsbelasting 1969), respectively;

(e) who is, or that is, not considered the beneficial owner (uiteindelijk gerechtigde) of the Existing Notes
and/or the New Notes, as the case may be, and/or the income and/or capital gains derived from the Existing
Notes and/or the New Notes, as the case may be; or

(f) who is for Dutch tax purposes taxable as corporate entity and resident of Aruba, Curacao or Sint Maarten.

Generally a holder of Existing Notes and/or New Notes will have a substantial interest (aanmerkelijk belang) in
the Dutch Guarantor if he holds, alone or, in case the holder is an individual, together with his partner (statutorily
defined term in Dutch tax law), whether directly or indirectly, the ownership of, or certain other rights over, shares
representing 5% or more of the total issued and outstanding capital (or the issued and outstanding capital of any
class of shares) of the Dutch Guarantor, or rights to acquire shares, whether or not already issued, that represent
at any time 5% or more of the total issued and outstanding capital (or the issued and outstanding capital of any
class of shares) of the Dutch Guarantor, or the ownership of certain profit participating certificates that relate to
5% or more of the annual profit or to 5% or more of the liquidation proceeds of the Dutch Guarantor (a
‘‘Substantial Interest’’).

A holder of Existing Notes and/or New Notes will also have a Substantial Interest in the Dutch Guarantor if one
of certain relatives of that holder or of his partner has a Substantial Interest in the Dutch Guarantor. If a holder of
Existing Notes and/or New Notes does not have a Substantial Interest, a deemed Substantial Interest will be
present if (part of) a Substantial Interest has been disposed of, or is deemed to have been disposed of, without
recognizing a taxable gain.

321


-----

**_Dutch Resident Individuals_**

A holder of Existing Notes and/or New Notes, as the case may be, who is an individual and who is resident or
deemed to be resident in The Netherlands for purposes of Dutch taxation (a ‘‘Dutch Resident Individual’’), will
generally be subject to Dutch personal income tax with respect to income and capital gains derived or deemed to
be derived from the Existing Notes and/or New Notes, as the case may be, at the progressive rates up to 49.50%
(maximum rate for 2022) if:

(i) the holder derives profits from an enterprise or deemed enterprise, whether as an entrepreneur
(ondernemer) or pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net worth of such enterprise (other than as an
entrepreneur or a shareholder), to which enterprise the Existing Notes and/or the New Notes, as the case
may be, are attributable or deemed to be attributable; or

(ii) the holder derives income or capital gains, as the case may be, from the Existing Notes and/or the New
Notes, as the case may be, that are taxable as benefits from ‘miscellaneous activities’ (resultaat uit overige
_werkzaamheden), as defined in the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001 (Wet inkomstenbelasting 2001), which_
include the performance of activities with respect to the Existing Notes and/or the New Notes, as the case
may be, that exceed regular, active portfolio management (normaal, actief vermogensbeheer) and also
include benefits resulting from a lucrative interest (lucratief belang).

If neither condition (i) nor condition (ii) mentioned above applies, a Dutch Resident Individual will generally be
subject to Dutch personal income tax on a deemed return pursuant to the regime for income from savings and
investments, regardless of the actual income or capital gains derived from the Existing Notes and/or New Notes,
as the case may be. This deemed return is calculated by applying the applicable deemed return percentage(s) to
the individual’s yield basis (rendementsgrondslag), insofar this exceeds a certain threshold (heffingvrij vermogen).
The individual’s yield basis is determined as the fair market value of certain qualifying assets (including, the
Existing Notes and/or the New Notes, as the case may be) held by the Dutch Resident Individual less the fair
market value of certain qualifying liabilities, both determined on January 1 of the relevant year. The deemed return
percentages to be applied to the yield basis increase progressively from 1.82% to 5.53% (rates for 2022),
depending on such individual’s yield basis. The deemed return percentages are adjusted annually. The deemed
return will be taxed at a rate of 31% (rate for 2022).

However, on December 24, 2021, the Dutch Supreme Court ruled that, under specific circumstances, the Dutch
income tax levy on savings and investments violates the European Convention on Human Rights and the First
Protocol thereto. In reaction to this case law, the Dutch State Secretary for Tax Affairs and Tax Administration
(amongst other things) published a policy decree (beleidsbesluit) on June 28, 2022. This policy decree inter alia
states that if the deemed return based on the actual composition of the yield basis (with separate deemed return
percentages applying for savings, debts and investments) in 2022 is lower than the deemed return based on the
current legislation as described above, the lower deemed return based on the actual composition of the yield basis
will be used to determine the taxable income from savings and investments.

**_Dutch Resident Entities_**

A holder of Existing Notes and/or New Notes, as the case may be, that is an entity (including an association,
partnership and mutual fund, in each case to the extent taxable as a corporate entity) and that is resident or deemed
to be resident in The Netherlands for purposes of Dutch taxation (a ‘‘Dutch Resident Entity’’), will generally be
subject to Dutch corporate income tax with respect to income and capital gains derived or deemed to be derived
from the Existing Notes and/or the New Notes, as the case may be. The Dutch corporate income tax rate is 15%
for the first €395,000 of the taxable amount and 25.8% of the taxable amount exceeding €395,000 (rates for 2022).

**_Non-Dutch Residents_**

A holder of Existing Notes and/or New Notes, as the case may be, who is not, nor deemed to be, a Dutch Resident
Individual or a Dutch Resident Entity (a ‘‘Non-Dutch Resident’’), is generally not subject to Dutch personal
income tax or Dutch corporate income tax with respect to income and capital gains derived from the Existing
Notes and/or the New Notes, as the case may be, provided that:

(i) such Non-Dutch Resident does not derive profits from an enterprise or deemed enterprise, whether as an
entrepreneur (ondernemer) or pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net worth of such enterprise (other than
as an entrepreneur or a shareholder) which enterprise is, in whole or in part, carried on through a permanent
establishment (vaste inrichting) or a permanent representative (vaste vertegenwoordiger) in The

322


-----

Netherlands and to which enterprise or part of an enterprise, as the case may be, the Existing Notes and/or
the New Notes, as the case may be, are attributable or deemed attributable;

(ii) in case of a Non-Dutch Resident who is an individual, such individual does not derive income or capital
gains, as the case may be, from the Existing Notes and/or the New Notes, as the case may be, that are
taxable as benefits from ‘miscellaneous activities’ performed in The Netherlands (resultaat uit overige
_werkzaamheden in Nederland), as defined in the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001 (Wet inkomstenbelasting_
_2001), which include the performance of activities in respect of the Existing Notes and/or the New Notes,_
as the case may be, that exceed regular, active portfolio management (normaal, actief vermogensbeheer)
and also include benefits resulting from a lucrative interest (lucratief belang);

(iii) in case of a Non-Dutch Resident who is an individual, such individual is not entitled to a share in the profits
of an enterprise effectively managed in The Netherlands, other than by way of the holding of securities or
through an employment relationship, to which enterprise the Existing Notes and/or the New Notes, as the
case may be, or payments in respect of the Existing Notes and/or the New Notes, as the case may be, are
attributable; and

(iv) in case of a Non-Dutch Resident that is an entity (including an association, partnership and mutual fund,
in each case to the extent taxable as a corporate entity), such entity is neither entitled to a share in the
profits of an enterprise nor co-entitled to the net worth of an enterprise effectively managed in The
Netherlands, other than by way of the holding of securities, to which enterprise the Existing Notes and/or
the New Notes, as the case may be, or payments in respect of the Existing Notes and/or the New Notes, as
the case may be, are attributable.

**Gift and Inheritance Taxes**

**_Dutch Residents_**

Generally, gift taxes (schenkbelasting) and inheritance taxes (erfbelasting) may arise in The Netherlands with
respect to a transfer of the New Notes by way of a gift by, or on the death of, a holder of New Notes who is
resident or deemed to be resident in The Netherlands for the purpose of the Dutch Gift and Inheritance Tax Act
1956 (Successiewet 1956) at the time of the gift or his/her death.

**_Non-Dutch Residents_**

No Dutch gift or inheritance taxes will be levied on the transfer of New Notes by way of gift by, or on the death
of, a holder of New Notes who is neither resident nor deemed to be resident in The Netherlands for the purpose
of the relevant provisions, unless:

(i) the transfer is construed as an inheritance or bequest or as a gift made by or on behalf of a person who, at
the time of the gift or death, is or is deemed to be resident in The Netherlands for the purpose of the relevant
provisions;

(ii) such holder dies while being resident or deemed resident in The Netherlands within 180 days after the date
of a gift of the New Notes; or

(iii) the gift is made under a condition precedent and such holder is or is deemed to be resident in The
Netherlands at the time the condition is fulfilled.

For purposes of the Dutch Gift and Inheritance Tax Act 1956, an individual who is of the Dutch nationality will
be deemed to be resident in The Netherlands if he/she has been resident in The Netherlands at any time during the
ten years preceding the date of the gift or his/her death.

For purposes of Dutch gift tax, an individual will, irrespective of his/her nationality, be deemed to be resident in
The Netherlands if he/she has been resident in The Netherlands at any time during the twelve months preceding
the date of the gift. The same twelve month rule may apply to entities that have transferred their seat of residence
out of The Netherlands. Applicable tax treaties concluded by The Netherlands may override such deemed
residency.

323


-----

**Value Added Tax**

No Dutch value added tax (omzetbelasting) is payable by a holder of New Notes in respect of payments of interest
and principal under the New Notes or on a transfer of New Notes (other than value added tax due on fees payable
in respect of additional services not exempt from Dutch value added tax).

**Other Taxes and Duties**

No Dutch registration tax, stamp duty or any other similar tax or duty will be payable in The Netherlands by a
holder of New Notes in respect of or in connection with the acquisition pursuant to the Exchange Offers, the
ownership or the transfer of the New Notes.

**Residence**

A holder of New Notes will not become or be deemed to become a resident of The Netherlands for tax purposes
solely by reason of the acquisition pursuant to the Exchange Offers, the ownership or the transfer of the New
Notes.

###### CERTAIN INSOLVENCY CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS

**European Union**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of member states of the EU.

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of May 20, 2015 (applicable to insolvency proceedings opened on or
after June 26, 2017) (as last amended by Regulation (EU) 2021/2260 of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 15 December 2021 amending Regulation (EU) 2015/848 on insolvency proceedings to replace its
Annexes A and B, the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the EU, other than Denmark, the courts
of the member state in which a company’s “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the
EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings. The determination
of where a company has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different
member states may have differing and even conflicting views.

Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a company
has its “centre of main interests” in the member state in which it has its registered office (which presumption shall
not apply if the registered office has been moved to another member state within the three month period prior to
the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings), Article 3(1), second sentence, of the EU Insolvency
Regulation states that the “centre of main interests” of a debtor “should correspond to the place where the debtor
conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties.”

The European Court of Justice has ruled that “a debtor company’s main centre of interests must be determined by
attaching greater importance to the place of the company’s central administration, as may be established by
objective factors which are ascertainable by third parties. Where the bodies responsible for the management and
supervision of a company are in the same place as its registered office and the management decisions of the
company are taken, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, in that place, the presumption, that the centre
of the company’s main interests is located in that place, shall be non-rebuttable. Where a company’s central
administration is, however, not in the same place as its registered office, the presence of company assets and
existence of contracts for the financial exploitation of those assets in a member state other than that in which the
registered office is situated cannot be regarded as sufficient factors to rebut the abovementioned presumption
unless a comprehensive assessment of all relevant factors makes it possible to establish, in a manner that is
ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the
management of its interests is located in that other member state.” The factors to be taken into account include, in
particular, all the places in which the debtor company pursues economic activities and all those in which it holds
assets, in so far as they are ascertainable by third parties. A company’s “centre of main interests” may change
from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open
insolvency proceedings at the time of the request to open or initiate those proceedings.

The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings which are collective insolvency proceedings of
the types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. If the “centre of main interests” of a company
is located in the member state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of
such company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be opened in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court
in such jurisdiction would be entitled to open the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the
EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings opened in one member state under the EU Insolvency
Regulation are to be recognized in the other member states (other than Denmark), although secondary “territorial”
proceedings may be opened in another member state, subject to the conditions set out below.

If the “centre of main interests” of a company is in one member state (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of
the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another member state (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open
“territorial proceedings” against that company only if such company has an “establishment” in the territory of
such other member state (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation).
An “establishment” is defined as “any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the 3month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with
human means and assets.” Accordingly, the opening of territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings in another
member state will also be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such member state in the three month
period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings.

The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other member state are restricted to the assets of the
company situated in such other member state. Where main proceedings in the member state in which the debtor

325


-----

has its “centre of main interests” have not yet been opened, pursuant to Article 3(4) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation, territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings may only be opened in another member state where
the debtor has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the member state in
which the company’s “centre of main interests” is situated under that member state’s law; or (b) the territorial
(secondary) insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in
connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the member state where the
opening of territorial (secondary) proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority that has the right to make such
a request under the law of the member state in which the establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the
insolvency proceedings are main or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain
exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed
jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency
Regulation, the courts of the member state within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened
in accordance with its Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency
proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions.

The opening of insolvency proceedings in a member state pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation shall not
affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable
assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to time, belonging
to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another member state at the time of the opening of proceedings.
Rights in rem include:

- the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or
income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage;

- the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim or
by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee;

- the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them
contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; and

- a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets.

The court of a member state with which a request to open main insolvency proceedings has been lodged retains
exclusive jurisdiction to open such proceedings where the centre of the debtor’s main interests is moved to another
member state after that request has been lodged, but before that court has delivered a decision on it.

Based on a recent decision by the European Court of Justice, the courts of all member states (other than Denmark)
must recognize the judgement of the court opening main proceedings which will be given the same effect in the
other member states so long as no territorial (secondary) proceedings have been opened there. The insolvency
practitioner appointed by a court in a member state which has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because the
debtor’s “centre of main interests” is located there) may exercise the powers conferred on them by the law of that
member state in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the company from that other member state)
subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other member state
or any preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings
in that other member state where the debtor has assets.

Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency officeholder appointed by the court of the
main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on it (by the law of the member state in which the main
proceedings are located) in another member state, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in such
other member state and no preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request to open
insolvency proceedings in such other member state. The insolvency practitioner may, in particular, remove the
debtor’s assets from the territory of the member state in which they are situated, subject to the preservation of (a)
third parties’ right in rem, pursuant to Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation and (b) sellers’ rights based on
a reservation of title, pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Insolvency Regulation.

Under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings
may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another member state by giving a
unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the member state in which secondary insolvency
proceedings could be opened, that the distribution of those assets or of the proceeds received as a result of their
realization, will comply with the distribution and priority rights that would apply under the relevant national law

326


-----

if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in such other member state. Such undertaking must be made in
writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with
the local law of such other member state. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate. Under
Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings
has given such an undertaking and a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, the court shall
(at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings) refuse to open such proceedings
if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors.

Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement
proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court, at
the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the
opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable
measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors.

Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings
will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency
practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is
manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or
renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require
the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the
interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors.

In addition, the EU Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing
difficulties by the commencement of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an insolvency
practitioner in order to facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings of the group’s
members.

In the event that the Issuer experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which
jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such
proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer. The
insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organized or
operate may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the
insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another.

The United Kingdom ceased to be a member of the EU on January 31, 2020 and is therefore no longer a member
state (including for the purposes of the automatic recognition regime under the EU Insolvency Regulation). The
Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146), The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit)
(No. 2) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/1459) and The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (SI
2020/647) set out a number of amendments to the EU Insolvency Regulation as it applies in the United Kingdom
since the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. There has been no agreement to replace the automatic
recognition of United Kingdom insolvency procedures across the EU and vice versa. Absent such agreement,
recognition in the United Kingdom of insolvency proceedings opened in an EU member state is not automatic.
However, such recognition may be available under the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency,
which has been implemented in the United Kingdom by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 and which
provides for recognition of insolvency proceedings in other jurisdictions as either foreign main or foreign nonmain proceedings. In general, insolvency proceedings opened in EU member states qualify as foreign main
proceedings, because foreign proceedings that are taking place in the state where the debtor has the centre of its
main interest are foreign main proceedings according to the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency.
Additionally to the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, the United Kingdom started legislative
consultation in 2022 concerning the implementation of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Enterprise Group
Insolvency as well as the UNCITRAL Model Law on Recognition and Enforcement of Insolvency-Related
Judgements (all aforementioned UNCITRAL Model Laws together, “Model Laws”) as further paths for inbound
recognition of foreign proceedings.

However, please note that any recognition under the Model Laws is a limited substitute compared to the
recognition previously enjoyed under the EU Insolvency Regulation, because recognition under the Model Laws
means broadly recognition of a foreign proceeding as a matter of fact and not the automatic extension of effects
of foreign insolvency proceedings comparable to Article 20 of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Potential relief,
which can be granted as a result of recognition is discretionary. In this context, English courts take into
consideration whether the requested relief is necessary and affected creditors were adequately protected in the
foreign proceeding. Against this backdrop, please note that following the judgement in Re OJSC International

327


-----

_Bank of Azerbaijan (2018) EWCA Civ 2802 English courts will not grant discretionary relief concerning foreign_
proceedings which aim to compromise or modify English law governed debt. Where the obligations to be
restructured are not governed by English law, however, the Model Laws can provide a predictable path for inbound
recognition of EU member state insolvency proceedings in the United Kingdom.

**Germany**

**_Insolvency_**

The Issuer and certain Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, have their registered offices in
Germany and substantially all of their assets are located in Germany. In the event of an insolvency of the Issuer
or a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor organized under the laws of Germany and/or having its “centre of main
interests” in Germany (the Issuer and any other such Guarantor, a “German Notes Guarantor”) at the time the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, any main insolvency
proceedings would most likely be initiated in Germany. Such proceedings would then be governed by German
law (subject to any exceptions for particular matters under the EU Insolvency Regulation). Under certain
circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in Germany in accordance with German law over the
assets of companies that are not established under German law (for example, if the centre of main interests of such
company is within Germany) or, vice versa, insolvency over the Issuer or the German Notes Guarantors may be
opened in other jurisdictions. See “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests—European Union.”_

The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung), may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors than the insolvency laws of the United
States or another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar, including in respect of priority of creditors’ claims,
the ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as in certain circumstances priority recovery for secured creditors
and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and thus may limit your ability to recover payments due on the
New Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany:

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex
officio, but require that the debtor and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings.
Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over indebtedness
(Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event of its illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit), meaning that the debtor is
unable to pay 10% or more of its debts as and when they fall due for a period longer than three weeks. According
to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over indebted when its
liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s
business as a going concern is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) based on a 12-month forecast
horizon (positive Fortführungsprognose). If a limited liability company (GmbH), a public limited liability
company (Aktiengesellschaft), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea) or any
other company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder or partner finds itself in a situation of
illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, the management board or managing director(s) of such company and, in
certain circumstances, its shareholders, are obligated to file for insolvency without undue delay but not later than:
(i) three weeks after such illiquidity; or (ii) six weeks after such over indebtedness occurred or (as the case may
be) was established. Non-compliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damages claim
risks as well as risk of sanctions under criminal law. In addition, only the debtor, but not the creditors, can file for
the opening of insolvency proceedings in the event of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), if
there is the imminent risk of the company being unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due at some point in
time within a 24-month forecast horizon, whereas imminent illiquidity does not give rise to an obligation for the
management of the debtor to file for insolvency proceedings.

If a company faces imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or is over indebted (Überschuldung)
it may also file for preliminary debtor in possession moratorium proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren) unless—
from a third-party perspective—there is no reasonable chance for a successful restructuring. Upon such filing by
the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement
measures (other than with respect to immoveable assets). It may also implement other preliminary measures to
protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months. During that period, the debtor shall
prepare an insolvency plan which ideally shall be implemented in formal debtor in possession proceedings
(Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened.

328


-----

The insolvency proceedings are supervised by the competent insolvency court, which monitors the due
performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take
preliminary measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings
(Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce
individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings insofar as these protective
measures are reasonable to protect the debtor’s assets and/or to ensure the continuation of the debtor’s business.

Due to the economic impacts relating to the developments in and around Russia and the Ukraine, the German
government has initiated another Relief Package (Entlastungspaket III). This is intended in particular to cushion
rising energy and gas costs. Among other things, it indicates that the obligation to file for insolvency will as during
the COVID 19 pandemic be eased. In September 2022, the government factions solicited comments on a draft bill
to introduce certain temporary amendments to German insolvency and restructuring law, limited until December
31, 2023 (the “Government Amendment Proposal”). The proposal includes, inter alia, to limit the forecast period
in the context of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) from twelve to four months, and to extend the maximum
period to file for insolvency in case of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) from six to eight weeks. At the present
time, however, the Government Amendment Proposal has not been formally proposed or passed yet.

Unless the debtor has applied for debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which event the court
will generally only appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of
the affairs by the debtor) the insolvency court will in most cases appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator
(vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the preliminary administrator depend on the decision
of the court. The duties of the preliminary administrator may include safeguarding and preserving the debtor’s
property and assessing whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover at least the costs of the insolvency
proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, even the right to manage the business and dispose of the
assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency administrator. The insolvency court can also order a
stay of all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors against the debtor and other measures the court sees as
appropriate.

During preliminary insolvency proceedings, the insolvency court has to appoint a “preliminary creditors’
committee” (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) if the debtor satisfies at least two of the following three
requirements:

(a) a balance sheet total of at least €6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over
indebted);

(b) revenues of at least €12,000,000 in the twelve-months prior to the last day of the financial year preceding
the filing; and/or

(c) fifty or more employees on an annualized average basis.

The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions made in the
preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will have, for example, the power to influence the following: the selection
of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter) or an insolvency administrator
(Insolvenzverwalter); court orders for debtor in possession proceedings (Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung); and
appointments of (preliminary) trustees ((vorläufiger) Sachwalter). The court opens formal insolvency proceedings
(Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens) if certain formal requirements are met, including if (i) the debtor is in a
situation of imminent illiquidity (if the petition has been filed by the debtor), illiquidity and/or over indebted and
(ii) if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor
are not expected to be sufficient to cover such costs, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency
proceedings if third parties (e.g., creditors), advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement,
the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets
(Abweisung mangels Masse).

Unless the court has ordered debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which case the court will
only appoint a trustee (Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor), upon opening
of the insolvency proceedings, the court will appoint an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) who has
full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets, whereas the debtor is no longer entitled to
dispose of its assets. The insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) will only be entitled to change the individual
appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste
_Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount_
of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii)

329


-----

the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business experienced and
impartial. The insolvency administrator (or in the case of debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung),
the debtor) may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations,
and satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be preferred to
any insolvency liabilities created by the debtor including the Guarantees.

The insolvency administrator or trustee may also challenge transactions that are deemed detrimental to insolvency
creditors and which were effected prior to the opening of the insolvency proceedings (See “—Hardening Periods,
_Fraudulent Transfer and Amendments of German Restructuring Laws by the Restructuring Directive” below)._

For the holders of the New Notes, the consequences of the opening of German insolvency proceedings against the
Issuer or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s subject to the German insolvency regime would include the
following:

(a) unless the court orders debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer and
dispose of the Issuer or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s assets would generally pass to the
(preliminary) insolvency administrator ((vorläufiger) Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the
insolvency estate;

(b) unless the court orders debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected by the
Issuer or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor’s management after the opening of insolvency proceedings
are null and void by operation of law;

(c) if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings, a creditor in the
insolvency proceedings acquires through enforcement (Zwangsvollstreckung) (e.g., attachment) a security
interest in part of the debtor’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security
becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of the insolvency proceedings;

(d) claims against the Issuer or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantors may generally only be pursued in
accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and

(e) any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not
constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for
separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency
administrator.

Certain of these consequences could be achieved by decision of the insolvency court following the insolvency
petition and prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings.

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one
party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of
insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons
justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln)
may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the
contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law.
This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law.

All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the
insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) or are preferred creditors (Massegläubiger) as opposed to a preferential
right (Absonderungsrecht)), who wish to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency
proceedings and have to file their claims against the debtor and the rights they claim in the assets of the debtor
with the insolvency administrator. With the exception of certain secured creditors, an individual enforcement
action brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once the insolvency
proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by a court, also between the time when an insolvency petition
is filed and the time when insolvency proceedings commence). German insolvency proceedings are collective
proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings
separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung). Accordingly, unsecured creditors may file their claims in the insolvency proceedings and
will be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent sufficient assets are available). Secured
creditors are generally not entitled to enforce their security interests after insolvency proceedings have been
commenced to the extent the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) authorizes the insolvency
administrator to dispose of the relevant collateral but have only certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte)

330


-----

in the insolvency proceedings. In this case, secured creditors will only have a right to claim the recoveries (minus
costs and fees) from such realization. Whether or not, after the initiation of insolvency proceedings, a secured
creditor remains entitled to enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on the type of security:
The insolvency administrator generally has the sole right (i) to realize any movable assets within its possession
that are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., pledges over movable assets and rights
(Mobiliarpfandrechte), transfer by way of security (Sicherungsübereignung)) and (ii) to collect any claims that
are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). According to some voices in legal
literature, it is uncertain whether the secured creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect of
pledged uncertificated shares on their own or, insofar as the pledged assets are part of any insolvency estate,
whether the insolvency administrator has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the
secured creditors. However, there is no authoritative case law on this question.

Even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency administrator, the
secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal proceeds
(Absonderungsrecht). Consequently, the enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges of 9% (or more
as agreed upon individually) for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets and (ii) realizing the secured assets
are paid to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured
claims. Remaining amounts (“excess proceeds”) will be allocated to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) and
would, after deduction of the costs of the insolvency proceedings (e.g., fees for and expenses of the preliminary
insolvency administrator, the insolvency administrator and the insolvency court as well as the members of the
creditors’ committee) and after satisfaction of certain preferential liabilities be distributed among the nonpreferential unsecured creditors, including the holders of the New Notes (to the extent not satisfied after
enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the New Notes). If a German Notes Guarantor or a
subsidiary subject to German insolvency proceedings grants security over its assets to creditors other than the
holders of the New Notes, such security may result in a preferred satisfaction of creditors secured by such security
(however, the preferential treatment would be limited to the proceeds obtained through the disposal of the relevant
collateral). The excess proceeds resulting from such collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations
under the New Notes by the German Notes Guarantors after such secured creditors have been satisfied.

The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the insolvency
administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator, however, must
compensate the creditor in accordance with specific rules. In addition, it may take several years before proceeds
from the liquidation of the insolvency estate, if any, are distributed to unsecured creditors. A different distribution
of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the
debtor or the insolvency administrator and which requires, in principle, the consent of the debtor as well as the
consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. The insolvency court may order the
deemed approval of one or more opposing creditor groups under certain conditions (cram-down) in an insolvency
plan (Insolvenzplan) under certain conditions. The insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) may also derogate from other
provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to
implement a debt to equity swap through an insolvency plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor
into a debt to equity conversion if it does not consent to such debt to equity swap. An insolvency plan can further
provide for the release or other impairment of guarantees or other security interests provided by debtor affiliates
(gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten), without such debtor affiliates being subject to the debtor’s or separate
insolvency proceedings, provided that the relevant debtor affiliate consents to the impairment. Creditors affected
by such impairment are entitled to receive adequate compensation.

Under certain conditions, the debtor may also file for protective shield proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren). In
such case and upon request of the debtor, the court will prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to
immovable assets) and may implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from credit enforcement
actions for up to three months if an independent expert testifies that the restructuring of the debtor’s business is
not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos) and that the debtor is not already illiquid.

Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in
the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency law point of view,
has to be dealt with separately (i.e., there is no group insolvency concept under German insolvency law). As a
consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims
of and vis à vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. As a general principle, the claims arising from a
guarantee may be enforced against a German Notes Guarantor outside of the insolvency proceedings over the
assets of the Issuer. Any insolvency proceeding over the assets of the Issuer would, however, be a rather strong
indication that the overall financial situation of the entire group of affiliated companies has significantly
deteriorated, which may cause a German Notes Guarantor to subsequently file for insolvency. On April 13, 2017,

331


-----

the German legislator passed an act to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der
_Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen), which came into force on April 21, 2018. This act is mainly intended to_
facilitate the coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. This act does
not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation
of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group,
but rather stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient
administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may assume jurisdiction for other group company
insolvency proceedings (Gruppen Gerichtsstand); (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency
administrator for all relevant group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on
insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for
“coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordinator”
(Verfahrenskoordinator) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan).

German insolvency law provides for certain creditors and their claims to be subordinated by law (including, but
not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of repayment
of shareholder loans or comparable actions). The restrictive nature of the covenants and undertakings in the New
Notes Indenture may result in the holders of the New Notes and/or the applicable Trustee being considered in a
“shareholder like position” (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung). In that event, in an insolvency proceeding over the
assets of a German Notes Guarantor, the claims arising from a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee would be treated
as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen). Subordinated insolvency claims are not
eligible to participate in the insolvency proceedings over the assets of a German Notes Guarantor unless the
insolvency court handling the case has granted special permission allowing these subordinated insolvency claims
to be filed which is not granted in the vast majority of insolvency cases governed by German law. Claims of a
person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally
rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. See also below under “—Satisfaction of Subordinated
_Claims.”_

Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon
the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless
and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance.

_Limitations on Enforcement_

Some of the German Notes Guarantors are incorporated in Germany in the form of a limited liability company
(GmbH) and/or a public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft). Consequently, the granting of guarantees,
indemnities and security interests by these companies is subject to certain provisions of the German Limited
Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbHG”), the German
Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and other laws. These provisions would also apply to any future German Notes
Guarantor in the form of a GmbH or a partnership with a GmbH as unlimited liability partner (e.g., GmbH & Co.
KG) or Aktiengesellschaft.

_GmbH Limitation Language_

As a general rule, sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its
assets to its direct or indirect shareholders, to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets (i.e., assets
minus liabilities and liability reserves) is already less or would fall below the amount of its stated share capital
(Stammkapital). The granting or enforcement of guarantees or security interests by a GmbH in order to guarantee
or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company may be considered disbursements under
Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to issue guarantees or create security
interests to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections
30 and 31, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to
contain “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of a GmbH or partnership with a GmbH
as unlimited liable partner incorporated or established in Germany. Pursuant to such limitation language, the
beneficiaries of the guarantees or the security interests agree, subject to certain adjustments and exemptions, to
enforce the guarantees or the security interests against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such
enforcement does not result in the GmbH’s (or, in case of a partnership with a GmbH as unlimited liable partner,
such GmbH’s) net assets falling below its stated share capital or, as the case may be, if the net assets are already
below the amount of its stated share capital, to cause such amount to be further reduced. Accordingly, the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee, the New Notes Indenture and the Security Documents provided by the German Notes
Guarantors contains or will contain, respectively, such limitation language and therefore the enforcement of the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, the New Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral is limited in

332


-----

the manner described. This could lead to a situation in which the respective guarantee or security granted by the
relevant German Notes Guarantor cannot be enforced at all.

The limitation language for any GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG incorporated into the relevant documents relating to
the New Notes, in particular in the New Notes Indenture, will be substantially in the form as follows:

(a) “The restrictions in this Clause shall apply to any guarantee, indemnity, liability and other payment
obligations under this Clause or any other provision in this Indenture and/or any other documents in
connection therewith granted by a Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Germany as a limited liability
company (GmbH) (a “German GmbH Guarantor”) to secure liabilities of its current or any future direct
or indirect shareholder(s) (upstream) or a subsidiary of such shareholder (but excluding any direct or
indirect subsidiary of such Guarantor) (cross stream) (a “Guarantee”).

(b) The restrictions in this Clause shall not apply:

(i) with respect to a Capital Impairment (as defined below), to the extent the German GmbH Guarantor
secures any indebtedness under this Indenture in respect of (i) loans to the extent such loans are
(directly or indirectly) on lent or otherwise passed on to the relevant German GmbH Guarantor or
its subsidiaries or (ii) bank guarantees or letters of credit that are issued for the benefit of any of the
creditors of the German GmbH Guarantor or the German GmbH Guarantor’s subsidiaries, in each
case, to the extent that any such on lending or otherwise passing on or bank guarantees or letters of
credit are still outstanding at the time of the enforcement of the Guarantee; for the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this paragraph (b) shall have the effect that such on lent amounts may be enforced
multiple times (no double dip);

(ii) with respect to a Capital Impairment (as defined below), if, at the time of enforcement of the
Guarantee, a domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement (Beherrschungs- und/oder
_Gewinnabführungsvertrag) as per Section 291 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) (either_
directly or indirectly through an unbroken chain of domination and/or profit transfer agreements)
exists between the relevant German GmbH Guarantor as a dominated company, and:

(A) that German GmbH Guarantor is a subsidiary of the relevant obligor whose obligations are
secured by the relevant Guarantee, that Guarantor; or

(B) the German GmbH Guarantor and the relevant Guarantor whose obligations are secured by
the relevant Guarantee are both subsidiaries of a joint (direct or indirect) parent company
and such parent company as dominating entity (beherrschendes Unternehmen), in each case
to the extent the existence of such domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement
(Beherrschungs- und/oder Gewinnabführungsvertrag) leads to the inapplicability of section
30 paragraph 1 sentence 1 of the German Limited Liability Company Act (GmbHG);

(iii) with respect to a Capital Impairment (as defined below), to the extent any payment under the
Guarantee demanded by the Trustee from the relevant German GmbH Guarantor is covered
(gedeckt) by a fully valuable and recoverable consideration or recourse claim (vollwertiger
_Gegenleistungs oder Rückgewähranspruch) of the German GmbH Guarantor against the affiliate_
whose obligations are secured by the relevant Guarantee; or

(iv) if the relevant German GmbH Guarantor has not complied with its obligations pursuant to
paragraphs (d) and (e) below. However, if and to the extent that the Guarantee has been enforced
without regard to the restrictions contained in this Clause because the Management Notification (as
defined herein) and/or the Auditor’s Determination (as defined below) has not (or not in a timely
manner) been delivered pursuant to paragraphs (d) and (e) below, but the Auditor’s Determination
has then been delivered within four months from its due date in accordance with paragraph (e)
below, the Trustee shall upon demand of the German GmbH Guarantor repay any amount received
from the German GmbH Guarantor which pursuant to the Auditor’s Determination would not have
been available for enforcement, if the Auditor’s Determination had been delivered in a timely
manner.

(c) The parties to this Indenture agree that if and to the extent payment under the Guarantee would cause (i)
the amount of a German GmbH Guarantor’s Net Assets, as calculated and defined pursuant to paragraph
(g) below, to fall below the amount required to maintain its registered share capital (Stammkapital) or
increase an existing shortage (Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz) of its registered share capital (Stammkapital)

333


-----

and thereby violating sections 30, 31 of the German Limited Liability Company Act (GmbHG) (such event,
a “Capital Impairment”), or (ii) a German GmbH Guarantor to be deprived of the liquidity necessary to
fulfil its liabilities towards its creditors and thereby violating section 15b (5) of the German Insolvency
Code (Insolvenzordnung, InsO). (such event, a “Liquidity Impairment”) then the Trustee shall not enforce
and the German GmbH Guarantor shall, subject to paragraphs (d) and (e) below, have a defense (Einrede)
against any claim under the Guarantee if and to the extent such Capital Impairment or Liquidity Impairment
would occur.

(d) If the relevant German GmbH Guarantor does not notify the Trustee in (the “Management Notification”)
within fifteen (15) Business Days after the making of a demand against that German GmbH Guarantor
under the Guarantee:

(i) to what extent such Guarantee is an upstream or cross stream guarantee or indemnity; and

(ii) to what extent a Capital Impairment or Liquidity Impairment would occur as a result of an
enforcement of the Guarantee (setting out in reasonable detail the amount of its Net Assets or to
which extent the liquidity would be deprived, providing an up to date pro forma balance sheet or
liquidity statement),

then the restrictions set out in this Clause shall cease to apply until a Management Notification has been
provided.

(e) If the Trustee disagrees with the Management Notification, it may within twenty (20) Business Days of its
receipt, request the relevant German GmbH Guarantor to provide to the Trustee within forty five (45)
Business Days of receipt of such request a determination by the German GmbH Guarantor’s auditors or
any other auditors of international standard and reputation (the “Auditor’s Determination”) appointed by
the German GmbH Guarantor (at its own cost and expense) setting out in reasonable detail the amount in
which the payment under the Guarantee would cause a Capital Impairment or Liquidity Impairment,
subject to the terms set out under this Clause. Save for manifest errors, the Auditor’s Determination shall
be binding on all parties.

(f) If, after it has been provided with an Auditor’s Determination which prevented it from demanding any or
only partial payment under the Guarantee, the Trustee ascertains in good faith that the financial conditions
of the German GmbH Guarantor as set out in the Auditor’s Determination has substantially improved, the
Trustee may (acting reasonably), at the German GmbH Guarantor’s cost and expense, arrange for the
preparation of an updated balance sheet of the German GmbH Guarantor by applying the same principles
that were used for the preparation of the Auditor’s Determination by the auditors who prepared the
Auditor’s Determination in order for such auditors to determine whether (and, if so, to what extent) the
Capital Impairment and Liquidity Impairment has been cured as result of the improvement of the financial
condition of the German GmbH Guarantor. The Trustee may not arrange for the preparation of an Auditor’s
Determination prior to the expiry of three months from the date of the issuance of the preceding Auditor’s
Determination. The Trustee may only demand payment under the Guarantee to the extent the auditors
determine that the Capital Impairment and Liquidity Impairment have been cured.

(g) The net assets (Reinvermögen) of the German GmbH Guarantor (the “Net Assets”) shall be calculated in
accordance with section 42 of the German Limited Liability Company Act (GmbHG), sections 242, 264
of the HGB and the generally accepted accounting principles applicable from time to time in Germany
(Grundsätze ordnungsgemäßer Buchführung) and for the purposes of calculating the Net Assets, the
following balance sheet items shall be adjusted as follows:

(i) the amount of any increase in the registered share capital of the relevant German GmbH Guarantor
which was carried out after the relevant German GmbH Guarantor became a party to this Agreement
and made from retained earnings (Kapitalerhöhung aus Gesellschaftsmitteln) shall be deducted
from the amount of the registered share capital (Stammkapital) of the relevant German GmbH
Guarantor if it is expressly prohibited under this Indenture and has been carried out without the
prior written consent of the agent;

(ii) the amount of non-distributable assets according to Section 253 subsection 6 of the HGB shall not
be included in the calculation of Net Assets;

(iii) the amount of non-distributable assets according to Section 268 subsection 8 of the HGB shall not
be included in the calculation of Net Assets;

334


-----

(iv) the amount of non-distributable assets according to Section 272 subsection 5 of the HGB shall not
be included in the calculation of Net Assets; and

(v) loans or other liabilities incurred by the relevant German GmbH Guarantor in willful or grossly
negligent violation of this Indenture shall not be taken into account as liabilities.

(h) Where a German GmbH Guarantor claims in accordance with the provisions of this Clause that the
Guarantee can only be enforced in a limited amount, it shall (A) realize, to the extent lawful and within
reasonable opinion commercially justifiable, any and all of its assets that are shown in the balance sheet
with a book value (Buchwert) that is significantly lower than the market value of the assets and are not
necessary (betriebsnotwendig) for the relevant German GmbH Guarantor’s business, and (B) use best
efforts to realize, to the extent legally permitted in a situation where it does not have sufficient liquidity to
fulfil its liabilities to its creditors, any and all of its assets if the relevant asset is not necessary for the
German GmbH Guarantor’s business (nicht betriebsnotwendig).

(i) Nothing in this Clause shall constitute a waiver (Verzicht) of any right granted under this Indenture to the
Trustee.

(j) Nothing in this Clause shall prevent the Trustee or a German GmbH Guarantor from claiming in court that
the provision of this Guarantee and/or making payments under this Guarantee by the relevant German
GmbH Guarantor does or does not fall within the scope of sections 30 or 31 of the German Limited Liability
Company Act (GmbHG) and/or section 15b (5) of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung, InsO)
and/or section 826 German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch).

(k) In addition to the restrictions set out in this Clause, if a German GmbH Guarantor demonstrates that,
according to the decisions of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) or a higher regional
court of appeals (Oberlandesgericht), the enforcement of any upstream or cross stream guarantee or
security interest against such German GmbH Guarantor would result in personal liability of its managing
director(s) (Geschäftsführer) for a reimbursement of payments made under the Guarantee (including,
without limitation, pursuant to section 826 of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch)), the
German GmbH Guarantor shall have a defense (Einrede) against the Guarantee to the extent required in
order not to incur such liability.

(l) The provisions of this Clause shall apply to a limited partnership with a limited liability company as its
general partner (GmbH & Co. KG) mutatis mutandis and all references to Capital Impairment, Liquidity
Impairment and Net Assets shall be construed as a reference to the Capital Impairment, Liquidity
Impairment and Net Assets of the general partner (Komplementär) of the German GmbH Guarantor.

(m) For the purposes of this Clause, a reference to a “German GmbH Guarantor” includes any limited liability
company incorporated (or limited partnership with a limited liability company as its general partner) in a
jurisdiction other than Germany whose centre of main interest (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of
Regulation (EU) No. 2015/848 of May 20, 2015 on Insolvency Proceedings) is in Germany.

(n) The parties are aware that—due to recent developments—it is currently discussed which point in time is
relevant when determining whether a managing director or other representative of a German guarantor has
complied with the capital maintenance provisions. In respect of a valuation of the Net Assets which are
available for enforcement of a guarantee without causing any liability for management, the parties consider
the point in time of the enforcement of the Guarantee as being relevant which is therefore the relevant point
in time for calculating the available Net Assets purposes of this Clause. Should new legislation or
jurisprudence of a higher regional court (Oberlandesgericht) or the Federal Court of Justice
(Bundesgerichtshof) (including, without limitation, based on proceedings initiated by the relevant
Guarantor and/or its managing directors (Geschäftsführer)) be published and/or come into force after the
date of this Indenture and should such law or court ruling lead to a different legal and/or factual assessment:

(i) of the granting of the guarantee by the relevant Guarantor, the Trustee shall, upon the relevant
Guarantor’s managing directors’ (Geschäftsführer) (or other representative’s) request, enter into
good faith negotiations on possible amendments to this Clause to the extent necessary to avoid the
managing directors’ (Geschäftsführer) (or other representative’s) personal liability resulting from
the granting of the guarantee (taking into account the initial intention of the limitations set out in
this Clause and, including but not limited to, amending reference points for the assessment whether
or not a violation of sections 30 or 31 GmbHG has occurred); or

335


-----

(ii) of the enforcement of the guarantee so that the limitations in this Clause are, are not, or only partially
be, required to protect the managing directors (Geschäftsführer) (or other representatives) of the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantor(s) from the risk of personal liability from the enforcement of the
guarantee, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors shall, upon the Trustee’s request, enter into good
faith negotiations on possible amendments to this Clause to the extent such provisions are, or are
not required anymore to protect the managing directors (Geschäftsführer) (or other representative’s)
of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor(s) from the risk of personal liability arising from the
enforcement of the guarantee.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Clause and any rights and/or obligations arising
out of it shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, German law.”

_AG Limitation Language_

As a general rule, Section 57 German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) prohibits the disbursement of the deposits to
the stockholders (Verbot der Einlagenrückgewähr). In addition, pursuant to Section 71a German Stock
Corporation Act (AktG) the relevant German public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft) may not grant
any loan or grant and security to a Third-party for purposes of the acquisition of the stock in such German public
limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft). Any agreement in such respect is void.

Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to issue guarantees or create security interests to secure
liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Section 57 German Stock
Corporation Act (AktG) and/or Section 71 a German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), it is standard market practice
for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain “limitation language” in relation
to subsidiaries in the legal form of a German public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft). Pursuant to
such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the guarantees or the security interests agree to enforce the
guarantees or the security interests against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such enforcement does
not lead to a violation of Section 57 German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and/or Section 71 a German Stock
Corporation Act (AktG). Accordingly, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, the New Notes Indenture and the
Security Documents relating to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral provided by the German Notes Guarantors
contains or will contain, respectively, such limitation language and therefore the enforcement of the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees and the New Notes Indenture is limited in the manner described below. This could lead
to a situation in which the respective guarantee or security granted by the relevant German Notes Guarantor cannot
be enforced at all. In particular, STADA, which, together with the other Guarantors, provided a Senior Secured
Notes Guarantees under the Senior Secured Notes following the occurrence of the control date on March 20, 2018,
is incorporated in Germany in the form of a German public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft). As all
the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors are direct or indirect subsidiaries of STADA, all limitations applicable to a
German public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft) (whether by virtue of law or contractual limitation
language) will consequently also apply to such subsidiaries even if incorporated in a legal form other than a
German public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft). See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the New
_Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Senior_
_Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may adversely affect the validity and_
_enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral.”_

The limitation language for any public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft) incorporated into the
relevant documents relating to the New Notes, in particular in the Security Documents, is substantially in the form
as follows:

(a) “Any guarantee or any liability, indemnity or other payment obligation (the “Guarantee”) of a Guarantor
which is a public limited liability company under German law (Aktiengesellschaft) (an “AG Guarantor”)
or by any Guarantor that is a subsidiary of that AG Guarantor shall not be enforced to the extent such
Guarantee secures or relates to liabilities which are owed by direct or indirect shareholders of that AG
Guarantor or subsidiaries of such shareholders (such subsidiaries not to include the AG Guarantor and the
subsidiaries of that AG Guarantor) if the relevant AG Guarantor is not party to a domination and/or profit
and loss pooling agreement (Beherrschungs und/oder Gewinnabführungsvertrag) as the dominated party
with a direct shareholder as the dominating party.

(b) If a domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement (Beherrschungs _und/oder_
_Gewinnabführungsvertrag) is in force between the relevant AG Guarantor and a direct shareholder (with_
the direct shareholder as dominating party) any Guarantee granted by such AG Guarantor or by any
subsidiary of that AG Guarantor under this Agreement shall be enforceable except that it shall not be

336


-----

enforceable (vollstreckbar) if and to the extent (i) the payment by the AG Guarantor or by a subsidiary of
that AG Guarantor in respect of those guarantees which secure liabilities which are owed by direct or
indirect shareholders of that AG Guarantor or subsidiaries of such shareholders (such subsidiaries not to
include the AG Guarantor and the subsidiaries which are also subsidiaries of that AG Guarantor) will, or
must be expected to, result in an annual loss to that AG Guarantor and (ii) such annual loss would not be,
or cannot be expected to be, compensated for by a compensation claim under the relevant domination
and/or profit and loss pooling agreement (Beherrschungs-und/oder Gewinnabführungsvertrag) that can be
accounted for in the balance sheet of that AG Guarantor at full value (vollwertig), unless the mere existence
of a domination and/or profit and loss pooling agreement (Beherrschungs-und/oder
_Gewinnabführungsvertrag) between the relevant AG Guarantor and a direct shareholder (with the direct_
shareholder as dominating party) leads to the inapplicability of Section 57 sub section 1 of the German
Stock Corporation Act (AktG) in which case sub paragraphs (i) and (ii) shall not be applicable and which
shall be deemed to be the case if so explicitly confirmed with reasons (and not, for example, as an obiter
dictum) by the Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) in a Third-party case.

(c) The validity and enforcement of any Guarantee granted by an AG Guarantor shall not be limited to the
extent any payment under the Guarantee demanded by a finance party from the relevant AG Guarantor is
covered (gedeckt) by a fully valuable and recoverable consideration or recourse claim (vollwertiger
_Gegenleistungs oder Rückgewähranspruch) of the AG Guarantor against the affiliate whose obligations_
are secured by the relevant Guarantee and would therefore not lead to a violation of Section 57 sub section
1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), unless this exception would lead to a violation of Section
71a of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the validity and enforceability of any Guarantee granted by an AG Guarantor
or of any subsidiary of that AG Guarantor in respect of any borrowing liabilities which are owed by that
AG Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries shall not be limited under paragraphs (a) and (b) above.

(e) The validity and enforcement of any Guarantee granted by an AG Guarantor or of any subsidiary of that
AG Guarantor shall not be limited under paragraphs (a) and (b) above in an amount equal to the amount
drawn under the credit facilities (the “Drawn Amount”) if and to the extent such Drawn Amount is applied
for the repayment, prepayment or other refinancing of any financial indebtedness of such AG Guarantor
or subsidiary of such AG Guarantor, provided that exception does not lead to a violation of Section 57 of
the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).

(f) The restrictions set out in paragraph (b) above do not affect the rights of the finance parties to claim any
outstanding amount again at a later point in time if and to the extent paragraph (b) above would allow such
claim at that later point.

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, the limits set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall no further apply from
the date the AG Guarantor is no longer incorporated as a public limited liability company
(Aktiengesellschaft) unless such Guarantor is a subsidiary of another AG Guarantor in which case
paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall apply in a way that the Guarantor shall be treated as a subsidiary of that
other AG Guarantor in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) above. In such event, the limits set out in
paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall not apply to the Guarantee granted by that Guarantor in respect of any
liabilities which are owed by that other AG Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries.

Any guarantee, indemnity or upstream benefit granted under any Finance Document by STADA or any of its
subsidiaries in respect of liabilities of its current or any future direct or indirect shareholder(s) (upstream) or a
Subsidiary of such shareholder (but excluding any direct or indirect subsidiary of STADA) (cross stream) will in
any case take effect not earlier than immediately after the occurrence of the Control Date (as defined under
“Description of the New Notes”).

(h) German terms in this Clause (including any reference to German statutory provisions) shall be construed
in accordance with German law.”

_General Comments regarding German Limitation Language_

German capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance and financial assistance rules (including with respect to
Sections 30 and 31 GmbH, section 15b (5) of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung, InsO) and Sections
57, 71a and 92(2) sentence 3 the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)), are subject to evolving case law. We
cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of its

337


-----

subsidiaries constituted in the form of, as applicable, an AG, a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG, which can negatively
affect the ability of the German Notes Guarantors to make payments on the New Notes or the Senior Secured
Notes Guarantees or the enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, the New Notes Indenture and the
Security Documents relating to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral (i.e. the share pledges and any other security
interest) provided by the German Notes Guarantors.

In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof)
regarding “destructive interference” (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation in which a shareholder
deprives a GmbH of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts
with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee or other collateral granted by the German Notes Guarantors. In
such a case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to nil.
Moreover, according to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security
agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the stressed
financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding
the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law
with respect to the granting of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees or any Senior Secured Notes Collateral by
the German Notes Guarantors (including in the legal form of an AG).

Furthermore, the beneficiary (e.g., a holder of the New Notes) of a transaction qualifying as a repayment of the
stated share capital of a grantor of a guarantee or security interest, as applicable, (e.g., the enforcement of such
guarantee or security interest) could moreover become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The
German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor
were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in
violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary
of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee or provider of
security interest is close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

_Parallel Debt; Security Interests_

Under German law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the pledgee
and the creditor of the secured claim be the same person. Such accessory security interests (akzessorische
_Sicherungsrechte) cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not (yet) hold the secured claim, will_
automatically lapse to the extent a secured claims is settled, discharged or novated, and may not be assigned
independently, but will automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured claim is assigned.
The holders of interests in the New Notes from time to time will not be party to the Security Documents. In order
to permit the holders of the New Notes from time to time to benefit from pledges granted to the Security Agent
under German law, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of a “parallel debt.” Pursuant to the
creation of the parallel debt, the Security Agent has its own separate and independent claim equal to each amount
payable by each obligor under, in particular, the New Notes. The pledges governed by German law will directly
and exclusively (to the extent the New Notes are concerned) secure the parallel debt rather than the obligations
under the New Notes or the holders of the New Notes directly. The validity of the parallel debt concept and of the
pledges granted under German law to secure such parallel debt has not been tested under German law, and there
is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by German law. Therefore, the
ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be restricted. In addition, holders
of the New Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the New Notes.”

German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon enforcement of
the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the asset constituting
the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods and notice
requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the collateral gives the
Security Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted such security from foreclosing
on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests
only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization
of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay
on proceedings initiated by other creditors).

_Hardening Periods, Fraudulent Transfer and Amendments of German Restructuring Laws by the Restructuring_
_Directive_

Under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), an insolvency administrator or in the event that debtor
in possession proceedings have been ordered, the trustee (Sachwalter) may also challenge (anfechten)
transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and were effected
prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings during applicable avoidance periods. The administrator’s
or the trustee’s right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions during
the ten year period prior to the filing of the petition for commencement of insolvency proceedings. On March 29,
2017, the German legislator passed an act for the improvement of legal certainty concerning clawback pursuant
to the German Insolvency Code and the German Avoidance Act (Gesetz zur Verbesserung der Rechtssicherheit
_bei Anfechtungen nach der Insolvenzordnung und nach dem Anfechtungsgesetz), which entered into force on April_
5, 2017 (subject to certain transitional provisions). The amendments to the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung) and the German Avoidance Act (Anfechtungsgesetz) concern, inter alia, the provisions on
avoidance for intentionally disadvantaging Third-party creditors (Vorsatzanfechtung), cash transactions
(Bargeschäfte) and interest accruing on avoidance claims.

In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to us, which would be based on and governed by the
insolvency laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the holders of the New Notes as well as the granting
of collateral for or providing credit support for the benefit of the New Notes could be subject to potential
challenges by an insolvency administrator or, as the case may be, trustee under the rules of avoidance as set forth
in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). In case the validity or enforceability of the New Notes or
any collateral in favor of the New Notes is challenged successfully, the holder of the New Notes may not be able
to recover any amounts under the New Notes or the relevant collateral. If payments have already been made under
the New Notes or collateral, any amounts received from a transaction that had been challenged would have to be
repaid to the insolvency estate. In this case, holders of the New Notes would only have a general unsecured claim
under the New Notes without preference in insolvency proceedings.

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which terms also include the provision
of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided in the following cases, as amended by the act to improve
legal certainty with respect to avoidance claims under the German Insolvency Code and the German Code on
Avoidance (Gesetz zur Verbesserung der Rechtssicherheit bei Anfechtungen nach der Insolvenzordnung und dem
_Anfechtungsgesetz) which became effective on April 5, 2017:_

(a) any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a
guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months
prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings, if the debtor was illiquid
(zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of
circumstances that imperatively suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of
the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or
the filing of such petition (or of circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity or filing); whereby
in each case an affiliated party shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s insolvency or of the
filing to open insolvency proceedings;

(b) any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (including a
guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled or which was
granted or obtained in a form in which or at a time at which such creditor was not entitled to such security
or satisfaction, if (i) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was taken during the second or
third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time or (iii) such act was
taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other
insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that imperatively suggest such detrimental
effect); whereby in case of (iii) above an affiliated party shall be presumed to have been aware of the
detrimental nature of such transaction for the other creditors;

(c) any transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor
loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or
becomes enforceable, provided it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of the
petition of the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such
transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) after the

339


-----

filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such
transaction knew of either the debtor’s illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction; whereby in
each case an affiliated party shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s illiquidity or of the filing
to open insolvency proceedings;

(d) any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security (including a
guarantee) for a Third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously
(unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement
of insolvency proceedings;

(e) any act performed by the debtor (i) during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing with the intent to prejudice the
insolvency creditors and the other party knew of such intention at the time of such act, with such knowledge
being presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor’s illiquidity was imminent and that the transaction
disadvantaged the other creditors (except for acts granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an
insolvency creditor, to obtain security or satisfaction to which such creditor was entitled, in which case
such knowledge (solely) being presumed if such creditor knew that the debtor was illiquid and that the
transaction disadvantaged the other creditors), (ii) except for such acts granting an insolvency creditor, or
enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain security (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) (whether or
not it was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled to such
security or satisfaction), which may only be avoided if they were effected in the four years prior to the
filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or at a time after the filing;

(f) any non-gratuitous contract (entgeltlicher Vertrag) concluded between the debtor and an a related party
(nahestehende Person) which directly operates to the detriment of the creditors can be challenged unless
such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its
creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term ‘related party’
includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners
and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding
comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and
other persons that are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons;

(g) any act that provides security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a
shareholder loan made to the debtor or an economically similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of
security, the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of
insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took
place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or
after the filing of such petition. It being understood, that the regulation for shareholder loans does not apply
(i) to shareholders which own 10% or less of the shares or interest and are not engaged in management and
(ii) until the successful restructuring of the debtor in case a creditor for the first time acquires shares during
over indebtedness, illiquidity or imminent illiquidity for the purpose of restructuring the debtor; and

(h) any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a
Third-party if (i) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted
security or was liable as a guarantor or surety provider (Garant oder Bürge) (in which case the shareholder
has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the
conclusion must be drawn that the debtor (e.g., a German Notes Guarantor) was unable to pay its debts generally
as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was
detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. Knowledge of pending
restructuring proceedings (see ⸺Preventive Restructuring Framework) per se does not suffice for a creditor to be
deemed to have such “knowledge”. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice
the insolvency creditors if it knew of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the
debtor’s creditors. If the relevant act granted an insolvency creditor, or enabled an insolvency creditor to obtain,
security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) in a form in which and at a time at
which such creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction (kongruente Deckungshandlung), the words
“imminent illiquidity” (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) in the preceding sentence have to be replaced by “actual
illiquidity” (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit). If an insolvency creditor concluded a payment agreement

340


-----

(Zahlungsvereinbarung) with, or granted other forms of deferred payment terms (Zahlungserleichterung) to, the
debtor, there is a rebuttable presumption that the insolvency creditor did not have knowledge of the illiquidity of
the debtor at the time of such act. With respect to a “related party,” there is a general statutory presumption that
such party had “knowledge.” Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been challenged would have to
be repaid to the insolvency estate.

The COVInsAG provides for privileged treatment of new financing and shareholder loans under German
insolvency law claw-back provisions, if such loans were provided during a certain time during the COVID-19
pandemic. On that basis, the repayment (including reasonable interest payments) of third-party financing and
shareholder loans by September 30, 2023 shall not be considered disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant
financing was granted between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2021 and the debtor fulfilled the requirements for the
suspension of the filing duties at that time. This privilege also covers the provision of collateral in favor of thirdparty financing providers, but does not apply in case of the provision of collateral in favor of shareholder loans or
receivables from economically similar acts.

Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a Third-party creditor who has obtained an
enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) but has failed to obtain satisfaction of its enforceable claims by a levy of
execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to void certain transactions, such as the payment of debt and
the granting of security pursuant to the German Avoidance Act (Anfechtungsgesetz). The conditions for avoidance
under the German Avoidance Act differ to a certain extent from the above described rules under the German
Insolvency Code and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of
avoidance in the courts.

**_Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims_**

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the creditors against the debtor on the
date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied ranking below the
other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the proportion of their amounts if
ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors from
the day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to
their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well
as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offence binding the debtor to pay money;
(iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for restitution of a shareholder
loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such
a loan (unless such loan or corresponding transaction was provided by a state development bank (staatliche
_Förderbank) or one of its subsidiaries and the state development bank (staatliche Förderbank) or its subsidiary is_
a direct or indirect >10% shareholder in the debtor.

The COVInsAG suspends the statutory subordination of shareholder loans and receivables from economically
similar acts in insolvency proceedings applied for by September 30, 2023 for newly granted shareholder loans: (i)
that were granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020; or (ii) were granted between October 1, 2020
and December 31, 2020 if the debtor was over-indebted but not illiquid; or (iii) were granted between January 1,
2021 and April 30, 2021 if the debtor had submitted an application for applicable German state aid between 1
November 2020 and 28 February 2021 (or, if an application was not possible due to legal or actual reasons and
the debtor was otherwise eligible for the applicable German state aid) unless there were no reasonable prospects
to receive the applicable German state aid or if receiving the applicable German state aid would not have been
sufficient to prevent insolvency.

**_Preventive restructuring framework_**

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the proceedings under the Corporate Stabilization and
Restructuring Act (StaRUG).

In transforming the EU directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019 on
preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the
efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU)
2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “EU Restructuring Directive”) was published on June
26, 2019 into national law, the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) has come into force on
January 1, 2021 in Germany. A limited supplement to the Corporate Satbilization and Restructuring Act came
into force on July 7, 2022. The Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for a new pre-insolvency

341


-----

procedure to restructure the liabilities of debtors, whose “centre of main interest” is located in Germany. This may
apply as of the date of this Exchange Offer Memorandum to certain of the Guarantors as well as to the Issuer.

As the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) has only come into force on January 1, 2021, little
corresponding (court) practice exists as of the date of this Exchange Offer Memorandum and consequently any
proceedings under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) come with uncertainty.

For the holders of the New Notes, among the relevant consequences of an initiation of restructuring proceedings
by a Relevant German Entity having its “centre of main interest” in Germany would be in particular the following:

- potentially no or limited court review and/or supervision of the restructuring proceedings;

- any measures (such as reduction in principal and/or interest or deferrals) regulated by the restructuring plan
may be approved within a class of creditors (e.g., the holders of the New Notes) with a majority of 75% of
the claims or by way of a so-called cross-class cram down by other classes under certain presumptions;

- any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to restructuring
proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral; and

- restrictions on individual enforcement actions for all or certain creditors regarding their claims, or, if
applicable, their respective collateral over moveable assets of up to eight months due to a moratorium.

**_Restructuring proceedings_**

Restructuring proceedings may only be initiated by the relevant debtor with a notification of the competent
restructuring court of the commencement of restructuring proceedings. A debtor is eligible to file for restructuring
proceedings if it has become imminently illiquid (drohend zahlungsunfähig). Such imminent illiquidity (drohende
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit) occurs if it is more likely than not that the debtor will be unable to pay its debts as and when_
they fall due within a two years’ look-forward period.

During the restructuring proceedings, the debtor has to observe the duty of a prudent business manager, which
includes safeguarding the best interest of all of the debtor’s creditors. In particular, the debtor has to refrain from
any actions, which cannot be reconciled with or potentially frustrate the restructuring goal (Restrukturierungsziel).
This means that, generally, any claims, which shall be subject to the envisaged restructuring plan, must not be
settled or collateralized during the restructuring proceedings.

During the restructuring proceedings, the duty to file for insolvency without undue delay if the debtor becomes
illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) or over-indebted (überschuldet) is generally suspended. However, if such an insolvency
event occurs, the debtor is obliged to notify the restructuring court accordingly without undue delay. The
restructuring court then abrogates the restructuring proceedings unless, in the restructuring court’s discretion, (i)
the abrogation of the restructuring proceedings is, against the backdrop of the advanced status of restructuring
proceedings, evidently not in the interest of all creditors or (ii) the illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or overindebtedness (Überschuldung) is caused by the enforcement of any such claim that is envisaged to be subject to
the restructuring plan provided the achievement of the restructuring goal (Restrukturierungsziel) remains
predominantly likely. Once restructuring proceedings have been abrogated by the restructuring court, the debtor
is again obliged to file for insolvency under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung).

If (i) the envisaged restructuring also comprises of consumer claims or claims of small or medium enterprises or
respective collateral granted for the benefit of such claims, (ii) the debtor has filed for a moratorium against all or
essentially all creditors or (iii) the envisaged restructuring plan provides for specific supervision of the settlement
of claims subject to the plan, the restructuring court has to appoint a mandatory restructuring officer
(Restrukturierungsbeauftragter). A mandatory restructuring officer is also to be appointed by the restructuring
court if the restructuring goal (Restrukturierungsziel) can predictably only be achieved by a cram-down of
dissenting classes (unless only claims originated by financial institutions and/ or shareholders are to be
compromised).

The restructuring court may appoint as mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) any
person with experience in restructurings and insolvencies who is suitable for the respective individual case and
who is qualified as a tax advisor, accountant, lawyer or has comparable qualifications (an “ Eligible Restructuring
_Officer”); the court may take suggestions by the debtor, creditors or shareholders into account. If (i) the debtor is,_
based on expert opinion provided by an Eligible Restructuring Officer, eligible for a moratorium (see “—
_Moratorium”), or (ii) creditors of one class with at least 25% of the corresponding votes in such class propose a_

342


-----

mandatory restructuring officer, the court may only appoint a mandatory restructuring officer different from the
proposed Eligible Restructuring Officer if the proposed Eligible Restructuring Officer is evidently inadequate. If
a mandatory restructuring officer is appointed based on the proposal of the debtor or a group of creditors, the
restructuring court may appoint an additional mandatory restructuring officer in its own discretion.

The mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) is entitled to decide on the procedure to be
elected for the voting on the restructuring plan and can be empowered by the restructuring court to (i) supervise
the debtor’s board and business situation and (ii) receive payments to and approve payments made by the debtor.
If a moratorium is granted, the mandatory restructuring officer is obliged to monitor that the respective
prerequisites of such moratorium persist and, in case such prerequisites do not persist, entitled to file for a lifting
of such moratorium. Additionally, the mandatory restructuring officer is obliged to comment on the proposed
plan’s prospects to remove the debtor’s imminent illiquidity (drohende _Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and restore the_
debtor’s viability.

The mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) has to perform its duties independently and
the debtor is obliged to share all relevant information with the mandatory restructuring officer. The restructuring
court can remove the mandatory restructuring officer from office for good cause ex officio or, if the mandatory
restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) has not acted independently, on the debtor’s or a creditor’s
petition.

Furthermore, the debtor or at least 25% of creditors in a voting class, can request the appointment of an optional
restructuring officer to facilitate the development and negotiation of a restructuring plan. Creditors may only
request such appointment if they agree to be jointly and severally liable for the costs of the optional restructuring
officer. The optional restructuring officer is only obliged to support the stakeholders involved in the negotiations
of the restructuring plan, but has no further powers. An optional restructuring officer can also be removed from
office by the restructuring court ex officio for good cause or, if the optional restructuring officer has not acted
independently, on the debtor’s or a creditor’s petition.

Prior to a confirmation and implementation of a restructuring plan, the restructuring court may terminate the
restructuring proceedings for certain reasons, e.g., if the debtor notifies the restructuring court of the occurrence
of an insolvency event unless, in the restructuring court’s discretion (taking into account the actual status of the
relevant restructuring proceedings), the opening of formal insolvency proceedings is obviously not in the interest
of the entirety of the creditors or if the debtor files for insolvency or insolvency proceedings are opened over the
assets of the debtor based on a creditor’s filing.

**_Restructuring plan_**

Key element of the restructuring proceedings is the restructuring plan, which can comprise certain selected or all
(with the exception of employees’ claims, including pensions, and claims based on intentionally committed acts
of tort) of the debtor’s liabilities, or amend the terms of financial and other agreements to which more than the
debtor and one other party are parties, including the terms and liabilities relating to the relevant debtor under the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

Any form of financial or operational debt may be compromised, including contingent claims and undue claims,
and relating contractual arrangements including syndicated credit facilities and intercreditor agreements can be
amended by virtue of the plan. Corresponding collateral provided by debtor affiliates (gruppeninterne
_Drittsicherheiten) may also be released and/or granted under a restructuring plan, provided that affected creditors_
are adequately compensated. Consequently, the New Notes or the Note Guarantees could also be subject to a
restructuring plan provided the respective debtor has its “centre of main interest” in Germany.

Further, a restructuring plan may provide for a (partial) debt-to-equity swap or other corporate law measures like
a share-capital increase. Debt-to-equity swaps can be implemented without the shareholders’ consent but require
the willingness of at least certain creditors to equitize their debt claims as no creditor can be forced to take equity
as a consideration under a restructuring plan. Hence, if, the New Notes or the Note Guarantees were subject to a
restructuring plan providing for debt-to-equity swap, single holders of the New Notes could not be forced under
the restructuring plan to take equity in the Issuer or a Guarantor without their respective consent.

The restructuring plan will be voted on by creditors of the debtor and must subsequently be confirmed by the
restructuring court. The vote may take place by way of consent solicitation process or in a (virtual) creditors’
meeting. Creditors will be divided into classes determined on the basis of the respective creditors’ economic

343


-----

interests in the debtor. As a minimum distinction, secured creditors, unsecured creditors, creditors that benefit
from intra-group credit support and subordinated creditors (e.g., shareholders) will form separate classes.

However, also other factors like, e.g., cross-holdings, could be taken into account for class composition. 75% by
value of all claims of one class will be required to approve the plan for such class. There is no numerosity
requirement. Dissenting classes can be crammed down (or up), if

- the class members can be expected to be no worse off under the plan than absent the plan (whereby the
alternative scenario must not necessarily be an in-court insolvent liquidation, but can also be an alternative
out-of-court restructuring on a going concern basis);

- the crammed down (or up) class members receive an adequate share in the economic value created by the
plan; and

- a majority of classes has accepted the plan.

A crammed down (or up) class receives an adequate share in the economic value created by the plan if (i) no other
creditor receives more than its claim’s par value, (ii) no creditors that would rank junior in insolvency proceedings,
the debtor or its shareholders receive any value through the plan which is not covered by a respective stakeholder’s
contribution to the plan and (iii) no creditor that would rank pari passu in insolvency proceedings receives a
preferential treatment compared to the dissenting class under the restructuring plan (unless such preferential
treatment is appropriate (sachgerecht) in light of the individual situation of distress to overcome and the dissenting
class accounts for no more than 50% of the rank’s total claims). However, despite the prerequisite described under
(ii) in the foregoing sentence, a creditor class can also be crammed down in case a shareholder retains equity
without any additional contribution if the shareholder itself is crucial for and bindingly committed to the
continuation of the debtor’s business and the realization of the restructuring plan or the creditors’ rights are only
compromised marginally (e.g., by a maturity extension of no more than 18 months).

Upon the debtor’s decision, either the debtor or the restructuring court can lead the voting on the plan. In case the
voting has been led by the debtor, the restructuring court has to hold a hearing of affected stakeholders before the
plan can be confirmed.

The restructuring court will confirm the plan unless (i) the debtor is not (longer) imminently illiquid (drohend
_zahlungsunfähig), (ii) there is a material breach of statutory provisions regarding the procedure to adopt the_
restructuring plan or its permitted content that cannot or has not been cured upon the restructuring court’s notice,
(iii) claims contemplated by or surviving the restructuring plan can obviously be not satisfied by the debtor or
(iv), if new money financing is contemplated under the restructuring plan, the underlying restructuring concept is
incoherent or appears to be based on incorrect facts or to have no reasonable prospect of success. Additionally,
dissenting creditors can request the restructuring court to reject the restructuring plan if the applicant will be
expectedly worse off under the restructuring plan than without the proposed restructuring plan and the applicant
has already raised such concern in the creditors’ meeting or creditors’ hearing, as applicable. However, such
application has no merits if the restructuring plan provides for funds to be distributed to creditors that can prove
to be worse-off, irrespective of whether any such applicant actually benefits from such funds.

Dissenting creditors can appeal against the restructuring court’s confirmation order of the plan if they are able to
produce prima facie evidence (glaubhaft machen) that they are worse-off under the restructuring plan and funds
provided thereunder to compensate worse-off creditors (if any) will not suffice for their individual compensation.
Such appeal will only have suspensive effect (aufschiebende Wirkung) against the effectiveness of the
restructuring plan if requested by the dissenting creditor and ordered by the court based on serious and irreversible
disadvantages for such dissenting creditor that are not in proportion to the benefits of an immediate
implementation of the restructuring plan.

Restructuring plans, which are negotiated and approved in public proceedings and confirmed by a German
restructuring court in accordance with the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) are included
as a recognized proceeding in Exhibit A of the EU Insolvency Proceedings Regulation (as amended) and will be
recognized in any EU member state pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation. In any other case, the recognition
of the restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable international private law. As
the StaRUG has only come into force on January 1, 2021, any such recognition has to our knowledge not yet been
tested as of the date of this Exchange Offer Memorandum.

344


-----

**_Moratorium_**

In order for the debtor to be able to draw up and negotiate the restructuring plan, the Corporate Stabilization and
Restructuring Act (StaRUG) offers the possibility of having a moratorium ordered by the competent court upon
application by the debtor, which can restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors with regards to their
payment claims or the realization of respective collateral over moveable assets. The moratorium can initially be
ordered for a maximum period of up to three months, with subsequent orders to extend the moratorium up to a
maximum of eight months permissible under certain conditions. Such moratorium may also be sanctioned with
regards to collateral provided by the debtor’s affiliates (gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten). The moratorium does
not suspend the relevant creditor’s interest claims.

However, whereas creditors may still file an insolvency petition against the debtor during a moratorium,
correspondingly initiated insolvency proceedings are suspended for the time of the moratorium. Under certain
conditions, in particular if the requirements to terminate restructuring proceedings are met or the debtor does not
comply with certain statutory duties under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) the
competent court may lift the moratorium, also on a creditor’s application.

**England and Wales**

**_Certain Insolvency Considerations_**

Certain of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors and certain of the providers of Collateral are incorporated under
the laws of England and Wales (the “English Obligors”). Accordingly, any insolvency proceedings with respect
to the English Obligors would be likely to proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency laws.

It is nonetheless possible that insolvency proceedings with respect to an English Obligor could be opened in a
different jurisdiction and be governed by the insolvency laws of that jurisdiction. In particular, while the UK was
a member state of the EU, insolvency processes opened in the UK were subject to both EU and applicable UK
domestic legislation. Following the UK’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the subsequent transition period
(the “Transition Period”) on December 31, 2020, in accordance with the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018
(as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020) EU law as directly applicable in the UK
at the end of the Transition Period (subject to certain exceptions) was transposed into UK domestic law subject to
significant amendments. Accordingly, the United Kingdom is no longer a European member state, including for
the purposes of the EU Insolvency Regulation and Regulation (EU) 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and
of the Council on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters
(the “EU Judgments Regulation”), which have largely been repealed in the United Kingdom (pursuant to The
Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) (as amended) (the “Insolvency Brexit
_Regulations”) and The Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019). The_
Insolvency Brexit Regulations also effected key amendments to domestic insolvency laws, including the
Insolvency Act 1986 (the “Insolvency Act”), the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 (SI 2016/1024) (the
“Insolvency Rules”) and the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) (the “Cross-Border
_Insolvency Regulations”). Accordingly, the United Kingdom is no longer party to the European regime for_
reciprocal recognition of insolvency proceedings or civil/commercial judgments under the EU Insolvency
Regulation or the EU Judgments Regulation, respectively. The prospects of a European member state opening
insolvency proceedings in respect of an English Obligor may vary between member states; the implications of
any such proceedings, including the prospect and implications of recognition in the United Kingdom, would need
to be carefully considered in each case.

For instance, unless insolvency proceedings or certain related proceedings were opened prior to the expiry of the
Transition Period, in which case the unmodified EU Insolvency Regulation and related EU insolvency legislation
govern the proceedings, insolvency proceedings with respect to the English Obligors would likely proceed under,
and be governed by, English insolvency laws in force at the time of commencement of the relevant proceedings.
However, to the extent that an English Obligor has its COMI in a member state of the EU, insolvency proceedings
could, pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation and subject to certain exceptions, be opened in the relevant EU
member state and be subject to the laws of that EU member state (see “European Union” above). In addition,
pursuant to the Cross Border Insolvency Regulations, certain foreign courts may have jurisdiction to oversee
insolvency proceedings of any English Obligor which has its COMI or an “establishment” (being a place of
operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services ) in
such foreign jurisdiction.

345


-----

Although the scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings available in
England and Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect of any
company which has its COMI in the UK or which has its COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) and
an “establishment” in the UK. An “establishment” is defined in the same way as under the EU Insolvency
Regulation (see “European Union” above). While this allows English courts to assume jurisdiction over certain
foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly
depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions
(see “Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings” below).

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors
may be familiar. In the event that the English Obligors experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict
with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings.

English insolvency laws may not be as favorable to investors as United States or other insolvency laws. English
insolvency laws and other limitations on the New Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees may adversely
affect the validity and enforceability of the New Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees against an
English Obligor and may limit that amount that can be recovered under the New Notes or the Senior Secured
Notes Guarantees.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to such certain limitations.
The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees and/or under the Collateral and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may
receive in an insolvency of any of the English Obligors.

**_Administration_**

Under the Insolvency Act, as amended by the Insolvency Brexit Regulations, administration proceedings are
available in respect of any company incorporated in an EEA Member State, in addition to a company registered
under the Companies Act 2006 in England, Wales or Scotland and any company (irrespective of its country of
incorporation) with its COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) or upon request from courts in other
parts of the United Kingdom or certain other countries and territories. In each case and subject to specific
conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely
to become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose
of administration. A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its
debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than
the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), as per Section 123 of
the Insolvency Act. Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a
creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 21 days of service or to satisfy in full or in part a
judgment debt (or similar court order). Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, a company, the
directors of such company or the holder of a qualifying floating charge (for further detail on what constitutes a
qualifying floating charge, see “Qualifying Floating Charge” below) where the floating charge has become
enforceable, may also appoint an administrator through an out of court process, subject to certain exceptions
pursuant to the Insolvency Act. Note that different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor.

The purpose of an administration comprises three objectives, each of which must be considered successively to
determine whether it is reasonable to put the company into administration: rescuing the company as a
going-concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a
whole than would be likely if the company were wound up (without first being in administration) or, if neither of
those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily
harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The
order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (see “Priority of Claims on
_Insolvency” below). An administrator must attempt to achieve the objectives of administration in order, unless_
(s)he thinks it is not reasonably practicable to achieve the primary objective, or that the secondary objective would
achieve a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole. The administrator cannot pursue the third objective
unless (s)he thinks either the first or the second objective is unachievable and that it will not unnecessarily harm
the interests of the creditors of the company as a whole to pursue the third objective.

Certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment
of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed and no step may be taken to enforce security or a guarantee
over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court (although
a demand for payment could be made under a guarantee granted by the company). The same requirements for

346


-----

consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings,
execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will
consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory
objectives of administration described above.

Accordingly, if an English Obligor were to enter into administration, the New Notes and the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantee, as applicable, may not be enforceable while the relevant company was in administration without the
permission of the court or consent of the administrator. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent would obtain
such permission of the court or consent of the administrator.

In addition, an administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements
under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a
floating charge). A set proportion of the proceeds of the realization of any property subject to a floating charge
will need to be set aside for satisfaction of the claims of preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed
Part (see “Prescribed Part” below). An administrator may also, with prior approval by the court, deal with assets
subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the
administration and the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal towards discharging the
obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder.

However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to realize
their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue
of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral agreement” (generally, a
charge over cash or financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and
credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the
“Financial Collateral Regulations”). Accordingly, if any of the English Obligors were to enter administration, it
is possible that, to the extent such security is a financial collateral arrangement, the security granted by it or the
guarantee granted by it would be enforceable while it is in administration without leave of the court or consent of
the administrators.

**_Qualifying Floating Charge_**

If a company grants security constituting a “qualifying floating charge” to a party for the purposes of English
insolvency law, that party will be able to appoint an administrator out of court (see “Administration” above) or
(in limited circumstances) an administrative receiver (see “Administrative Receivership” below). The holder of a
qualifying floating charge is also entitled to advance notice of an intention of a company or its directors to appoint
an administrator, allowing the charge holder to either appoint its own administrator (or, where applicable,
administrative receiver) in place of the proposed administrator, conduct negotiations with the proposed appointors
over the identity or terms of appointment of the proposed administrator or (in an extreme case) prevent the
company going into administration.

In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which:
(a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it (paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 of the Insolvency Act);
(b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company; or (c) purports to empower the
holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. A
party will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary)
with other forms of security granted to that party, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the property
of the relevant company and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Please note that it
is a matter of fact whether the extent of the security granted relates to ‘the whole or substantially the whole’ of
the property of a company and there is no statutory guidance as to what percentage of a company’s assets should
be charged to satisfy this test.

**_Administrative Receivership_**

Administrative receivership as a creditor remedy has been largely abolished and is only available in very limited
circumstances. If a company grants a “qualifying floating charge” to a party for the purposes of English insolvency
law, that party will be able to appoint an administrator using the out of court process. That party will also be able
to appoint an administrative receiver if the qualifying floating charge falls within one of the exceptions under the
Insolvency Act (as amended by the Enterprise Act 2002) to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative
receivers, or if the security document pre-dates 15 September 2003.

347


-----

The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception
relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the
New Notes creates a debt of at least £50 million for the relevant company during the life of the arrangement and
the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, and
generally includes rated, listed or traded debt instruments, and debt instruments designed to be rated, listed or
traded).

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by
the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then
only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security
pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is invalid. If an administrator is appointed, any
administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of part of the company’s property must resign if
required to do so by the administrator.

**_Fixed charge receivership_**

A fixed charge receiver (as opposed to an administrative receiver, who is appointed under certain floating charges

- see “Administrative receivership” above) may be appointed over some or all of the assets secured by a fixed
charge in accordance with the terms of a security document creating a fixed charge or (in limited circumstances)
pursuant to statute under the Law of Property Act 1925, although it is standard market practice to augment the
powers of any receiver appointed through the relevant security document.

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge (such
as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an appointment
to take place. A receivership is not a process pursuant to English insolvency laws as such and a fixed charge
receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator or an administrator. An administrator may require a fixed
charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge which falls within
the definition of a “security financial collateral arrangement”, as per Reg. 8(4) of the Financial Collateral
Regulations (see “Administration” above).

The primary duty of the fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning (s)he
owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor (although the receiver owes the chargor a duty to act in good
faith during the course of his or her appointment). This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs
his or her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary
remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to
take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver
will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the
company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor).

To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be deducted from
the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors (see
“Prescribed Part” below).

**_Liquidation/Winding-up_**

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realized and distributed
by the liquidator to creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency Act (see “Priority of
_Claims on Insolvency” below). There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the_
court and (b) members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the
company’s members. The difference between the two latter proceedings is the solvency of the company in
question; in a members’ voluntary liquidation, the directors of the company swear a statutory declaration as to the
company’s solvency over the following 12 months whereas the primary ground for the creditors’ voluntary
liquidation of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency
Act – see “Administration” above). Note that while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from
administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, but once in place the process is
subject to some degree of control by the creditors. Whereas compulsory liquidation and creditors’ voluntary
liquidation proceedings are available to foreign companies with sufficient nexus to the UK in addition to
companies within the English courts’ general jurisdiction, members’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are only
available to companies registered in England, Wales or Scotland.

348


-----

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a
compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company’s
property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this
will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a
“financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out
netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made
for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced from the time of the presentation
of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the
company will be imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company without
permission of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose although there is no freeze on the
enforcement of security.

In the context of a voluntary winding-up however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up
order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the member’s resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no
equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary
winding-up - it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or shareholder of the company, to apply for a stay to prevent
the continuation of legal proceedings and enforcement of security. This is important because it means secured
creditors can go ahead and enforce their security.

A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business
of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and execute
documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions (see “Avoidance of Transactions”
below).

**_Scheme of Arrangement_**

Although not an insolvency proceeding, a scheme of arrangement is a statutory procedure pursuant to Part 26 of
the Companies Act 2006, which permits a company to enter into an arrangement or compromise with its members
or creditors (or any class of them). The English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that
effects a compromise of a company’s liabilities with respect to its creditors (or any class of its creditors) where
(a) such company is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act and, in the context of a non-English company,
(b) has a “sufficient connection” to the English jurisdiction.

In practice, a non-English company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found
to be satisfied where, among other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents
are English law-governed, or the company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms
to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances
so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not specific circumstances satisfy the requirement for
sufficient connection in any given case.

Before the court considers whether or not to sanction a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the
proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes,
depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that
such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If
a majority in number representing 75 per cent. or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the
meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval
thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be
binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those
who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing at which
the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has discretion as
to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made to the
scheme or decline to sanction the scheme. In exercising its discretion to sanction a scheme of a non-English
Obligor, the court will need to be satisfied that the scheme of arrangement would have substantial effect in the
jurisdictions in which the company has its main assets or operations, in the jurisdictions of any other obligors of
the debt and under the governing law of the affected debt documents (if not English law). This is typically achieved
by providing expert evidence that the scheme of arrangement (or its effect) is likely to be recognized in such
jurisdictions. Once sanctioned, the scheme of arrangement binds all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as
set out in the scheme of arrangement, which shall be effective (in accordance with its terms) upon delivery of the
court’s order sanctioning the scheme of arrangement to the Registrar of Companies.

349


-----

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not automatically
trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings.

Schemes of arrangement have always been outside the scope of the EU Insolvency Regulation on the basis that
they are not considered to be ‘insolvency’ proceedings (although they are, in practice, often used by financially
distressed companies). Instead, if a scheme previously required recognition within the EU, the EU Judgments
Regulation was commonly relied upon as a basis on which recognition of the judgment of the court sanctioning
the scheme could be obtained in each member state.

**_Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020_**

The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (“CIGA”) was enacted on June 25, 2020. CIGA is intended
to improve the ability of companies to be efficiently restructured; it includes the following provisions.

_Restructuring Plan Procedure_

CIGA introduced a new restructuring procedure, similar to a scheme of arrangement but with the added possibility
of cross-class cram-down to bind classes of dissenting stakeholders to the restructuring plan.

Like a scheme of arrangement, a restructuring plan is a procedure under the Companies Act 2006, namely Part
26A of the Companies Act 2006 and is available to any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency
Act.

A restructuring plan procedure may be proposed by the company or other stakeholders (including creditors,
shareholders, administrators or liquidators). As with a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the
proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes
depending on the rights of such creditors which will be affected by the proposed restructuring plan and any new
rights that such creditors are given under the restructuring plan.

The restructuring plan procedure is available as an option to both solvent and insolvent companies; the company
need only show that (a) it has encountered, or be likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or
will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern, and (b) a compromise or arrangement has
been proposed between the company and its creditors (or any class of them) whose purpose it is to eliminate,
reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect of, any of those financial difficulties.

A restructuring plan will be deemed to be approved if at least 75% in value of the creditors present and voting at
the meeting of at least one class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed compromise. There is no requirement
for the approving creditors to constitute a majority in number of those creditors present and voting, and there is
crucially no requirement for each and every voting class to approve the plan, provided that:

(a) the court is satisfied that none of the members of the dissenting class(es) would be any worse off under the
plan than they would be in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’ (being whatever the court considers would be
most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned); and

(b) at least one class of creditors who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the
company, in the event of the relevant alternative has voted in favor of the plan.

By virtue of these mechanics, the restructuring plan process provides for the possibility of a ‘cross-class cramdown’, meaning the court may sanction a restructuring plan even if one or more classes of affected creditors do
not vote in favor of the restructuring plan, effectively allowing the vote of one class of stakeholders to bind other
classes. Following approval of the restructuring plan at the creditor meeting(s), the restructuring plan needs to be
sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review whether the applicable statutory
conditions have been met and may also consider whether the restructuring plan is just and equitable. The court
has discretion as to whether to sanction the restructuring plan as approved, make an order conditional upon
modifications being made or refuse to sanction the restructuring plan. Once sanctioned, the restructuring plan
binds all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the restructuring plan, which shall be effective
(in accordance with its terms) upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the restructuring plan to the Registrar
of Companies.

As with schemes of arrangement, but unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a restructuring
plan does not automatically trigger a moratorium on claims or proceedings.

-----

Stakeholders’ rights following confirmation of a restructuring plan will be as provided for in the plan. If a company
were subsequently to enter an insolvency procedure following a restructuring plan, the rights and claims of any
stakeholders bound by the plan would be as set out in the plan. Any debt forgiveness would therefore be binding
in the subsequent insolvency proceedings.

**_Priority of Claims on Insolvency_**

One of the primary functions of liquidation (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going-concern, one
of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets of the insolvent company
and to distribute the cash realizations made from those assets to its creditors. Under the Insolvency Act and the
Insolvency Rules, creditors are placed into different classes, with proceeds from the realization of the insolvent
company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed
Part (as defined below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the
creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company,
distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to
each creditor within a class.

Contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or administration are only
respected to the extent they fall within the definition of “mutual dealing” as applied by the mandatory insolvency
set-off regime. This regime sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of
their mutual dealings, and only the resulting net balance is either provable by the creditor in the administration or
liquidation of the company (if amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the
company (if amounts remain due to the company).

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

- _First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent the value of the secured assets_
cover that indebtedness);

- _Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate incurred during the relevant insolvency proceedings_
(there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are-paid);

- _Third ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors._

Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to:
(a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done
in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; and (c) holiday pay due to
any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of
insolvency.

Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of ordinary preferential debts and include claims
by HM Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including
student loan repayments), employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but
excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees
and customers. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally after the ordinary preferential
debts;

- _Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, to the extent of the realizations from those secured_
assets, according to the priority of their security. This would include any security interest that was stated
to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on a proper interpretation by the court,
was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating
charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for
distribution to unsecured creditors;

- _Fifth ranking: firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and any secured creditor to the extent of any_
remaining debt due to it (a shortfall), in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts
up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors
any shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets, as secured
creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is
sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors or the secured creditor elects to surrender its security;

351


-----

- secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the official
rate in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in respect of any period after
the commencement of liquidation, or after the commencement of any administration which had been
converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due
under the New Notes or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the
New Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such
security recoveries; and

- thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and
therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully repaid. This however
does not include “currency conversion” claims following the English Supreme Court Lehman Brothers
ruling dated May 17, 2017; and

- _Sixth ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds_
exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination
language in the relevant documentation.

**_Prescribed Part_**

An insolvency officeholder of the company (e.g., administrator, administrative receiver or liquidator) will
generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security
for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of
floating charge realizations) (the “Prescribed Part”). Under current law, this ring-fence applies to 50 per cent. of
the first £10,000 of floating charge realizations and 20 per cent. of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum
aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder
of a first ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is
£600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would
be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors. The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall
claims of secured creditors. Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and other security will
constitute substantially the whole of the relevant English Obligors’ assets at the time that the floating charges are
enforced will be a question of fact at the time.

The requirement of the insolvency officeholder to set aside a Prescribed Part will not apply to any charge created
or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations.

**_Challenges to Guarantees and Security_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of security
and/or guarantees, or the entry by an English company into a transaction can be challenged. In most cases, this
will only arise if the company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period after the
granting of the security and/or guarantee. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator
is appointed to an English company, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or
guarantee given by such company, or certain transactions entered into by the company. The Issuer cannot be
certain that, in the event that the onset of an English Obligor’s insolvency (as described below) is within any of
the requisite time periods, the grant of a security interest and/or guarantee in respect of the New Notes would not
be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid.

**_Onset of Insolvency_**

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid
floating charges (as discussed below), depends on the insolvency procedure in question.

In an administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an administration
order is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c) otherwise, the date
on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect.

In a compulsory liquidation the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court,
whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes a winding-up resolution. Where liquidation
follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be the same as for the initial administration.

352


-----

**_Connected Persons_**

If the given transaction at an undervalue, preference, or invalid floating charge has been entered into by the
company with a “connected person,” then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any
challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set out below).

A “connected person” of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of transactions at
an undervalue, preferences or invalid floating charges is a party who is: (a) a director of the company; (b) a shadow
director; (c) an associate of such director or shadow director; or (d) an associate of the relevant company.

A party is associated with an individual if they are: (a) a relative of the individual; (b) the individual’s husband,
wife or civil partner; (c) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (d) the husband, wife or civil
partner of a relative of the individual; or (e) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual’s
husband, wife or civil partner.

A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company.

A company is associated with another company if (a) the same person has control of both companies, (b) a person
has control of one and persons who are his or her associates, or (s)he and persons who are his or her associates,
have control of the other or (c) if a group of two or more persons has control of each company, and the groups
either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or
more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom (s)he is an associate.

A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company
which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his or her directions or
instructions, or (s)he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any
general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons
together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company.

The potential grounds for challenge available under the English insolvency legislation that may apply to any
security interest or guarantee granted by an English Obligor include, without limitation, the following described
below.

**_Transactions at an Undervalue_**

Under Section 238 of the Insolvency Act, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order to set
aside a transaction, for example the creation of a security interest or a guarantee, (or give such other relief as the
court thinks fit for restoring the position to what it otherwise would have been) where the creation of such security
interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. It will only be a transaction at an undervalue if at
the time of the transaction, or as a consequence of the transaction, the company is unable to pay its debts or
becomes unable to pay its debts as a result (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can
be challenged if the company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two years
ending with the onset of insolvency from the date of the transaction. A transaction may be set aside as a transaction
at an undervalue if the company made a gift to a person, if the company received no consideration or if the
company received consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration
given by such company.

However, a court shall not make an order if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good
faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds
for believing the transaction would benefit the company. If the court determines that the transaction was a
transaction at an undervalue, the court shall make such order as it thinks fit to restore the company to the position
it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under or
setting aside security interests or guarantees. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to
demonstrate that the company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected
person, in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate the
solvency of the company in such proceedings. See “Connected Persons” above.

An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on,
any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction, but such an
order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good
faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who

353


-----

received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator
of the company, except where the person was a party to the transaction.

**_Preference_**

Under Section 239 of the Insolvency Act, a liquidator or administrator of a company could apply to the court for
an order to set aside a transaction, for example the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or give such other
relief as the court thinks fit for restoring the position to what it otherwise would have been) where the creation of
such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. It will only be a preference if the company is
unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction or becomes unable to pay its debts as a result (as defined in
Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the company enters into liquidation or
administration proceedings within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not
a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person, except where such beneficiary is a
connected person by reason only of being the company’s employee) from the date the company gives the
preference ending with the onset of insolvency. A transaction may constitute a preference if it has the effect of
putting a creditor of the company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better
position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety
would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. However, for the court to determine a
preference, it must be shown that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect. If the
court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the
company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction.

In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was unable to pay its
debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor, unless the beneficiary of
the transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of
being the company’s employee), in which case it is presumed that the company intended to put that person in a
better position and the connected person must demonstrate that there was, in fact, no such influence. An order by
the court for a preference may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not (s)he
is the person to whom the preference was given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which
was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith, for value without notice of the relevant
circumstances, or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received
a benefit from the preference in good faith, for value without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay a sum to
the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given
to that person at a time when (s)he was a creditor of the company.

**_Transactions Defrauding Creditors_**

Under Section 423 of the Insolvency Act, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue, and the
court is satisfied that it was made for the substantial purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who
is making, or may make, a claim against the company in question, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a
person in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make, and one or more of the criteria set out
in the applicable provisions of the Insolvency Act is satisfied the transaction may be set aside by the court as a
transaction defrauding creditors. This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the
transaction (and is not therefore limited to liquidators or administrators) and, subject to certain conditions, the UK
Financial Conduct Authority, the UK Prudential Regulation Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator (with the
leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration). There is no statutory time limit under English
insolvency legislation within which the challenge must be made (subject to the normal statutory limitation periods)
and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of, or as a result of, the transaction.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders
as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and
to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under the
relevant notes or setting aside security interests or guarantees. The relevant court order may affect the property
of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not (s)he is the person with whom the transaction was
entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a
third-party in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not require a person
who received a benefit from such transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant
circumstances to pay any sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company unless such person was a party to
the transaction.

354


-----

**_Extortionate Credit Transactions_**

An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. A credit
transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of
it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain
contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of
fair dealing. It is presumed, unless otherwise proved by the person extending the credit, that a transaction with
respect to which an administrator or liquidator makes an application to set aside an extortionate credit transaction
is extortionate. The court can make an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by a
company up to three years before the day on which a company entered administration or liquidation. That order
may set aside, either in whole or in part, any obligation created by the transaction (which could include obligations
of sureties). It may also vary the terms of the transaction or the terms of any security for the purposes of the
transaction. The court may require any party to the transaction to repay to the liquidator or administrator sums
already paid under the transaction and it may order the surrender of any security held for the purpose of the
transaction. It should be noted that there are no provisions for the protection of third parties who acquire interests
in the extortionate credit transaction (e.g. assignees of the benefit of the transaction from the person who provided
credit under it).

**_Avoidance of Floating Charges_**

Under Section 245 of the Insolvency Act, floating charges created by a company within a period of one year prior
to the onset of the company’s insolvency (or two years in the case of a floating charge created in favor of a
connected person) at a time when the company was unable to pay its debts or became unable to do so as a
consequence of the transaction, will be invalid, except to the extent of the value of: (a) the money paid to; (b) the
goods or services supplied to; or (c) any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant company at the same
time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest) (the “Consideration”). The floating charge
will not be invalid if, at the time it was created, the company was solvent and did not become insolvent as a result;
however, this exception will not apply if the person in favor of whom it was created is connected.

An administrator or liquidator (as applicable) does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating
charge is invalid by operation of law. Any floating charge created during the relevant time period is automatically
invalid, except to the extent of the value of the Consideration. A liquidator or administrator can inform the relevant
floating charge holder that it considers the charge to be invalid (or only partly valid as regards new consideration).
This may prompt the floating charge holder to seek to enforce the charge (which would then likely trigger an
application from the office holder for a court declaration that the charge is invalid) or seek a court declaration as
to its validity.

If the floating charge constitutes a “security financial collateral agreement” under the Financial Collateral
Regulations then the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in “Administration” above.

**_Fixed Versus Floating Charges_**

The Senior Secured Notes Guarantees benefit from fixed and floating charge security over certain Collateral
owned by the English Obligors. Until floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets
that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be
effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third-party good title to the assets free of the
floating charge.

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security, namely:
(a) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against a floating charge
over the same charged assets (provided that the floating charge has not crystallized at the time the fixed charge
was granted and there were no restrictions on the creation of such security which the fixed charge holder was
aware of); (b) general costs and expenses (including the remuneration of the insolvency office-holders and the
costs of continuing to operate the business of the charging company while in administration) properly incurred in
a winding-up or administration are generally payable out of the assets of the charging company (including the
assets (including cash) that are the subject of the floating charge) and insolvency office-holders appointed to a
charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash to meet such general costs and
expenses in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder to the extent that the value of the charging
company’s unsecured assets is not sufficient to cover such costs and expenses in full (the same does not apply to
fixed charge assets); (c) as mentioned above, until the floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled
to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business; (d) there are

355


-----

particular insolvency “clawback” risks in relation to floating charge security; (e) floating charge security is subject
to the claims of certain preferential creditors (such as employee salary claims (up to a cap per employee), employee
holiday claims and certain unpaid pension contributions) where the floating charge is not a security financial
collateral arrangement and subject to the ring fencing of the Prescribed Part for unsecured creditors; and (f) an
administrator may dispose of or take action relating to property subject to a floating charge without the prior
consent of the charge holder or court but the floating charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the
proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the floating charge. Only with prior approval of the court can
an administrator deal with property subject to a fixed charge provided that disposing of the property is likely to
promote the administration’s purpose and that the administrator apply the gross proceeds from the disposal of the
property in question towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge holder.

There is a possibility under English law that a court could find that some or all of the fixed security interests
expressed to be created by the security documents governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges
as the description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security
interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than recharacterized as floating security interests will
depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the chargor’s
ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the
security holder in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported
fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the
security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed
charge.

If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests: (a) the proceeds of those assets
could be applied in meeting other liabilities of the company in priority to the claims of the purported fixed charge
holder in insolvency proceedings and (b) it is possible that any purported floating charge security may no longer
relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant company and therefore may not
constitute a “qualifying floating charge.” See also “Administrative Receivership.”

**_Disclaimer_**

An English liquidator has the power to disclaim onerous property, which is any unprofitable contract or other
property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform
any other onerous act, by serving the prescribed notice on the relevant party. A contract may be unprofitable if it
gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on a company that may be
detrimental to creditors. A contract will not be unprofitable merely because it is financially disadvantageous or
because the company could have made, or could make, a better bargain. However, this power to disclaim onerous
property does not apply to an executed contract nor can it, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing
the company from any liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person. Any person suffering loss or
damage in consequence of the operation of the disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company and may
prove for the loss or damage in the winding-up. The critical feature is that the performance of future obligations
would prejudice the liquidator’s obligation to realize the assets and make a distribution to creditors.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

The grant of a Guarantee or Collateral by the English Obligors in respect of the obligations of another group
company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the
respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that these documents do not allow
such an action, there is a risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void
and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third-parties if they are
dealing with the English Obligors in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its
interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English Obligor in question with respect to
its entry into entering the proposed transaction must be of corporate benefit for the English Obligors. Section 172
of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that (s)he considers, in good faith, would
be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors
enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to have abused
their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of
the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act
in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when directors’
duties to creditors arise, the English courts have held that the shift takes place when the directors know, or should
know, that the company in question is or is likely to become insolvent, with “likely” in this context meaning
“probable.”

356


-----

Under the Companies Act 2006, subject to limited exceptions, any security (including security not governed by
English law) granted by a company incorporated in England and Wales (together with prescribed particulars of
the security constituted thereby) must be received by the Registrar of Companies for registration within 21-days
after the date of creation of the security constituted by the applicable security document. Such security, if not
registered within the 21-day period, will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator or a creditor of
the company. When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is
deemed to become immediately payable.

In the event that the relevant security document is not registered, the company may be required to enter into a new
security document and register it with Companies House within 21 days of its creation.

In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order allowing the charge to be
registered after the 21-day period has expired. An application for such an order can be made by the company or
by any person interested in the relevant security. The court will grant leave to register the security out of time if
it considers it “just and expedient” to do so, and will have particular regard to whether the failure to register was
merely accidental and whether a late registration will prejudice the position of creditors or shareholders. The court
order will have to be enclosed with any delayed application for registration of the security.

The Financial Collateral Regulations exempt certain charges over financial collateral from registration with the
Registrar of Companies. Security granted by non-English companies over assets in England and Wales does not
need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies (although they may still need to be registered with the
applicable asset registry).

Guarantees and security granted by a company are also subject to limitations to the extent they would result in
unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of the Companies Act 2006.

**_Moratoriums_**

As outlined above, certain of the insolvency processes available in England and Wales provide for the automatic
or optional moratorium imposing a period of time during which third parties including creditors are unable to
institute or continue legal action against the company, enforce certain rights and/or call upon security or
guarantees. Besides the moratorium available to companies undergoing administration (see “Administration”
above), moratoriums are also available to companies entering liquidation (see “Liquidation/winding-up” above).

**_Foreign Currency_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their debts, the
office-holder must convert all foreign currency denominated proofs of debt into sterling at a single rate for each
currency determined by the office-holder by reference to the exchange rates prevailing at the date when the
company went into liquidation or administration. This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. If
a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court; if, on hearing the application, the
court finds that the rate is unreasonable, it may itself determine the rate.

Accordingly, in the event that an English Obligor enters liquidation or administration, holders of the relevant notes
may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date on which the English Obligor enters into liquidation or
administration and receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the relevant notes may become entitled. Any
losses resulting from currency fluctuations are not recoverable from the insolvent estate.

**_Reliance on Ipso Facto Clauses Restricted_**

CIGA inserted a new permanent measure for the protection of supplies of goods and services into the Insolvency
Act. The measure provides that a provision of a contract for the supply of goods or services which permits the
supplier to terminate the contract or the supply, or do any other thing (e.g. impose amended terms), on the grounds
that the counterparty becomes subject to a relevant insolvency procedure, will be void. A relevant insolvency
procedure for this purpose includes winding-up proceedings, administration, the standalone moratorium and the
new restructuring plan procedure, but not a scheme of arrangement.

Other rights to terminate under the contract (i.e. other than as a result of the counterparty being subject to a relevant
insolvency procedure) are preserved, to the extent the termination event arises after commencement of the
insolvency proceeding. A supplier may be allowed to terminate the contract if the company or the relevant
insolvency practitioner consents or if permission is granted by the court on it being satisfied that the continuation
of the contract would cause the supplier hardship.

Certain exclusions apply, including for contracts involving financial services (which includes contracts for the
provision of financial services consisting of lending and contracts for the purchase or sale of a security).

**_Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings_**

_General position_

The recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings in other jurisdictions is governed by
applicable treaties in respect of the mutual recognition (or otherwise) of courts’ jurisdiction, proceedings and
judgments and general principles of private international law such as comity and conflicts of laws rules applicable
in the relevant jurisdictions.

One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the “Model
_Law”), which has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States and Great Britain, where_
it was implemented by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations. The Model Law provides for recognition of
certain British insolvency proceedings in other signatory states as either foreign main proceedings (if the COMI
of the relevant debtor is determined to be in Great Britain) or foreign non-main proceedings (if the COMI is
determined to be in another jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in Great Britain) upon application by
the relevant insolvency officeholder. The nature and scope of the recognition will depend on the way that the
Model Law has been implemented into the domestic law of the jurisdiction in question. Conversely, the CrossBorder Insolvency Regulations provide for recognition in the UK of foreign insolvency proceedings as either main
proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in the jurisdiction where the debtor has its COMI) or non-main
proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in a jurisdiction in which the debtor has only an establishment).

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement, which are
restructuring rather than insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the
jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention
on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 (the “Hague Convention”) and the Lugano Convention 2007 (the “Lugano
_Convention”) (subject to the UK’s pending application to accede to the latter) where these apply. In addition,_
recognition may still be available under principles of private international law and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008
of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations
(“Rome I”).

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans is a developing area of
law. It remains to be seen whether restructuring plans will fall within the scope of treaties regarding matters
relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague
Convention and the Lugano Convention, or whether they will be treated more akin to insolvency and restructuring
proceedings and fall within related exceptions to such treaties.

_Recognition in the EU_

Following the UK’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the Transition Period, UK proceedings no longer
benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in EU member states. As the trade and cooperation terms
agreed between the EU and the UK do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of
UK insolvency procedures across the EU (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border
insolvencies involving the UK and one or more EU member states will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and
increased complexity.

Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more problematic for UK
restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU member states and for UK office holders to
effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. The general position outlined above will apply and
recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant EU member state and the
need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in
cases where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than
COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be recognized in other EU member states. To the
extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of contract law, Rome I may offer an alternative
basis for recognition in EU member states.

As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the EU member
states may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the UK was a member state
of the EU. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be recognized and
whether investors may be adversely affected as a result. For instance, although some member states have their

358


-----

own laws, or bilateral treaties with the UK, that might enable recognition of an English scheme, the number of
these states is limited and the application of these laws and treaties to schemes is untested.

**The Netherlands**

**_Dutch Insolvency Law_**

One of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors is incorporated in The Netherlands. Any insolvency proceeding
concerning such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor would likely be based on Dutch insolvency law under the EU
Insolvency Regulation. Under certain circumstances, bankruptcy proceedings may also be opened in The
Netherlands in accordance with Dutch law over the assets of companies that are not incorporated under Dutch
law.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Dutch insolvency law. There are three primary insolvency
regimes under Dutch law: the first, moratorium of payments (surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the
reorganization of a debtor’s indebtedness and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. The second,
bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate assets and distribute the proceeds of the assets of a
debtor to its creditors. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet).
The third is a statutory composition proceeding, which is also intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s
debts and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern. In practice, a suspension of payments often results in
bankruptcy. A general description of the principles of these insolvency regimes is set out below.

_Suspension of Payments_

An application for a moratorium of payments can only be made by the debtor itself, if it foresees that it will be
unable to continue to pay its payable debts. Once the request for a moratorium of payments is filed, a court will
immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional moratorium and appoint an administrator (bewindvoerder). A meeting
of creditors is required to decide on the definitive moratorium. If a draft composition (ontwerpakkoord) is filed
simultaneously with the application for a moratorium of payments, the court can order that the composition will
be processed before a decision about a definitive moratorium.

If the composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional moratorium
ends. The definitive moratorium will generally be granted unless a qualified minority (more than one quarter of
the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one third of the number
of creditors represented at such creditors’ meeting) of the unsecured non-preferential creditors withholds its
consent. The granting of a definitive moratorium can also be withheld if there is a valid fear that the debtor will
try to prejudice the creditors during a moratorium of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be
able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future.

The moratorium of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non-preferential creditors. Unlike Chapter
11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, during which both secured and unsecured creditors are generally
barred from seeking to recover on their claims during a moratorium of payments, under Dutch law secured and
preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their rights against assets of the
company in moratorium of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were no moratorium of payments. A
recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that does not reflect the going concern value
of the debtor. However, at the request of an interested party the court can order a “cooling down period”
(afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of two months (which can be extended by the court once for another
period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred. Also in
a definitive moratorium of payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to creditors. A composition will be
binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority of the number of
creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are
acknowledged and admitted in the moratorium, and (ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court.
Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the noteholders to effect a
restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Existing Notes in a Dutch moratorium of payments
proceeding. Interest payments that fall due after the date on which a moratorium of payments is granted, cannot
be claimed in a composition.

_Bankruptcy_

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. The bankruptcy can be
requested by a creditor of a claim when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the aforementioned

359


-----

claims (of the bankruptcy requesting creditor or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. The debtor can
also request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself.

During a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding, the assets of a debtor are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed
to the debtor’s creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. The general principle
of Dutch insolvency law is the paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment), which means that all creditors
have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings shall be distributed in proportion
to the size of their respective claims. However, certain creditors (such as secured creditors and tax and social
security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the rights of other creditors. Consequently,
Dutch insolvency laws could reduce your potential recovery in a Dutch bankruptcy proceeding.

The claim of a creditor may be limited depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in accordance
with its terms. Generally, claims of the noteholders that were not due and payable by their terms on the date of a
bankruptcy of the relevant Dutch Guarantor will be accelerated and become due and payable as of that date. Each
of these claims will have to be submitted to the bankruptcy receiver (curator) to be verified. “Verification” under
Dutch law means that the receiver determines the value of the claim and whether and to what extent it will be
admitted in the bankruptcy of the company for the purpose of the distribution of the proceeds. The valuation of
claims that otherwise would not have been payable at the time of the bankruptcy proceeding may be based on a
net present value analysis. Interest payments that fall due after the date of the bankruptcy cannot be verified. The
existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the noteholders may be challenged in the Dutch
bankruptcy proceeding. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatievergadering), the bankruptcy receiver, the
insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may dispute the verification of claims of other creditors. Creditors whose
claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors’ meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings
(renvooiprocedure). These procedures could cause noteholders to recover less than the principal amount of their
Existing Notes or less than they could recover in a U.S. liquidation proceeding. Such renvoi proceedings could
also cause payments to the noteholders to be delayed compared with holders of undisputed claims. As in
moratorium of payments proceedings, in the bankruptcy of a company a composition may be offered to creditors,
which shall be binding on unsecured non-preferential creditors if it is approved by (i) a simple majority in number
of the creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the claims that are
acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii) subsequently confirmed by the court. Remaining proceeds, if
any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the unsecured nonpreferential creditors, who will be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual subordination may to a certain extent
be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. The actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination
is construed.

Secured creditors may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor to satisfy their claims under a Dutch
bankruptcy as if there is no bankruptcy. As in moratorium of payments proceedings the supervisory judge
(rechtercommissaris) can order a “cooling down period” for a maximum of two months (which can be extended
once for another period of two months) during which enforcement actions by secured creditors are barred unless
such creditors have obtained leave for enforcement from the supervisory judge. Furthermore, a bankruptcy
receiver can force a secured creditor to enforce its security interest within a reasonable period of time, failing
which the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have to share in
the general costs of the bankruptcy, which can be significant. Excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned
to the bankruptcy estate; they may not be set-off against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor in the
bankruptcy. An exception applies in the case of set-off relating to a payment to the pledgor, not made during its
bankruptcy and if there are no other pledgees or other holders of limited rights other than the pledgee, although a
set-off prior to bankruptcy may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance or bad faith in
obtaining the claim used for set-off. Moreover, to the extent that Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a
debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the
obligations of a Third-party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a Third-party’s obligations,
enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having a similar effect)
can be challenged in an insolvency proceeding or otherwise and may be nullified by any of its creditors or its
trustee in bankruptcy. See below “—Fraudulent Transfer.”

Under Dutch law, as soon as a debtor is declared bankrupt, in principle, all pending executions of judgments
against such debtor, as well as all attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect to secured creditors
and certain other creditors, as described above), will be terminated by operation of law. Simultaneously with the
opening of the bankruptcy, a bankruptcy receiver will be appointed. The proceeds resulting from the liquidation
of the bankruptcy estate may not be sufficient to satisfy unsecured creditors under the guarantees granted by an
insolvent guarantor after the secured and the preferential creditors have been satisfied. In principle, litigation
pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed.

_Dutch Scheme_

With the implementation in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act and the entry into force of the Act on Court Confirmation
of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans (Wet homologatie onderhands akkoord) (“WHOA”) on January 1, 2021,
debtors now have the possibility to offer a composition outside of formal insolvency proceedings. The WHOA is
inspired on the UK Scheme of Arrangements and the US Chapter 11 procedure and it offers debtors additional
possibilities to restructure their debt. Unlike a composition in moratorium of payments and in bankruptcy
proceedings, a composition under the WHOA can be offered to secured creditors as well as shareholders. The
WHOA provides, inter alia, for cross class cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations through
aligned proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts, the suspension of certain ipso facto clauses in contracts
and supporting court measures. A WHOA composition may result in claims against a Dutch Guarantor being
compromised if the relevant majority votes in favor of such a composition and it is subsequently confirmed by
the Dutch courts. A composition plan under the WHOA can extend to claims against entities that are not
incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside the Netherlands. Accordingly, the WHOA can affect the
rights of the New Notes Trustee and/ or the holders of the New Notes under the New Notes Indenture and therefore
the New Notes.

Voting on a WHOA composition plan is done in classes. A class is deemed to accept the plan if two third of the
total amount of the debt of that class or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two thirds of the share capital of
that class, participating in the vote, votes in favor. The WHOA provides for the possibility for a composition plan
to be binding on a dissenting class (i.e., cross class cramdown). Under the WHOA, the court will confirm a
composition plan if at least one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to
receive a distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a statutory ground
for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of (i) a request by a
dissenting creditor, if the value of the distribution that such creditor receives under the plan is lower than the
distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of a dissenting
creditor in a dissenting class, if the plan provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or
contractual ranking and priority to the detriment of that class, unless there is a reasonable ground to do so. There
is one mandatory refusal ground specifically applicable to secured financial creditors. If the composition plan
entails a debt-for-equity swap to which such creditors do not want to ascribe, and these creditors do not have the
right to opt for a different kind of distribution, the court will refuse confirmation of such plan on the request of
such creditor.

Under the WHOA, the court may grant a stay on enforcement of a maximum of 4 months, with a possible extension
of 4 months. For the duration of such moratorium, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession
of) the debtor is suspended unless with the court’s approval, including action to enforce security over the assets
of the debtor or, in case of an undisclosed right of pledge over receivables, the collection, or notification to the
debtors. Furthermore, any petitions for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor are suspended and the court may lift
attachments on the debtor’s assets at the request of the debtor or restructuring expert.

**_Limitations on Enforcement_**

If a Dutch private limited liability company or public limited liability company grants a guarantee or security
interest and that guarantee or security interest is not in the company’s corporate interest, the guarantee or security
interest may be nullified by the relevant Dutch company, its bankruptcy receiver (curator) in bankruptcy
(faillissement) and its administrator (bewindvoerder) in moratorium of payment proceedings (surseance van
_betaling) or otherwise and, as a consequence, not be valid, binding and enforceable against it. In determining_
whether the granting of a guarantee or security interest is in the interest of a Dutch company, Dutch courts would
not only consider the text of the objects clause in the articles of association (statuten) of the company but all
relevant circumstances, including (i) whether the company irrespective of the wording of the objects clause derives
certain commercial benefits from the transaction in respect of which the guarantee or security interest was granted
and (ii) the balance between the risk that the company is assuming and the benefit it derives from such transaction.
In addition, if it is determined that there are no, or insufficient, commercial benefits from the transactions for the
company that grants the guarantee, then such company (and any bankruptcy receiver) may challenge the
enforcement of the guarantee or security interest, and it is possible that such challenge would be successful. Such
benefit may, according to Dutch case law, consist of an indirect benefit derived by the company as a consequence
of the interdependence of such company with the group of companies to which it belongs. In addition, it is relevant
whether, as a consequence of the granting of the guarantee or security interest, the continuity of such company
would foreseeably be endangered by the granting of such guarantee or security interest. It remains possible that
even if such strong financial and commercial interdependence exists, the transaction may be declared void if it
appears that the granting of the guarantee or security interest cannot serve the realization of the relevant company’s

361


-----

objects or where it is determined that there is a material imbalance to the disadvantage of the company between
the commercial benefit on the one hand and the risks on the other hand. The above also applies with respect to
any security interest granted or other legal act entered into by a Dutch company.

If Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security governed by Dutch law may be voided by a court, if the document
was executed through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or
mistake (dwaling) of a party to the agreement contained in that document. Payment pursuant to a guarantee or
following enforcement or foreclosure of security granted may, regardless of an insolvency situation occurring or
not, also be withheld due to unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden), force majeure (niet
_toerekenbare tekortkoming) or reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid). Other impeding factors_
include dissolution (ontbinding) of contract and set-off (verrekening).

In addition, a guarantee issued by a Dutch company and a security interest provided by a Dutch company may be
suspended (schorsen) by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer van
_het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the motion of the holder or holders of 10% or more of the shares in such_
company, as well as on the motion of a trade union and of other entities entitled thereto in the articles of association
of the relevant Dutch company. Likewise, the guarantee or security itself may be upheld by the Enterprise
Chamber, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or avoided.

According to Dutch case law, a director (bestuurder) of a company acts wrongfully against a creditor of the
company if he has entered into commitments on behalf of that company, while he knew or reasonably ought to
understand that the company would not, or not within a reasonable period of time, be able to meet its obligations
and would not provide sufficient opportunity for recourse for the detriment that the creditor would suffer on the
basis thereof. The foregoing is subject to any circumstances raised by the director on the basis of which the
conclusion is justified that he personally cannot be blamed sufficiently (voldoende ernstig verwijt) for the
detriment suffered.

**_Parallel Debt_**

Under Dutch law, it is uncertain whether security interests can be granted to a party other than the creditor of the
claim which is purported to be secured by such security interests. For that reason, the Intercreditor Agreement
provides for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”)
mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards
the holders of the New Notes under or in connection with the New Notes Indenture, and a pledge under any Dutch
share pledge will be granted to the Security Agent to secure only the Parallel Debt. The parallel debt concept has
not been tested in Dutch courts, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of
unenforceability of a Dutch share pledge posed by Dutch law.

To the extent that the validity or enforceability of a Dutch share pledge is successfully challenged, holders of the
New Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of a Dutch share pledge.
In addition, the holders of the New Notes bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of
the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

**_Fraudulent Transfer_**

To the extent that Dutch law applies, a guarantee or security interest granted by a legal entity may, under certain
circumstances, be nullified by any of its creditors, if (i) the guarantee or security interest was granted without prior
existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) the creditor(s) concerned was/were prejudiced as a
consequence of the guarantee or the granting of the security interest and (iii) at the time the guarantee or security
interest was granted both the legal entity and, unless the guarantee or security interest was granted for no
consideration (om niet), the beneficiary of the guarantee or security interest knew or should have known that one
or more of the entities’ creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced (actio pauliana). Also to the extent that
Dutch insolvency law applies, a guarantee or security interest may be nullified by the bankruptcy receiver
(curator) on behalf of and for the benefit of all creditors of the insolvent debtor, and in such case the beneficiary
of the guarantee or security interest is presumed (subject to evidence to the contrary) to have known that creditors
of the debtor would be prejudiced if the bankruptcy follows within a year of the granting and for no consideration.
The foregoing requirements for invoking fraudulent transfer outside of a bankruptcy apply mutatis mutandis when
invoking fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the bankruptcy receiver may challenge
the guarantee or security interest if it was granted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so
(verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the guarantee or security interest was granted at a time that the beneficiary of
such guarantee or security interest knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed or (ii) if such guarantee or

362


-----

security interest was granted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the beneficiary of such guarantee
or security interest with a view to give preference to the beneficiary over the debtor’s other creditors.
Consequently, the validity of any guarantees or security interests granted by a Dutch legal entity may be
challenged and it is possible that such challenge would be successful.

It is not certain and has not been determined in published case law whether a right of pledge on shares can be
created in advance of the acquisition of the shares by the pledgor. If a security right is created on collateral to
which a Dutch company has not yet obtained a legally valid title, such collateral will not be subject to such a
security interest if that company is declared bankrupt or granted a moratorium of payments prior to obtaining title
thereto.

It is not possible to conduct searches in respect of any Dutch law governed security (other than, if created, in
respect of rights of mortgage), with the exception of any pledge created on the shares in a Dutch private limited
liability company which should be registered in its shareholders’ register. However, this does not constitute
conclusive evidence of the absence of any preexisting security.

**Republic of Ireland**

**_Insolvency_**

One of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors is incorporated under the laws of Ireland (“RoI”) and has its registered
office in Ireland (the “RoI Guarantor”). Under the EU Insolvency Regulation, the RoI Guarantor’s centre of main
interest (“COMI”) is presumed to be the place of its registered office (i.e. Ireland) in the absence of proof to the
contrary and provided that the RoI Guarantor did not move its registered office within the three months prior to a
request to open insolvency proceedings.

As the RoI Guarantor’s COMI is presumed to be Ireland, any main insolvency proceedings in respect of the
relevant RoI Guarantor would fall within the jurisdiction of the courts of Ireland. As to what might constitute
“proof to the contrary” regarding the location of a company’s COMI, the key decision is that in Re Eurofood IFSC
Ltd ((2004) 4 IR 370 (Irish High Court); (2006) IESC 41 (Irish Supreme Court); (2006) Ch 508; ECJ Case C
341/04 (European Court of Justice)), given in respect of the equivalent provision in the previous EU Insolvency
Regulation (Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000). In that case, on a reference from the Irish Supreme Court, the
European Court of Justice concluded that “factors which are both objective and ascertainable by third parties”
would be needed to demonstrate that a company’s actual situation is different from that which the location of its
registered office is deemed to reflect. For instance, if a company with its registered office in Ireland does not carry
on any business in Ireland, that could rebut the presumption that the company’s COMI is in Ireland. However, if
a company with its registered office in Ireland does carry on business in Ireland, the fact that its economic choices
are controlled by a parent undertaking in another jurisdiction would not, of itself, be sufficient to rebut the
presumption.

If the RoI Guarantor’s COMI was found to be in another EU jurisdiction and not in Ireland, main insolvency
proceedings would be opened in that jurisdiction instead.

RoI insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a guarantee provided by the RoI
Guarantors and any security interests granted by the RoI Guarantor.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of RoI insolvency laws relating to certain limitations on the
Guarantees and security interests in respect of the New Notes, insofar as they are provided by the RoI Guarantor.

The application of these laws could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Guarantees or
the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the New Notes and limit any amounts that you may receive. The
STADA Group has also analyzed the typical forms of security interests in RoI which are commonly created in
RoI over a company’s assets, namely fixed and floating charges.

**_Fixed and Floating Charges_**

Under RoI law, there are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge
security: (a) an examiner appointed to the charging company can deal with floating charge assets; (b) a fixed
charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the floating charge over the
charged assets; (c) general costs and expenses (including the liquidator’s remuneration) properly incurred in a
winding up are payable out of the company’s assets (including the assets that are the subject of the floating charge)
in priority to floating charge claims; (d) until the floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to

363


-----

deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such
assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a Third-party good title to the assets
free of the floating charge and so as to give rise to the risk of security being granted over such assets in priority to
the floating charge security; (e) floating charge security is subject to certain challenges under Irish insolvency law
(please see “—Challenges to Guarantees and Security—Grant of Floating Charge”); and (f) floating charge
security is subject to the claims of preferential creditors in a winding up (such as certain taxes, salaries owed to
employees subject to a time limit and holiday pay owed to employees).

Under RoI law there is a possibility that a court could recharacterize fixed security interests purported to be created
by a security document as floating charges; the description given to security interests by the parties is not
determinative. Whether security interests labelled as fixed will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than
floating security interests will depend on, among other things, whether the chargee has the requisite degree of
control over the relevant chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether
such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets
without the consent of the chargee prior to crystallization, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in
question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge in the security
documents. In addition, to the extent that any of the assets which are expressed to be subject to a fixed charge are
not specifically identified, the court may hold that such assets are, in fact, subject to a floating charge.

**_Preferred Creditors Under RoI Law_**

Under Section 621 (Preferential Payments in a winding up) (“Section 621”) of the Companies Act 2014 (as
amended, the “Companies Act”) in a winding up of an RoI company certain preferential debts are required to be
paid in priority to all debts other than those secured by a fixed charge. Preferential debts therefore have priority
over debts secured by a floating charge. If the assets of the relevant company available for the payment of general
creditors are insufficient to pay the preferential debts, they are required to be paid out of the property subject to
the floating charge. Section 621 was amended by the Companies (Accounting) Act 2017 (with effect from June
9, 2017) with the effect that a charge created as a floating charge by a company will continue to rank as a floating
charge on a winding up of that company, even if that floating charge has crystallized. Under Section 440
(Preferential Payments when receiver appointed under floating charge) of the Companies Act, the holder of a
floating charge, or a receiver appointed by such a holder, who takes possession of property subject to the floating
charge when the company is not in the course of being wound up, is required to pay the preferential debts out of
that property in priority to principal and interest secured by the floating charge. Such preferential debts would
comprise, among other things, any amounts owed in respect of local rates and certain amounts owed to the RoI
Revenue Commissioners for income/corporation/capital gains tax, value added tax (VAT), employee related
taxes, social security and pension scheme contributions and remuneration, salaries and wages of employees and
certain contractors and the expenses of liquidation.

In addition, there is a further limited category of super preferential creditors which take priority, not only over
unsecured creditors and holders of floating security, but also over holders of fixed security. These super
preferential claims include the remuneration, costs and expenses properly incurred by any examiner (or process
advisor) of the company which may include any borrowings made by an examiner to fund the company’s
requirements for the duration of his appointment that have been approved by the RoI courts, (see “—
_Examinership” and "SCARP process" below) and any capital gains tax payable on the disposition of an asset of_
the company by a liquidator, receiver or mortgagee in possession as well as, in certain circumstances, PAYE and
VAT arrears where a fixed charge over book debts is created.

Furthermore, and as referred to above (see “—Fixed and Floating Charges”), in the case of the application of
moneys arising from the realization of secured assets that are subject to a floating charge, or in a winding up, the
costs of the liquidation and the liquidator’s fees and certain liabilities incurred by a company subject to a SCARP
process will take priority over the claims of floating chargeholders in respect of relevant assets.

**_Examinership_**

Examinership is a court procedure available under the Companies Act to facilitate the survival of the whole or
part of an RoI company the whole or any part of its undertaking through the appointment of an examiner and the
formulation by the examiner of proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement. In circumstances where
an RoI company is or is likely to be unable to pay its debts, then that company, the directors of that company, a
contingent, prospective or actual creditor of that company, or shareholders of that company holding, at the date
of presentation of the petition, not less than one tenth of the paid up voting share capital of that company are each
entitled to petition the court for the appointment of an examiner to that company. Provided the company can

364


-----

demonstrate its survival (and all or part of its undertaking) as a going concern, and can satisfy certain tests, the
ROI company may be placed under the protection of the relevant Irish court (the “Court”) for a period of time
whilst its affairs are investigated by an independent examiner whose function is to see whether the company is
capable of being rescued and to supervise the restructuring process.

Where the Court appoints an examiner to a company, it may, at the same or any time thereafter, make an order
appointing the examiner to be examiner for the purposes of the Companies Act to a related company of such
company. Once confirmed by the Court the scheme is binding on the company and all its members and creditors.
During the protection period the day to day business of the company remains under the control of the directors of
the company, subject to certain rights of the examiner to apply to the Court.

Once appointed an examiner must, as soon as practical, formulate proposals for a compromise or scheme of
arrangement in relation to the company to which he has been appointed. Typically, a scheme of arrangement will
involve the writing down of creditors’ claims (both secured and unsecured, contingent and actual) that are in
existence at the date of the petition and the introduction into the company of new funds. The examiner has the
power to set aside contracts and arrangements entered into by the company after this appointment and, in certain
circumstances, can avoid a negative pledge given by the company prior to this appointment. Furthermore, the
examiner may sell assets of the company which are the subject of security. Where such assets are the subject of a
fixed security interest, the examiner must account to the holders of the fixed security interest for the amount
realized and discharge the amount due to the holders of the fixed security interest out of the proceeds of the sale.
Having formulated his proposals, he must convene meetings of such classes of members and creditors as he thinks
proper to consider acceptance of his proposals. The examiner must report to the Court on the outcome of his
meetings within 35 days of his appointment, although the 35 day period can be extended by the Court. There is
acceptance by creditors or by a class of creditors when a majority in number representing a majority in value of
the claims represented at the meeting vote in favor of the proposals. The proposals must be confirmed by the Court
if they are to become effective and the Court can confirm the proposals only if, inter alia:

(a) either

(i) a majority in number of creditors whose interests or claims would be impaired by implementation
of the proposals, representing a majority in value of the claims that would be impaired by
implementation of the proposals, have voted to accept the proposals; or

(ii) if the above requirement is not satisfied, then a majority of the classes of creditors whose interests
would be impaired by the scheme of arrangement have voted to accept them, provided that at least
one of those creditor classes is a class of secured creditors or is senior to the class of ordinary
unsecured creditors; or

(iii) if the above requirement is not satisfied, at least one class of creditors whose interests or claims
would be impaired by the proposals, other than a class which would not receive any payment or
keep any interest in a liquidation, has voted to accept them; and

(b) no dissenting creditor would be worse off if the proposals are confirmed and implemented than such a
creditor would be if the normal ranking of liquidation priorities were applied, either in the event of
liquidation, whether piecemeal or by sale as a going concern, or in the event of the next-best-alternative
scenario if the proposals were not confirmed.

Once confirmed by the Court, the proposals become binding on the company and all creditors (whether secured
or unsecured) or the class or classes of creditors (whether secured or unsecured), as the case may be, affected by
the proposals and their rights are accordingly modified.

For as long as a company is under the protection of the Court, no attachment, sequestration, distress or execution
shall be put into force against the property or effects of the relevant company except with the consent of the
examiner. Section 520 (Effect of petition to appoint examiner on creditors and others) of the Companies Act
provides, among other things, that except with the consent of the examiner:

- where any claim against the company is secured by a mortgage, charge, lien or other encumbrance or a pledge
of, on or affecting the whole or any part of the property, effects or income of the ROI company, no-action
may be taken to realize the whole or any part of such security;

365


-----

- no receiver over any part of the property or undertaking of the ROI company shall be appointed (and if a
receiver was appointed before the petition was presented, that receiver was unable to act); and

- no proceedings for the winding up of the company may be commenced and no resolution for winding up of
the company may be passed (and no such resolution passed shall have any effect).

In addition, pursuant to Section 521 (Restriction on payment of pre-petition debts) of the Companies Act, no
payment may be made by a company during the period of Court protection by way of satisfaction or discharge of
the whole or a part of a liability incurred by the company before the date upon which the petition for the examiner’s
appointment was presented unless the independent expert’s report under Section 511 (Independent expert’s report)
of the Companies Act that accompanied the petition recommended that all or part of that liability be discharged
or satisfied, or such payment is authorized by the relevant Irish court (on application of the examiner or any
interested party) where the relevant Irish court is satisfied that a failure to discharge or satisfy in whole or in part
that liability would considerably reduce the prospects of the company or the whole or any part of its undertaking
surviving as a going concern.

Where an examinership petition is presented in relation to a company, that company is deemed to be under the
protection of the Court during the period beginning on presentation of the petition and ending 70 days later (which
period may be extended by a further 30 days (and during the interim period by a further period of up to 50 days
in exceptional circumstances (including but not limited to the impact of COVID-19 on the company) where the
Court is satisfied that the examiner would not be able to present his report within 70 days, or by such further
unlimited period as the Court may allow where the Court needs more time to consider the proposals contained in
the examiner’s final report). The ability to extend the period of protection to 150 days is an interim measure
introduced as a result of COVID-19, which will remain in force until December 31, 2022, although it may be
further extended. In the event of an appeal of the Court’s decision, the protection period is likely to be further
extended in order to allow the determination of the appeal.

Furthermore, the Court may order that an examiner shall have any of the powers of a liquidator appointed by the
Court would have, which could include the power to apply to have transactions disclaimed if the related contract
amounted to an unfair preference.

**_Primary Risks for Holders of Notes in an Examinership_**

The primary risks to the holders of the New Notes, under the laws of Ireland, if an examiner were appointed to
the RoI Guarantor and/or to a company related to such an RoI company and where any amounts due under the
New Notes were unpaid, are as follows: (a) there may be a delay in enforcing the payment obligations of the RoI
Guarantor in respect of the New Notes and of any payment obligations contained in a guarantee given by any
other related company subject to the examinership proceedings; (b) the potential for a compromise or scheme of
arrangement being approved involving the writing down or rescheduling of the debt due by the RoI Guarantor to
the holders of the New Notes; (c) the potential for a compromise or scheme of arrangement being approved
involving the writing down or rescheduling of any payment obligations owed to the holders of the New Notes by
a company related to such RoI Guarantor; (d) the potential for the examiner to seek to set aside any negative
pledge prohibiting the creation of security or the incurring of borrowings by the RoI Guarantor to enable the
examiner to borrow to fund the guarantor or issuer during the protection period; and (e) in the event that a scheme
of arrangement is not approved in respect of an RoI company guarantor of the New Notes and the guarantor
subsequently goes into liquidation, the examiner’s remuneration and expenses (including certain borrowings
incurred by the examiner on behalf of the guarantor and approved by the RoI High Court) will take priority over
the moneys and liabilities which from time to time are or may become due, owing or payable by it to the holders
of the New Notes.

**_SCARP process_**

The Companies (Rescue Process for Small and Micro Companies) Act 2021 (the "SCARP Act")) was signed into
law on 22 July 2021, and commenced on 7 December 2021. The SCARP Act provides for a new administrative
rescue process – referred to as the Small Company Administrative Rescue Process ("SCARP") – which will be
available exclusively to small and micro companies.

A small company (excluding a holding company and ineligible companies) is defined as one fulfilling two or
more of the following requirements in relation to a financial year:

(a) the amount of turnover does not exceed €12 million;

366


-----

(b) the balance sheet total of the company does not exceed €6 million; and

(c) the average number of employees does not exceed 50.

The comparable conditions to qualify as a micro company are:

(a) the amount of turnover does not exceed €700,000;

(b) the balance sheet total of the company does not exceed €350,000; and

(c) the average number of employees does not exceed 10.

As the RoI Guarantor is an Irish company, it could be the subject of a SCARP if it satisfied the conditions to
qualify as a either a small company or a micro company (as outlined above); however, it does not currently satisfy
such conditions.

The SCARP process is similar to examinership (as discussed above) but differs from examinership in some
material ways, including:

(a) The Irish Revenue Commissioners (and other state creditors) may object to the inclusion of certain
“excludable liabilities" (pertaining to unpaid taxes and liabilities with respect to the Irish Revenue
Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection and other liabilities arising from the Redundancy
Payments and Protection of Employees Acts).

(b) The RoI Guarantor would have no automatic protections and would have to apply to the court for protective
orders.

(c) The SCARP process cannot be initiated by a creditor.

(d) The SCARP process will not currently be recognized under the Recast Insolvency Regulation (2015/848).

**_Primary Risks for Holders of Notes in a SCARP process_**

The primary risks to the holders of the New Notes, under the laws of Ireland, if the RoI Guarantor were subject
to the SCARP process and where any amounts due under the New Notes were unpaid, are as follows: (a) there
may be a delay in enforcing the payment obligations of the RoI Guarantor in respect of the New Notes; (b) the
potential for a "rescue plan" devised by the "process adviser" (an insolvency practitioner who must be qualified
to act as a liquidator under the Companies Act) being approved which involves the writing down or rescheduling
of the debt due by the RoI Guarantor to the holders of the New Notes; (c) the potential for "rescue plan" being
approved which provides for the repudiation of contracts on behalf of the RoI Guarantor where the process adviser
considers it necessary for the survival of the RoI Guarantor as a going concern (whilst court approval is not
required, the right is subject to certain notice obligations and the right of claimants to object to the proposed
repudiation); and (d) in the event that a rescue plan is not approved in respect of the RoI Guarantor and the RoI
Guarantor subsequently goes into liquidation, the process advisor's remuneration and expenses will take priority
over the moneys and liabilities which from time to time are or may become due, owing or payable by it to the
holders of the New Notes.

**_Challenges to Guarantees and Security_**

There are circumstances under RoI insolvency law in which the granting by an RoI company of security and
guarantees can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if an examiner or a liquidator is appointed to the
RoI company within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) of the granting of the security or giving
of the guarantee and, in addition, the company was “unable to pay its debts” when the security interest was granted
or when the guarantee was given or “unable to pay its debts” within the meaning of the Companies Act as a result.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to security interests and guarantees:

_Unfair Preference_

Under Irish insolvency law, if an ROI company goes into liquidation, a liquidator may apply to the court to have
certain transactions disclaimed if the related contract amounted to an unfair preference. Section 604 (Unfair
preference: effect of winding up on antecedent and other transactions) of the Companies Act (“Section 604”)
provides that any conveyance, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment, execution or other act relating to property

367


-----

made or done by or against a company which is unable to pay its debts as they become due in favor of any creditor
of the company or any person on trust for any such creditor, with a view to giving such creditor (or any surety or
guarantor of the debt due to such creditor) a preference over the company’s other creditors, shall be deemed to be
an unfair preference of its creditors and be invalid accordingly if a winding up of the company commences within
six months of the doing of the act and the company is, at the date of commencement of the winding up, unable to
pay its debts (taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities).

_Improperly Transferred Assets_

Under Section 608 (Power of the court to order return of assets which have been improperly transferred) of the
Companies Act (“Section 608”), if it can be shown on the application of a liquidator, creditor or contributory of a
company which is being wound up, to the satisfaction of the High Court, that any property of that company was
disposed of (including a disposal by way of charge, security assignment or mortgage) and the effect of such a
disposal was to “perpetrate a fraud” on the company, its creditors or members, the High Court may, if it deems it
just and equitable to do so, order any person who appears to have “use, control or possession” of the property
concerned, or of the proceeds of the sale or development of that property, to deliver it or them, or to pay a sum in
respect of it to the liquidator on such terms as the High Court sees fit. The ability to use Section 608 to challenge
the transfer of assets has been extended to receivers and examiners. Section 608 does not apply to a disposal that
would constitute an unfair preference for the purposes of Section 604.

_Disclaimer of Onerous Contracts_

Under Section 615 (Disclaimer of onerous property in case of company being wound up) of the Companies Act,
the liquidator of a company may, by the giving of notice, disclaim any onerous property of the company. “Onerous
property” is defined to include any “unprofitable contract” and “any other property (of the company) which is
unsaleable or not readily saleable by reason of its binding the possessor of it to the performance of any onerous
act or to the payment of any sum of money.”

_Grant of Floating Charge_

Under Section 597 (Circumstances in which floating charge is invalid) of the Companies Act, a floating charge is
invalid if created in the period of twelve-months (or two years if created in favor of a “connected person”) ending
with the date of commencement of the winding up of the company, and unless it can be proven that the company
was solvent immediately after the creation of the charge. Such invalidity does not apply to money actually
advanced or paid or the actual price or value of goods or services sold or supplied to the company at the time or
after the creation of, and in consideration for, the charge together with interest at the appropriate rate.

_General_

If the RoI Guarantor becomes subject to an RoI law insolvency proceeding and that company has obligations to
creditors that are treated under RoI law as senior relative to the company’s obligations to the noteholders, the
noteholders may suffer losses as a result of their subordinated status during such insolvency proceeding.

The validity and enforceability of a guarantee or security interest may be contested on the basis that it is prohibited
under the relevant company’s constitution. To the extent that the constitution does not allow such an action, there
is the risk that the grant of the guarantees may be found to be void and unenforceable. Further, guarantees by the
Irish guarantors for the obligations of another group company must be in the commercial interest and for the
corporate benefit of the Irish guarantors. If the giving of a guarantee is not for the Irish guarantors’ corporate
benefit, the guarantees could be held null and void. The question of corporate benefit is determined on a case by
case basis and consideration has to be given to any direct and/or indirect benefit that the company would actually
derive from the transaction and is particularly relevant for upstream or cross stream guarantees. The question
whether or not the corporate benefit requirement is met is a matter of fact, which must be assessed by the
competent body of the company being the board of directors of the company acting bona fide in the interest of the
company. If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the directors of the company may be held liable by the
company for negligence in the management of the company. Moreover, the guarantees could be declared null and
void. The validity and/or enforceability of the guarantees may also be subject to the statutes of limitations,
defenses such as set-off or counterclaim, the doctrine of frustration and the doctrine of estoppel, and the fact that
equitable remedies will only be granted by the Irish court in its discretion.

Subject to certain exceptions, under Section 82 (Financial assistance for acquisition of shares) of the Companies
Act (“Section 82”), it is unlawful for a RoI company to give, whether directly or indirectly, and whether by means
of a loan, guarantee, the provision of security or otherwise, any financial assistance for the purpose of or in

368


-----

connection with a purchase or subscription made or to be made by any person or for any shares in the company
or its holding company. As a result, the New Notes may only be guaranteed by the relevant ROI company to the
extent that it would not result in such guarantee constituting the giving of unlawful financial assistance under
Section 82.

Pursuant to Section 1001 of the RoI Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the holder of a fixed security over book debts
of an RoI tax resident company may be required by notice from the RoI Revenue Commissioners to pay to them
sums equivalent to those which the holder thereafter receives in payment of debts due to it by the relevant
company. Where the holder of the security has informed the RoI Revenue Commissioners of the creation of the
security within 21 days of its creation, the holder’s liability is limited to the amount of certain outstanding RoI tax
liabilities of the company (including liabilities in respect of value added tax) arising after the issue to the holder
of a notice from the RoI Revenue Commissioners.

The RoI Revenue Commissioners may also attach any debt due to an RoI tax resident company by another person
in order to discharge any liabilities of the company in respect of outstanding tax whether the liabilities are due on
its own account or as an agent or trustee. It is possible that the scope of this right of the RoI Revenue
Commissioners may override the rights of holders of security (whether fixed or floating) over the debt in question.

**Northern Ireland**

**_Insolvency_**

One of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors is incorporated under the laws of Northern Ireland (the “NI Obligor”).
Accordingly, insolvency proceedings in respect of the NI Obligor are likely to be governed by the laws of Northern
Ireland.

It is nonetheless possible that insolvency proceedings with respect to the NI Obligor could be opened in a different
jurisdiction and be governed by the insolvency laws of that jurisdiction. In particular, while the UK was a member
state of the EU insolvency processes opened in the UK were subject to both EU and applicable domestic
legislation. Following the UK's departure from the EU and the expiry of the subsequent transition period (the
“Transition Period”) on December 31, 2020, in accordance with the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as
amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020) EU law as directly applicable in the UK at
the end of the Transition Period (subject to certain exceptions) was transposed into NI domestic law subject to
significant amendments. Accordingly, the United Kingdom is no longer a European member state, including for
the purposes of the EU Insolvency Regulation and Regulation (EU) 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and
of the Council on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters
(the “EU _Judgments Regulation”), which have largely been repealed in the United Kingdom (pursuant to The_
Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, (SI 2019/146 (as amended) the “Insolvency Brexit
_Regulations”) and The Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019). The_
Insolvency Brexit Regulations also effected key amendments to domestic insolvency laws, including the
Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (the “Insolvency Order”) and the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations
2006 (SI 2006/1030) (the “Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations”). Accordingly, the United Kingdom is no longer
party to the European regime for reciprocal recognition of insolvency proceedings or civil/commercial judgments
under the EU Insolvency Regulation or the EU Judgments Regulation, respectively. The prospects of a European
member state opening insolvency proceedings in respect of the NI Obligor may vary between member states; the
implications of any such proceedings, including the prospect and implications of recognition in the United
Kingdom, would need to be carefully considered in each case.

For instance, unless insolvency proceedings or certain related proceedings were opened prior to the expiry of the
Transition Period, in which case the unmodified EU Insolvency Regulation and related EU insolvency legislation
govern the proceedings, insolvency proceedings with respect to the NI Obligor would likely proceed under, and
be governed by, Northern Irish insolvency laws in force at the time of commencement of the relevant proceedings.
However, to the extent that a Northern Irish Obligor has its COMI in a member state of the EU insolvency
proceedings could, pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation and subject to certain exceptions, be opened in the
relevant EU member state and be subject to the laws of that EU member state (see, “European Union”) above. In
addition, pursuant to the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations, certain foreign courts may have jurisdiction to
oversee insolvency proceedings of a Northern Irish Obligor which has its COMI or an “establishment” (being a
place of operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or
services) in such foreign jurisdiction.

369


-----

Although the scope of the Northern Irish courts' jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings
available in Northern Ireland, Northern Irish courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in
respect of any company which has its COMI in the UK, or which has its COMI in an EU member state (other than
Denmark) and an “establishment” in the UK. An “establishment” is defined in the same way as under the EU
Insolvency Regulation (see “European Union” above). While this allows Northern Irish courts to assume
jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings, the efficacy of such
proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings
in relevant other jurisdictions (see “Cross-border recognition of Northern Irish insolvency and restructuring
proceedings” below).

Insolvency laws in Northern Ireland may not be as favorable to their interests as the laws of the United States and
other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. Where the NI Obligor experiences financial difficulties, it is not
possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings.

Northern Irish insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a guarantee provided by the
NI Obligor and any security interests granted by the NI Obligor.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Northern Irish insolvency laws relating to certain
limitations on the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and security interests in respect of the New Notes, insofar as
they are provided by the NI Obligor.

The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees or the Senior Secured Notes Collateral securing the New Notes and limit any amounts
that they may receive. The Group has also analyzed the typical forms of security interests in Northern Ireland
which are commonly created in Northern Ireland over a company’s assets, namely fixed and floating charges.

**_General_**

The laws relating to insolvency and the validity/enforceability of guarantees and security are broadly the same as
those in England and Wales but substantially different from those equivalent laws in the Republic of Ireland.

As a general rule, insolvency proceedings with respect to a Northern Irish company should be commenced in
Northern Ireland based on Northern Irish insolvency laws; although insolvency proceedings in respect of Northern
Irish companies could also be based in other jurisdictions under certain circumstances. Formal insolvency
proceedings under the laws of Northern Ireland may be initiated in a number of ways, including by (i) the
company, its directors, or one or more of its creditors making an application to the High Court for administration,
(ii) the company, its directors, or a qualifying floating chargeholder appointing administrators out of court, or (iii)
a creditor or the directors or members of the company filing a petition to wind up a Northern Irish company or the
company resolving to wind itself up (in the case of liquidation).

A Northern Irish company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be placed into administration
if it is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, and the administration is reasonably likely to achieve one
of the three statutory purposes.

**_Administration_**

Under the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 as amended by the Insolvency Brexit Regulations,
administration proceedings are available in respect of any company incorporated in an EEA Member State, in
addition to a company registered under the Companies Act 2006 in England and Wales, Northern Ireland or
Scotland and any company (irrespective of its country of incorporation) with its COMI in an EU Member State
(other than Denmark) or upon request from courts in other parts of the United Kingdom or certain other countries
and territories. In each case and subject to specific conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is
satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) that the
administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration.

A company is deemed to be unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (it is proved to the
satisfaction of the court that it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due), if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet”
basis (it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of
its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), if it fails to satisfy a creditor’s statutory
demand for a debt exceeding £750 within the specified time or if it fails to satisfy in full a judgment debt (or
similar court order) as per Article 103 of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989. Such insolvency is
presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt

370


-----

exceeding £750 within 21 days of service or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order).
Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, a Northern Irish company, the directors of such company or
the holder of a qualifying floating charge where the floating charge has become enforceable, may also appoint an
administrator through an out of court process, subject to certain exceptions pursuant to the Insolvency (Northern
Ireland) Order 1989.

The purpose of an administration comprises three objectives, each of which must be considered successively to
determine whether it is reasonable to put the company into administration: rescuing the company as a goingconcern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole
than would be likely if the company were wound up (without first being in administration) or, if neither of those
objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed
thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The order of
priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (see “Priority of Claims on Insolvency”
below). An administrator must attempt to achieve the objectives of administration in order, unless (s)he thinks it
is not reasonably practicable to achieve the primary objective, or that the secondary objective would achieve a
better result for the company’s creditors as a whole. The administrator cannot pursue the third objective unless
(s)he thinks either the first or the second objective is unachievable and that it will not unnecessarily harm the
interests of the creditors of the company as a whole to pursue the third objective. Certain rights of creditors,
including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment of an administrator, a
statutory moratorium is imposed and no step may be taken to enforce security or a guarantee over the company’s
property except with the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court (although a demand for
payment could be made under a guarantee granted by the company). The same requirements for consent or
permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution,
distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider
discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of
administration described above. Accordingly, if a Northern Irish Obligor were to enter into administration, the
notes and the guarantee, as applicable, may not be enforceable while the relevant company was in administration
without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent
would obtain such permission of the court or consent of the administrator.

In addition, an administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements
under the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, dispose of the property of a company in administration
(including property subject to a floating charge). A set proportion of the proceeds of the realization of any property
subject to a floating charge will need to be set aside for satisfaction of the claims of preferential creditors and the
ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part (see “Prescribed Part” below). An administrator may also, with prior approval
by the court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote
the purpose of the administration and the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal towards
discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder.

**_Qualifying Floating Charge_**

If a company grants security constituting a “qualifying floating charge” to a party for the purposes of Northern
Irish insolvency law, that party will be able to appoint an administrator out of court (see “Administration” above)
or (in limited circumstances) an administrative receiver (see “Administrative Receivership” below). The holder of
a qualifying floating charge is also entitled to advance notice of an intention of a company or its directors to
appoint an administrator, allowing the charge holder to either appoint its own administrator (or, where applicable,
administrative receiver) in place of the proposed administrator, conduct negotiations with the proposed appointors
over the identity or terms of appointment of the proposed administrator or (in an extreme case) prevent the
company going into administration.

In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a)
states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it, (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an
administrator of the company or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within
the meaning given by Article 5(1) of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended). The Security
Agent will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary)
with the fixed charge security interests, relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the relevant Northern
Irish obligor’s property and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge.

371


-----

**_Administrative Receivership_**

Administrative receivership as a creditor remedy has been largely abolished and is only available in very limited
circumstances. If a company grants a “qualifying floating charge” to a party for the purposes of Northern Irish
insolvency law, that party will be able to appoint an administrator using the out of court process. In the case of
the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document
pre dates March 27, 2006, fall within one of the exceptions in the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as
amended) to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers.

The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception
relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, as
amended), which will apply if a Northern Irish obligor creates a debt of at least £50,000,000 for the relevant
company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets
investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, as amended, but is generally a
rated, listed or traded debt instrument).

**_Fixed charge receivership_**

A fixed charge receiver (as opposed to an administrative receiver, who is appointed under certain floating charges

- see “Administrative receivership” above) may be appointed over some or all of the assets secured by a fixed
charge in accordance with the terms of a security document creating a fixed charge or (in limited circumstances)
pursuant to statute.

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge (such
as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an appointment
to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator.

The primary duty of the fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning (s)he
owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor (although the receiver owes the chargor a duty to act in good
faith during the course of his or her appointment). This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs
his or her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary
remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to
take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver
will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the
company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor).

To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be deducted from
the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors (see
“Prescribed Part” below).

**_Liquidation/Winding-up_**

The NI Obligor may be wound up under the laws of Northern Ireland. This means that the NI Obligor would be
placed into either creditors’ voluntary liquidation or compulsory liquidation, both of which are insolvent
liquidations. The NI Obligor is not referring to the process of Members’ voluntary liquidation which is a solvent
winding up and outside the scope of this analysis.

On the liquidation of a Northern Irish company, there is no automatic statutory moratorium in place preventing,
amongst other things, the holders of security interests from taking steps to enforce those security interests. Where
the NI Obligor is placed into creditors’ voluntary liquidation, there are no restrictions on the holder of security
either by way of fixed or floating charge from taking steps to enforce those security interests unless the liquidator
or any creditor has applied to a court for a stay. However, where the NI Obligor is placed into compulsory
liquidation, the consent of a Northern Irish Court is strictly required before any security interest can be enforced
and a court order would be required to place the company into administration. In addition, with compulsory
liquidation where the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees are unsecured because of some
inherent defect in the security interest, that Obligor cannot take action or commence proceedings to recover the
amounts due on foot of the guarantee without the consent of a Northern Irish Court by virtue of Article 110(3) of
the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended).

372

**_Scheme of Arrangement_**

Although not an insolvency proceeding, a scheme of arrangement is a statutory procedure pursuant to Part 26 of
the Companies Act 2006, which permits a company to enter into an arrangement or compromise with its members
or creditors (or any class of them). The Northern Irish courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement
that effects a compromise of a company’s liabilities with respect to its creditors (or any class of its creditors)
where (a) such company is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 and, in the
context of a non-Northern Irish company, (b) has a “sufficient connection” to the Northern Irish jurisdiction.

In practice, a non-Northern Irish company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb is likely
to be satisfied where, among other things, the company’s COMI is in Northern Ireland, the company’s finance
documents are Northern Irish law-governed, or the company’s finance documents have been amended in
accordance with their terms to be governed by Northern Irish law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its
particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not specific
circumstances satisfy the requirement for sufficient connection in any given case.

Before the court considers whether or not to sanction a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the
proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes,
depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that
such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If
a majority in number representing 75 per cent. or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the
meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval
thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be
binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those
who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing at which
the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has discretion as
to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made to the
scheme or decline to sanction the scheme. In exercising its discretion to sanction a scheme of a non-Northern Irish
Obligor, the court will need to be satisfied that the scheme of arrangement would have substantial effect in the
jurisdictions in which the company has its main assets or operations, in the jurisdictions of any other obligors of
the debt and under the governing law of the affected debt documents (if not Northern Irish law). This is typically
achieved by providing expert evidence that the scheme of arrangement (or its effect) is likely to be recognized in
such jurisdictions. Once sanctioned, the scheme of arrangement binds all affected stakeholders whose rights will
be as set out in the scheme of arrangement, which shall be effective (in accordance with its terms) upon delivery
of the court’s order sanctioning the scheme of arrangement to the Registrar of Companies.

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not automatically
trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings.

Schemes of arrangement have always been outside the scope of the EU Insolvency Regulation on the basis that
they are not considered to be ‘insolvency’ proceedings (although they are, in practice, often used by financially
distressed companies). Instead, if a scheme previously required recognition within the EU, the EU Judgments
Regulation was commonly relied upon as a basis on which recognition of the judgment of the court sanctioning
the scheme could be obtained in each member state.

**_Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020_**

The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (“CIGA”) was enacted on June 25, 2020 and amends several
provisions of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989. CIGA is intended to improve the ability of companies
to be efficiently restructured; it includes the following provisions.

**_Restructuring Plan Procedure_**

CIGA introduced a new restructuring procedure, similar to a scheme of arrangement but with the added possibility
of cross-class cram-down to bind classes of dissenting stakeholders to the restructuring plan.

Like a scheme of arrangement, a restructuring plan is a procedure under the Companies Act 2006, namely Part
26A of the Companies Act 2006 and is available to any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency
(Northern Ireland) Order 1989.

A restructuring plan procedure may be proposed by the company or other stakeholders (including creditors,
shareholders, administrators or liquidators). As with a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the

373


-----

proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes 278
depending on the rights of such creditors which will be affected by the proposed restructuring plan and any new
rights that such creditors are given under the restructuring plan.

The restructuring plan procedure is available as an option to both solvent and insolvent companies; the company
need only show that (a) it has encountered, or be likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or
will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern, and (b) a compromise or arrangement has
been proposed between the company and its creditors (or any class of them) whose purpose it is to eliminate,
reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect of, any of those financial difficulties.

A restructuring plan will be deemed to be approved if at least 75% in value of the creditors present and voting at
the meeting of at least one class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed compromise. There is no requirement
for the approving creditors to constitute a majority in number of those creditors present and voting, and there is
crucially no requirement for each and every voting class to approve the plan, provided that:

- the court is satisfied that none of the members of the dissenting class(es) would be any worse off under the
plan than they would be in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’ (being whatever the court considers would
be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned); and

- at least one class of creditors who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the
company, in the event of the relevant alternative has voted in favor of the plan.

By virtue of these mechanics, the restructuring plan process provides for the possibility of a ‘cross-class cramdown’ meaning the court may sanction a restructuring plan even if one or more classes of affected creditors do
not vote in favor of the restructuring plan, effectively allowing the vote of one class of stakeholders to bind other
classes. Following approval of the restructuring plan at the creditor meeting (s), the restructuring plan needs to be
sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review whether the applicable statutory
conditions have been met and may also consider whether the restructuring plan is just and equitable. The court
has discretion as to whether to sanction the restructuring plan as approved, make an order conditional upon
modifications being made or refuse to sanction the restructuring plan. Once sanctioned, the restructuring plan
binds all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the restructuring plan, which shall be effective
(in accordance with its terms) upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the restructuring plan to the Registrar
of Companies.

As with schemes of arrangement, but unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a restructuring
plan does not automatically trigger a moratorium on claims on proceedings.

Stakeholders’ rights following confirmation of a restructuring plan will be as provided for in the plan. If a company
were subsequently to enter an insolvency procedure following a restructuring plan, the rights and claims of any
stakeholders bound by the plan would be as set out in the plan. Any debt forgiveness would therefore be binding
in the subsequent insolvency proceedings.

**_Priority of Claims on Insolvency_**

One of the primary functions of liquidation (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going-concern, one
of the possible functions of administration) under Northern Irish law is to realize the assets of the insolvent
company and to distribute the cash realizations made from those assets to its creditors. Under the Insolvency
(Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (as amended) and the Insolvency Rules (Northern Ireland) 1991 (as amended),
creditors are placed into different classes and, with the exceptions and adjustments noted below, the proceeds
from the realization of the insolvent company’s property is applied in descending order of priority, as set out
below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined above), distributions generally cannot be made to a
class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors
have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion
to the debts due to each creditor within a class.

Contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or administration are only
respected to the extent they fall within the definition of “mutual dealing” as applied by the mandatory insolvency
set-off regime. This regime sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of
their mutual dealings, and only the resulting net balance is either provable by the creditor in the administration or
liquidation of the company (if amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the
company (if amounts remain due to the company).

374


-----

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

- _First ranking: holders of fixed charge security but only to the extent the realizations from those secured_
assets cover the indebtedness;

- _Second ranking: prescribed fees and expenses of the official receiver;_

- _Third ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate incurred during the relevant insolvency proceedings (there_
are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are-paid);

- _Fourth ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors._

Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to:
(a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done
in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; and (c) holiday pay due to
any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of
insolvency.

Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of ordinary preferential debts and include claims
by HM Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including
student loan repayments), employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but
excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees
and customers. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally after the ordinary preferential
debts;

- _Fifth ranking: holders of floating charge security, to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets,_
according to the priority of their security. This would include any floating charge that was stated to be a
fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on a proper interpretation by the court, was rendered
a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the
Prescribed Part (as defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to
unsecured creditors;

- _Six ranking: provable debts of unsecured creditors and any secured creditor to the extent of any remaining_
debt due to it (a shortfall), in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date
of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any shortfall, the
insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not
entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all
unsecured creditors or the secured creditor elects to surrender its security;

- _Seventh ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining_
funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination
language in the relevant documentation.

**_Prescribed Part_**

An administrator, receiver or liquidator of the company will be required to ring fence a certain percentage of the
proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security (after making full provision for preferential creditors and
expenses (floating charge realizations)) for the benefit of unsecured creditors. Under current law, this applies to
50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum
aggregate cap of £600,000. Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and other security will
constitute substantially the whole of the relevant Northern Irish obligor’s assets at the time that the floating charges
are enforced will be a question of fact at that time.

**_Challenges to Guarantees and Security_**

There are circumstances under Northern Irish insolvency law in which the granting by a Northern Irish company
of security and guarantees, or the entry by a Northern Irish company into a transaction can be challenged. In most
cases, this will only arise if the Northern Irish company is placed into administration or liquidation within a
specified period of the granting of the guarantee or security. Therefore, if during the specified period an
administrator or liquidator is appointed to a Northern Irish company, the administrator or liquidator may challenge

375


-----

the validity of the security or guarantee given by such company, or certain transactions entered into by the
company. The Issuer cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of the NI Obligor's insolvency (as described
below) is within any of the requisite time periods, the grant of a security interest and/or guarantee in respect of
the relevant notes would not be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid.

**_Onset of Insolvency_**

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid
floating charges (as discussed below), depends on the insolvency procedure in question.

In an administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an administration
order is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c) otherwise, the date
on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect.

In a compulsory liquidation the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court,
whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes a winding-up resolution. Where liquidation
follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be the same as for the initial administration.

**_Connected Persons_**

If the given transaction at an undervalue, preference, or invalid floating charge has been entered into by the
company with a “connected person,” then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any
challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set out below). A “connected person” of a company granting a
security interest or guarantee for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences or invalid floating
charges is a party who is: (a) a director of the company; (b) a shadow director; (c) an associate of such director or
shadow director; or (d) an associate of the relevant company.

A party is associated with an individual if they are: (a) a relative of the individual; (b) the individual’s husband,
wife or civil partner; (c) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (d) the husband, wife or civil
partner of a relative of the individual; or (e) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual’s
husband, wife or civil partner.

A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company. A company is associated with another
company if (a) the same person has control of both companies, (b) a person has control of one and persons who
are his or her associates, or (s)he and persons who are his or her associates, have control of the other or (c) if a
group of two or more persons has control of each company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or
could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group
as replaced by a person of whom (s)he is an associate.

A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company
which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his or her directions or
instructions, or (s)he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any
general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons
together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company. The following
potential grounds for challenge may apply under Northern Irish law to guarantees and security interests:

_Transaction at an Undervalue_

Under Northern Irish insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a Northern Irish company could apply to a
Northern Irish Court for an Order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator
or administrator believes that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a gift or transfer for
no or significantly less consideration. There will only be a transaction at an undervalue if, at the time of the
transaction or as a result of the transaction, the Northern Irish company was or becomes unable to pay its debts
(as defined in Article 103 of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989). The transaction is subject to potential
challenge if the Northern Irish company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of
two years from the date the Northern Irish company grants the security interest or guarantee.

However, a Northern Irish Court generally will not intervene if a company entered into the transaction in good
faith for the purpose of carrying on its business and if at the time it did so there were reasonable grounds for
believing the transaction would benefit the company. The Issuer cannot assure holders of the New Notes that in
the event of insolvency, the granting of the security by the NI Obligor would not be challenged by a liquidator or
administrator or that a court would support the analysis that (in any event) the guarantee was entered into in good

376


-----

faith for the purposes described above. If a Northern Irish Court determines that the transaction was a transaction
at an undervalue, a Northern Irish Court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would
have been in if the transaction had not been entered into. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator
to demonstrate that the Northern Irish company was insolvent unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a
connected person (as defined in the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, as amended), in which case there
is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate the solvency of the Northern Irish
company in such proceedings to rebut such a presumption.

_Preference_

Under Northern Irish insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a Northern Irish company could apply to a
Northern Irish Court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or
administrator believes that the creation of such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. There
will only be a preference if, at the time the transaction was entered into, the Northern Irish company was unable
to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, as amended) or the Northern Irish
company becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, as
amended) as a consequence of its entry into the transaction. The transaction can be challenged if the Northern
Irish company enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of six months (if the
beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected
person, except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company's employee)
from the date the Northern Irish company takes the decision to grant the security interest or the guarantee.

A transaction will constitute a preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the Northern Irish company
(or a surety or Obligor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the
company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, Obligor or surety would otherwise have been in had
that transaction not been entered into. If a Northern Irish Court determines that the transaction constituted such a
preference, a Northern Irish Court has very wide powers for restoring the position to what it would have been if
that preference had not been given, which could, in this case, include reducing payments under the New Notes
and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees (although there is protection for a Third-party who enters into one of
the transactions in good faith and without notice). However, for a Northern Irish Court to do so, it must be shown
that in deciding to give the preference the Northern Irish company was influenced by a desire to produce the
preferential effect. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the Northern
Irish company was insolvent at the relevant time and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the
preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case there is a
presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the connected
person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence.

_Transaction Defrauding Creditors_

Under Northern Irish insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and the court
is satisfied that it was made for the substantial purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is
making, or may make, a claim against the company in question, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a
person in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the
court as a transaction defrauding creditors. An application to a Northern Irish Court for an order to set aside the
transaction may be made by an administrator, a liquidator and, subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial
Conduct Authority, the UK Prudential Regulation Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator (with the leave of
the court if the company is in liquidation or administration). In addition, any person who is, or who is capable of
being, prejudiced by the transaction may (with the leave of a Northern Irish Court in the case of a company in
administration or liquidation) also bring an application to set aside such transaction. There is no time limit in the
Northern Irish insolvency legislation within which the challenge must be made and the relevant company does
not need to be insolvent at the time of the transaction.

If a Northern Irish Court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, a Northern Irish
Court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had
not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction, which may include reducing
payments due under the relevant notes or setting aside security interests or guarantees. The relevant court order
may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom
the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was
acquired from a Third-party in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances and will not
require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the

377


-----

relevant circumstances, to pay any sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company unless such person was
a party to the transaction.

_Extortionate Credit Transactions_

An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. A credit
transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of
it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain
contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of
fair dealing. It is presumed, unless otherwise proved by the person extending the credit, that a transaction with
respect to which and administrator or liquidator makes an application to set aside an extortionate credit
transactions is extortionate. The court can made an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into
by a company up to three years before the day on which a company entered administration or liquidation. That
order may set aside, either in whole or in part, any obligation created by the transaction (which could include
obligations of sureties). It may also vary the terms of the transaction of the terms of any security for the purposes
of the transaction. The court may require any party to the transaction to repay to the liquidator or administrator
sums already paid under the transaction and it may order the surrender of any security held for the purpose of the
transaction. It should be noted that there are no provisions for the protection of third parties who acquire interests
in the extortionate credit transaction (e.g. assignees of the benefit of the transaction from the person who provided
credit under it).

_Avoidance of Floating Charge_

Under Northern Irish insolvency law, if a Northern Irish company is unable to pay its debts at the time of (or as a
result of) granting a floating charge, and the floating charge was granted within the specified period referred to
below, then such floating charge can be avoided except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods
or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant Northern Irish company at the
same time as or after the creation of the floating charge.

The requirement for the Northern Irish company to be insolvent at the time of (or as a result of) granting the
floating charge does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. If the floating charge
is granted to a connected person, and the floating charge was granted within the specified period referred to below,
then the floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services
supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant Northern Irish company at the same time as
or after the creation of the floating charge, whether the relevant Northern Irish company is solvent or insolvent.

The granting of the floating charge can be challenged only if the relevant Northern Irish company enters into
liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of one year (if the beneficiary is not a connected person)
or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the relevant Northern Irish company grants
the floating charge. However, if the floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral agreement” under
the 2003 Regulations, the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph.

**_Fixed Versus Floating Charges_**

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security: (a) an
administrator appointed to a charging company can (without the floating charge holder’s consent) convert floating
charge assets to cash and use such cash, or use cash subject to a floating charge, to meet administration expenses
(which can include the costs of continuing to operate the business of the charging company) while in
administration in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder; (b) a fixed charge, even if created after the
date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the floating charge over the charged assets; (c) general costs
and expenses (including the remuneration of a liquidator) properly incurred in a winding up are payable out of the
assets of the charging company (including the assets the subject of the floating charge) in priority to floating
charge claims; (d) until the floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are
subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively
disposed of by the charging company so as to give a Third-party good title to the assets free of the floating charge
and so as to give rise to the risk of security being granted over such assets in priority to the floating charge security;
(e) there are particular challenges / risks in relation to floating charge security; and (f) floating charge security is
subject to the claims of preferential creditors (such as occupational pension scheme contributions, certain tax debts
due to HMRC and wages/ salaries (including holiday pay) owed to employees) and to ring fencing (see above “—
_Administration and Floating Charges”). The reintroduction of Crown preference in December 2020 moved_

378


-----

HMRC to rank as a secondary preferential creditor in relation to certain tax debts on insolvency, these debts rank
after monies owed to fixed charge holders and ordinary preferential creditors but ahead of floating charge holders.

Under insolvency laws in Northern Ireland, there is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed security
interests expressed to be created by a security document could take effect as floating charges because the
description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether fixed security interests will be upheld as
fixed rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the chargee has the
requisite degree of control over the ability of the relevant chargor to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds
thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal
with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in
question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.

**_Disclaimer_**

A Northern Irish liquidator has the power to disclaim onerous property, which is any unprofitable contract or other
property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform
any other onerous act by serving the prescribed notice on the relevant party. A contract may be unprofitable if it
gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on a company that may be
detrimental to creditors.. A contract will not be unprofitable merely because it is financially disadvantageous or
because the company could have made, or could make, a better bargain. However, this power to disclaim onerous
property does not apply to an executed contract nor can it, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing
the company from any liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person. Any person suffering loss or
damage in consequence of the operation of the disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company and may
prove for the loss or damage in the winding up. The critical feature is that the performance of future obligations
would prejudice the liquidator’s obligation to realize the assets and make a distribution to creditors.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

The grant of a guarantee or Collateral by the Northern Irish Obligors in respect of the obligations of another group
company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the
respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that these documents do not allow
such an action, there is a risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void
and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third-parties if they are
dealing with the Northern Irish Obligors in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties
in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for the Northern Irish Obligor in question with
respect to its entry into entering the proposed transaction must be of corporate benefit for the Northern Irish
Obligors. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that (s)he considers,
in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the Northern Irish Obligors for the benefit of its
members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit,
they may be found to have abused their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set
aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the
directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do
not prescribe when directors’ duties to creditors arise, the Court of Appeal has held that the shift takes place when
the directors know, or should know, that the company in question is or is likely to become insolvent, with “likely”
in this context meaning “probable.”

Under the Companies Act 2006, subject to limited exceptions, any security (including security not governed by
Northern Irish law) granted by a company incorporated in Northern Ireland (together with prescribed particulars
of the security constituted thereby) must be received by the Registrar of Companies in Northern Ireland for
registration within 21-days after the date of creation of the security constituted by the applicable security
document. Such security, if not registered within the 21-day period, will be deemed to be void against a liquidator,
administrator or a creditor of the company. When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be
secured by such security is deemed to become immediately payable.

In the event that the relevant security document is not registered, the company may be required to enter into a new
security document and register it with Companies House within 21 days of its creation.

In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the Northern Irish courts for an order allowing the charge
to be registered after the 21-day period has expired. An application for such an order can be made by the company
or by any person interested in the relevant security. The court will grant leave to register the security out of time
if it considers it “just and expedient” to do so, and will have particular regard to whether the failure to register

379


-----

was merely accidental and whether a late registration will prejudice the position of creditors or shareholders. The
court order will have to be enclosed with any delayed application for registration of the security. Security granted
by non-Northern Irish companies over assets in Northern Ireland does not need to be registered with the Registrar
of Companies at Companies House (although they may still need to be registered with the applicable asset
registry).

Guarantees and security granted by a company are also subject to limitations to the extent they would result in
unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of the Companies Act 2006.

**_Moratoriums_**

As outlined above, certain of the insolvency processes available in Northern Ireland provide for the automatic or
optional moratorium imposing a period of time during which third parties including creditors are unable to institute
or continue legal action against the company, enforce certain rights and/or call upon security or guarantees.
Besides the moratorium available to companies undergoing administration (see “Administration” above),
moratoriums are also available to companies entering liquidation (see “Liquidation/winding-up” above)..

**_Foreign Currency_**

Under Northern Irish insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their debts,
the office-holder must convert all foreign currency denominated proofs of debt into sterling at a single rate for
each currency determined by the office-holder by reference to the exchange rates prevailing at the date when the
company went into liquidation or administration. This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. If
a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court; if, on hearing the application, the
court finds that the rate is unreasonable, it may itself determine the rate.

Accordingly, in the event that the NI Obligor enters liquidation or administration, holders of the notes may be
subject to exchange rate risk between the date on which the NI Obligor enters into liquidation or administration
and receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the notes may become entitled. Any losses resulting from
currency fluctuations are not recoverable from the insolvent estate.

**_Reliance on Ipso Facto Clauses Restricted_**

CIGA inserted a new permanent measure for the protection of supplies of goods and services into the Insolvency
(Northern Ireland) Order 1989. The measure provides that a provision of a contract for the supply of goods or
services which permits the supplier to terminate the contract or the supply, or do any other thing (e.g. impose
amended terms), on the grounds that the counterparty becomes subject to a relevant insolvency procedure, will be
void. A relevant insolvency procedure for this purpose includes winding-up proceedings, administration, the
standalone moratorium and the new restructuring plan procedure, but not a scheme of arrangement.

Other rights to terminate under the contract (i.e. other than as a result of the counterparty being subject to a relevant
insolvency procedure) are preserved, to the extent the termination event arises after commencement of the
insolvency proceeding. A supplier may be allowed to terminate the contract if the company or the relevant
insolvency practitioner consents or if permission is granted by the court on it being satisfied that the continuation
of the contract would cause the supplier hardship.

Certain exclusions apply, including for contracts involving financial services (which includes contracts for the
provision of financial services consisting of lending and contracts for the purchase or sale of a security).

**_Cross-border recognition of Northern Irish insolvency and restructuring proceedings_**

_General position_

The recognition of Northern Irish insolvency and restructuring proceedings in other jurisdictions is governed by
applicable treaties in respect of the mutual recognition (or otherwise) of courts’ jurisdiction, proceedings and
judgments and general principles of private international law such as comity and conflicts of laws rules applicable
in the relevant jurisdictions.

One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the “Model
_Law”), which has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States and Great Britain, where_
it was implemented by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations. The Model Law provides for recognition of
certain British insolvency proceedings in other signatory states as either foreign main proceedings (if the COMI

380


-----

of the relevant debtor is determined to be in Great Britain) or foreign non-main proceedings (if the COMI is
determined to be in another jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in Great Britain) upon application by
the relevant insolvency officeholder. The nature and scope of the recognition will depend on the way that the
Model Law has been implemented into the domestic law of the jurisdiction in question. Conversely, the CrossBorder Insolvency Regulations provide for recognition in the UK of foreign insolvency proceedings as either main
proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in the jurisdiction where the debtor has its COMI) or non-main
proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in a jurisdiction in which the debtor has only an establishment).

The recognition of Northern Irish courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement, which are
restructuring rather than insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the
jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention
on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 (the “Hague Convention”) and the Lugano Convention 2007 (the “Lugano
_Convention”) (subject to the UK’s pending application to accede to the latter) where these apply. In addition,_
recognition may still be available under principles of private international law and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008
of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations
(“Rome I”).

The recognition of Northern Irish courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans is a developing
area of law. It remains to be seen whether restructuring plans will fall within the scope of treaties regarding matters
relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague
Convention and the Lugano Convention, or whether they will be treated more akin to insolvency and restructuring
proceedings and fall within related exceptions to such treaties.

_Recognition in the EU_

Following the UK’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the Transition Period, UK proceedings no longer
benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in EU member states. As the trade and cooperation terms
agreed between the EU and the UK do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of
UK insolvency procedures across the EU (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border
insolvencies involving the UK and one or more EU member states will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and
increased complexity.

Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more problematic for UK
restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU member states and for UK office holders to
effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. The general position outlined above will apply and
recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant EU member state and the
need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in
cases where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than
COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be recognized in other EU member states. To the
extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of contract law, Rome I may offer an alternative
basis for recognition in EU member states.

As a consequence, the recognition of Northern Irish insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the EU
member states may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the UK was a member
state of the EU. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be recognized
and whether investors may be adversely affected as a result. For instance, although some member states have their
own laws, or bilateral treaties with the UK, that might enable recognition of a Northern Irish scheme, the number
of these states is limited and the application of these laws and treaties to schemes is untested.

**Belgium**

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

To the extent any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor has its registered seat in Belgium (a “Belgian Guarantor”), or
to the extent Belgium is the territory in which the centre of such Belgian Guarantor’s main interests is situated,
main insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Belgium. This also applies to any debtor for which Belgium is
the territory in which the centre of such debtor’s main interests is situated. Such proceedings would then be
governed by Belgian law. Under certain circumstances, the EU Insolvency Regulation and Belgian law also allows
territorial bankruptcy proceedings to be opened in Belgium over the assets of companies whose centre of main
interests is not situated in Belgium. The effects of those territorial bankruptcy proceedings are restricted to the

381


-----

assets situated in Belgium. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Belgian insolvency law to the
extent relevant in the context of the present transaction.

Belgian insolvency laws provide for two main insolvency proceedings for enterprises: judicial reorganization
proceedings (gerechtelijke _reorganisatie/réorganisation_ _judiciaire)_ and bankruptcy proceedings
(faillissement/faillite).

Both types of insolvency proceedings are governed by Book XX “Insolvency of enterprises” of the Belgian Code
of Economic Law (the “Belgian Insolvency Act”).

Belgium is currently implementing the Directive (EU) 2019/1023 on restructuring and insolvency. The
implementation will have an impact on the available reorganization proceedings. However, the date of
implementation is still uncertain and no official legal texts are available yet.

**_Judicial Reorganization_**

A debtor (and in limited circumstances, its creditors, interested third parties or the public prosecutor) may file a
petition for judicial reorganization if the continuity of the enterprise is at risk, whether immediately or in the
future. If the net assets of the company have fallen under 50% of the company’s registered capital
(kapitaal/capital), the continuity of the enterprise is always presumed to be at risk. A state of bankruptcy of the
debtor does not exclude that a petition for judicial reorganization is filed.

As from the filing of the petition and as long as the court overseeing a judicial reorganization has not issued a
ruling on the reorganization petition, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt (save in case the debtor files a
declaration of bankruptcy itself) or wound up by court order. In addition, during the period between the filing of
the petition and the court’s decision, with few exceptions, none of the debtor’s assets may be disposed of by any
of its creditors as a result of the enforcement of any security interests that such creditors may hold with respect to
such assets. The filing of the petition does not, however, have a suspensory effect if the debtor requested the
opening of judicial reorganization proceedings less than six months ago (unless the court decides otherwise).

The Belgian Insolvency Act provides that, within a period of 15 days as from the filing of the petition, the court
will examine such petition, and within eight days following such examination and subject to the satisfaction of
the filing conditions, the court will declare the judicial reorganization procedure open, allowing a temporary
moratorium for a maximum period of six months. At the request of the debtor (or of the judicial trustee in case of
a procedure of transfer under judicial authority) and pursuant to the report issued by the delegated judge, the
moratorium period can thereafter be extended up to twelve-months as from the start of the moratorium period. In
exceptional circumstances (such as due to the size of the business, the complexity of the case or the impact of the
procedure on employment), and in the interest of the creditors, the court may order an additional extension of the
moratorium period for six months. Special rules apply when a debtor has already requested and obtained a judicial
reorganization procedure in the last three years before the new request.

The granting of the temporary moratorium operates as a stay. No enforcement measures with respect to preexisting
claims (i.e. for debts incurred before the judgment opening the judicial reorganization procedure) in the
moratorium can be continued or initiated against any of the debtor’s movable and immovable assets from the time
that the moratorium is granted until the end of the period, with few exceptions. During the moratorium, no
attachments can be made with regard to preexisting claims. During the moratorium, the debtor can also not be
declared bankrupt, except upon declaration of the debtor itself and, if the debtor is a legal entity, judicial
dissolution will not be possible during this period.

Conservatory attachments that existed prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization retain their conservatory
character, but the court may order their release, provided that such release does not have a material adverse effect
on the situation of the creditor concerned. If the date for the forced sale of moveable or immovable property has
already been set, such sale may, under certain conditions, be continued.

If receivables are pledged by the debtor in favor of a creditor prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization
procedure, such pledge will not be affected by the moratorium, provided that the receivables are pledged
specifically to that creditor from the moment when the pledge is created. The holder of such pledged receivables
is permitted to take enforcement measures against the estate of the initial counterparty of the debtor (such as the
debtor’s customers) during the moratorium. A pledge on financial instruments within the meaning of the Financial
Collateral Act of December 15, 2004 (the “Belgian Financial Collateral Act”), such as shares in the Belgian
Guarantor, can be enforced notwithstanding the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium (unless
considered an abuse of right). In the case of a pledge on bank accounts, the enforcement prohibition applies, save

382


-----

in the event of payment default or if certain other conditions are met. Personal guarantees granted by third parties
in favor of the debtor’s creditors are not covered by the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium, nor
are the debts payable by co debtors, subject to certain exceptions or qualifications in respect of guarantees granted
by individuals. The moratorium also does not prevent the voluntary payment by the debtor of claims covered by
the moratorium, to the extent such payment is necessary for the continuity of the enterprise.

During the judicial reorganization proceedings, the board of directors and management of the debtor continue to
exercise their management functions, albeit under the limited supervision of the court. However, upon request of
the debtor, the court may appoint a judicial mediator (ondernemingsbemiddelaar/médiateur d’entreprise) to
facilitate the restructuring of all or part of its assets or its activities. In addition, upon request of any interested
party or the public prosecutor, in the event of manifestly grave shortcomings of the debtor or one of its corporate
bodies threatening the continuity of the enterprise facing difficulties or its economic activities and provided such
measure can preserve such continuity, the court may appoint a judicial administrator
(gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de justice). Finally, in the event of manifestly gross error of the debtors or one
of its corporate bodies, the court may replace them with a temporary administrator (voorlopig
_bewindvoerder/administrateur provisoire) for the duration of the moratorium._

The reorganization procedure aims to preserve the continuity of a company as a going concern. Consequently, the
initiation of the procedure does not terminate any contracts, and contractual provisions which provide for the early
termination or acceleration of the contract upon the initiation or approval of a reorganization procedure, and
certain contractual terms such as default interest, may not be enforceable during such a procedure. Such
enforcement prohibition applies, with a few exceptions, to close out netting provisions as well, if the judicial
reorganization procedure affects (i) a corporate debtor which is not a public or financial legal entity in the meaning
of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act or (ii) a public or financial legal entity where the creditor is not such an
entity. Moreover, the Belgian Insolvency Act provides that a creditor may not terminate a contract on the basis of
a debtor’s default that occurred prior to the reorganization procedure if the debtor remedies such default within a
15 day period following the notification of such default after granting of the moratorium.

As an exception to the general rule of continuity of contracts, the debtor may cease performing a contract during
the reorganization proceedings, provided that the debtor notifies the creditor and the decision is necessary for the
debtor to be able to propose a reorganization plan to its creditors or to transfer all or part of the company or its
assets. The exercise of this right does not prevent the creditor from suspending the performance of its own
obligations. The creditor can however not terminate the agreement solely on the ground that the debtor has
suspended the performance of its own obligations.

The Belgian Insolvency Act provides for three types of reorganization: (i) an amicable settlement between the
debtor and two or more of its creditors; (ii) a collective agreement; or (iii) the transfer of (part of) the activities.
The type of reorganization may change during the proceedings and may also depend on the position of the court
and/or third parties.

In the case of an amicable settlement, only the parties to such amicable settlement will be bound by the terms they
have agreed. Such in court agreement requires unanimity among the creditors concerned. The debtor may petition
the court to grant a grace period in respect of its payment obligations, e.g., in relation to interest payments, pending
the negotiation of the agreement. Once agreement is reached, the court will record it. The court order confirming
the existence of an amicable settlement will be published, without disclosing the content of the agreement, and its
terms will only be binding upon the creditors that have agreed to it.

In the case of a judicial reorganization by collective agreement, the creditors agree to a reorganization plan during
the reorganization procedure. The plan may include measures such as the reduction or rescheduling of liabilities
and interest obligations and the swap of debt into equity. The reorganization plan must be filed with the electronic
registry managed by the Belgian bar associations (www.regsol.be) at least 20 days in advance of the date on which
the creditors will vote its approval. The court needs to ratify the reorganization plan prior to it taking effect. A
reorganization plan approved by a double majority of the creditors (both in headcount and in value of the claims)
and by the court will bind all creditors, including those who voted against it or did not vote and whether secured
or not, although only limited measures can be imposed by such reorganization plan on secured creditors without
their individual consent. The court may refuse ratification if the formalities were not complied with, or if the
proposed reorganization plan violates public policy.

To enable the court to correctly invite all creditors to the vote, within a period of eight days following the ruling
declaring the judicial reorganization proceedings open, the debtor must inform each of its creditors individually
of the amount of their claims against the debtor as recorded in the books of the debtor, as well as of details

383


-----

regarding security interests, if applicable. Creditors with preexisting claims, as well as any other interested party
that claims to be a creditor, can challenge the amounts and the ranking of the secured claims declared by the
debtor. The court can determine the disputed amounts and the ranking of such claims on a preliminary basis for
the purpose of the reorganization procedure. In addition, the court can at any moment, in case of absolute necessity
and upon request by the debtor or the creditor, change its decision determining the amount or the ranking of the
claim on the basis of new elements. If a creditor has not challenged the amount and the ranking of its claim at
least one month in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval of the reorganization plan,
the amount of its claim will remain unchanged for voting purposes as well as for the purposes of the reorganization
plan.

The debtor must use the moratorium period to complete and finalize a reorganization plan, with the assistance of
the court appointed administrator, if applicable. The plan may include measures such as the reduction or
rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations and the swap of debt into equity and may be based on a limited
(justified) differentiated treatment of certain various categories of liabilities.

The court ordered transfer of all or part of the debtor’s enterprise can be requested by the debtor in its petition or
at a later stage in the procedure. It can be requested by the public prosecutor, by a creditor or by any party who
has an interest in acquiring, in whole or in part, the debtor’s enterprise, and the court can order such transfer in
specific circumstances.

The court ordered transfer will be organized by a judicial administrator (gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de
_justice) appointed by the court. Following the transfer, the recourse of the creditors will be limited to the transfer_
price, subject to some limited exceptions.

On March 21, 2021, the Belgian Parliament adopted a new act amending the Belgian Insolvency Act introducing
a number of new measures, most notably a “pre-packaged insolvency” (voorbereidend akkoord/accord
_préparatoire) (the “Pre-Pack”) procedure, where the debtor may discretely prepare for judicial reorganisation_
proceedings under the supervision of a judicial administrator. These measures were initially adopted for a limited
period ending on 30 June 2021. Pursuant to a Royal Decree of 12 July 2022 extending articles 2, and 4 to, and
including, 12 of the Belgian Code of Economic Law and the Income Tax Code of 1992, those measures were
extended until 31 March 2023.

The purpose of the Pre-Pack is to confidentially test the possibility of an amicable or collective arrangement with
a debtor’s most important creditors prior to formal insolvency proceedings.

This occurs during a Pre-pack phase, i.e. a court supervised preparatory negotiation phase. If the negotiations in
this Pre-pack phase are successful, the Pre-pack phase will be converted into the formal judicial reorganisation
proceedings (aimed at obtaining either an amicable agreement with two or more creditors, or a collective
reorganisation agreement that is approved by the majority of creditors representing the majority of the claims and
binding on dissenting creditors).

The Pre-Pack consists of the following features. A debtor may initiate the Pre-pack procedure by filing a petition
with the President of the competent enterprise court, substantiating that its continuity is at risk immediately or in
the short term.

To ensure confidentiality, the petition is “unilateral” (meaning that creditors are not summoned to share their
views on the petition) and will be decided upon by the President in a hearing behind closed doors (held within 8
days from the date of the petition). The subsequent decision of the President is not published in the Belgian Official
Gazette. Opposition by third parties is not possible.

If the President decides to refuse the Pre-pack petition, the debtor may appeal such decision within 8 Business
Days after being notified of that decision.

If the President decides to approve the Pre-pack petition, the President will appoint a judicial administrator. After
the appointment of the judicial administrator (which is not published), the debtor must produce a list of creditors
and disclose such list to the judicial administrator.

The judicial administrator will subsequently assist the debtor in negotiating an amicable agreement, or a collective
restructuring plan with either all or some of the creditors.

During the Pre-pack phase, the debtor remains in control and may terminate the Pre-pack procedure at any time.

384


-----

If the negotiations conducted by the judicial administrator are successful, the President of the enterprise court will
refer the matter to the insolvency chamber of the enterprise court for the formal opening of judicial reorganisation
proceedings. Subsequently, an amicable agreement might be sanctioned (“homologated”) by the court, or the
collective restructuring plan might be put to the creditors’ vote.

Once referred, the judicial reorganisation proceedings are carried out in an expedited manner. Within 5 Business
Days after referral, the enterprise court will initiate formal judicial reorganisation proceedings.

In the event of an amicable agreement, the enterprise court will decide on confirming or rejecting the amicable
settlement within one month.

In the event of a collective restructuring agreement, the creditors will vote on a restructuring plan and the court
will decide on confirming or rejecting the collective agreement within 3 months.

At the request of the judicial administrator, during the Pre-pack procedure, the President of the enterprise court
may subject unwilling or malicious creditors to payment terms and/or payment conditions as well as stay
enforcement measures for a maximum period of four months.

As soon as the matter is referred to the insolvency chamber of the enterprise court, the debtor-company will enjoy
the full suspension period (moratorium) offered by the formal judicial reorganisation proceedings (i.e. during
which enforcement measures against the company’s assets – for debts incurred before the opening of the judicial
reorganisation proceedings – will be suspended).

**_Bankruptcy_**

Bankruptcy proceedings may be initiated by the debtor, by unpaid creditors, upon the initiative of the public
prosecutor’s office, by the provisional administrator of the debtor’s assets, by the liquidator of the debtor’s assets
or by the liquidator of “main insolvency proceedings” opened in another EU member state (other than Denmark)
in accordance with the EU Insolvency Regulation. Once the court ascertains that the requirements for bankruptcy
are met, the court will establish a date by which all creditors’ claims must be submitted to the court for verification.

Conditions for a bankruptcy order (faillietverklaring/déclaration de faillite) are that the debtor must be in a
situation of sustained cessation of payments (op duurzame wijze opgehouden hebben te betalen/cessation de
_paiements de manière persistante) and be unable to obtain further credit (wiens krediet geschokt is/ébranlement_
_de crédit). Cessation of payments is generally accepted to mean that the debtor is not able to pay its debts as they_
fall due. Such a situation must be persistent and not merely temporary. In bankruptcy, the debtor loses all authority
and decision rights concerning the management of the bankrupt business. The bankruptcy receiver
(curator/curateur), appointed by the court, becomes responsible for the operation of the business and implements
the sale of the debtor’s assets, the distribution of the sale proceeds to creditors and the liquidation of the debtor.
The rights of creditors in the process are limited to being informed of the course of the bankruptcy proceedings
on a regular basis by the receiver. Creditors may oppose the sale of assets by bringing an action before the court,
or may request the temporary continued operation of the business.

The receiver must decide whether or not to continue performance of ongoing contracts (i.e., contracts existing
before the bankruptcy order). The receiver may only decide not to continue performance of one or several ongoing
contracts when the administration of the estate requires this and such decisions will not impair any rights in rem
of third parties that are enforceable against the estate. The other party to an ongoing contract may demand the
receiver to take a decision within fifteen days. If no extension of the 15 days term is agreed upon or if the receiver
does not take any decision, the ongoing contract is presumed to be terminated after the expiration of the 15 days
term. If the receiver decides not to continue performance of an ongoing contract or if an ongoing contract is
terminated due to the expiration of the fifteen days term, the other party to the contract may be entitled to claim
damages, in which case its claim will rank pari passu with claims of all other unsecured creditors.

The receiver may elect to continue the business of the debtor, provided the receiver obtains the authorization of
the court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors. However, two exceptions apply:

- the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an early
termination or acceleration event; and

- _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an essential_
element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy judgment since

385


-----

the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties can agree to continue to
perform under such contract.

As a general rule, the enforcement rights of individual creditors are suspended upon the rendering of the court
order opening bankruptcy proceedings, and after such order is made, only the bankruptcy trustee may proceed
against the debtor and liquidate its assets. However, such suspension does not apply to a pledge on financial
instruments or cash held on account falling within the scope of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act. Further
exceptions exist with regard to estate debts (boedelschulden/dettes de la masse).

For creditors with claims secured by movable assets, such suspension would normally be limited to the period
required for the verification of the claims. At the request of the bankruptcy receiver, the suspension period may
be extended for up to one year from the bankruptcy judgment. Such extension requires a specific order of the court
which can only be made if the further suspension will allow for a realization of the assets in the interest of all
creditors without prejudicing the secured creditors and provided that those secured creditors have been given the
opportunity to be heard by the court.

For creditors with claims secured by immovable assets, the intervention of the bankruptcy receiver is necessary
to pursue the sale of the assets. The receiver will do so upon an order of the court, given either at its request or at
the request of a mortgagee. A first-ranking mortgagee will generally be entitled to pursue the enforcement of its
mortgage as soon as the report of claims has been finalized; the court may suspend such enforcement for a period
of not more than one year from the date of the bankruptcy if the suspension will allow for a realization of the
assets without prejudicing the mortgagee provided that the mortgagee has been given the opportunity to be heard
by the court. However, a pledge on financial instruments or cash held on accounts can be enforced during the
suspension period.

If a security interest, such as a pledge, has been granted over assets that, at the time of opening of an insolvency
proceeding, are located in another EU member state, the rights the creditor has under such security shall, in
accordance with the EU Insolvency Regulation, not be affected by the opening of such insolvency proceedings.

As from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, no further interest accrues against the bankrupt debtor on its
unsecured debt, or debts secured by a general privilege, like tax administration or social security. The debts of the
bankrupt estate generally will be ranked as to priority on the basis of complex rules. The following is a general
overview of only the main principles:

- _Estate debt: Costs and indebtedness incurred by the receiver during the bankruptcy proceedings, the so_
called “estate debts,” have senior priority. In addition, if the receiver has contributed to the realization and
enforcement of secured assets, such costs will be paid to the receiver in priority out of the proceeds of the
realized assets before distributing the remainder to the secured creditors.

- _Security interests: Creditors that hold a security interest have a priority right over the secured asset (whether_
by means of appropriation of the asset or on the proceeds upon realization).

- _Privileges: Creditors may have a particular privilege on certain or all assets (such as tax claims, claims for_
social security premiums, etc.). Privileges on specific assets rank before privileges on all assets of the
debtor. Certain privileges prevail over the security interests.

- _Unsecured creditors (pari passu): Once all estate debts and creditors having the benefit of security interests_
and privileges have been satisfied, the proceeds of the remaining assets will be distributed by the receiver
among the unsecured creditors who rank pari passu (unless a creditor agreed to be subordinated).

- Subordinated creditors will receive the remainder (if any).

**_Subsidiary Guarantee/Collateral_**

The grant of a Guarantee or Senior Notes Collateral by a Belgian Guarantor for the obligations of another group
company must fall within the grantor’s legal and corporate purpose and be for the own corporate benefit of the
Belgian Guarantor and comply with any applicable financial assistance rules. Corporate benefit is not a welldefined concept under Belgian law and its interpretation is left to the courts and legal authors. The corporate
benefit rules and their application in the context of granting guarantees or collateral for the benefit of a group
company are not clearly established under Belgian law and there is only limited case law on this issue.

386


-----

The question of corporate benefit must be determined on a case by case basis by reference to the prevailing factual
circumstances. Consideration has to be given to any direct and/or indirect benefit that the company would actually
derive from the transaction and is particularly relevant for upstream or cross stream guarantees and collateral. It
is generally taught by legal scholars that such benefit should be proportionally greater than the risk for the
company resulting from the granting and/or enforcement of the guarantee concerned. The financial support
granted by the company should not exceed its financial capabilities. Belgian case law does not offer clear
guidelines on when a group transaction is within the individual group member’s corporate benefit and when
aforementioned conditions are met.

Whether or not the corporate benefit requirement is met is a matter of fact to be assessed by the board of directors
of the Belgian Guarantor. The corporate benefit justification by the company’s board of directors will be subject
to only a “marginal review” by the courts; in insolvency situations, however, the courts can be expected to take a
more critical view.

If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the directors of the company may be held liable under civil law (i)
by the company for negligence in the management and (ii) by third parties in tort and under criminal law in certain
specific circumstances (i.e., where the specific facts can be qualified as “abuse of company goods” (misbruik van
_vennootschapsgoederen/abus de bien sociaux)). Moreover, the guarantee or security interest could be declared_
null and void and, under certain circumstances, the creditor that benefits from the guarantee or security interest
could be held liable if the corporate benefit requirement is not met and the creditor knew or should have known
this. Alternatively, the guarantee or collateral could be reduced to an amount corresponding to the corporate
benefit. These rules have been seldom tested under Belgian law, and there is only limited case law on this issue.

In order to enable Belgian subsidiaries to grant a guarantee and collateral to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect
parent or sister company without the risk of violating Belgian rules on corporate benefit, it is standard market
practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain “limitation language” in
relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Belgium. Accordingly, the Guarantee of the Belgian
Guarantor will be limited accordingly. Including such limitation language is, however, not conclusive in
determining or upholding the corporate benefit.

The grant of a guarantee or collateral by a Belgian company must also be within or serve the corporate purpose
and statutory purpose of the Belgian company as described in its articles of association.

**_Financial Assistance_**

Any guarantee granted by a Belgian Guarantor shall not include and shall not extend to cover any payment
obligation in respect of the proceeds of the New Notes arising out of amounts used to fund directly or indirectly
the acquisition of shares of such Belgian Guarantor to the extent that by assuming such obligation the Belgian
Guarantor would be deemed to be providing prohibited financial assistance to the acquisition of its own shares or
capital participations, as prohibited under Article 5:152 or 7:22 of the Belgian Code of Companies and
Associations dated March 23, 2019, as amended from time to time. Therefore, such payment obligations shall be
excluded from the concept of guarantee by a Belgian Guarantor. Any guarantees or security interest granted by a
Belgian Guarantor which constitute a breach of the provisions on financial assistance as defined by Article 5:152
or 7:22 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations dated March 23, 2019, as amended from time to time,
are not enforceable.

**_Hardening Period and Fraudulent Transfer_**

In the event of bankruptcy proceedings governed by Belgian law, the bankruptcy receiver may challenge certain
transactions that have been concluded or performed by the debtor during the so called “hardening period.”

In principle, the cessation of payments (which constitutes a condition for filing for bankruptcy) is deemed to have
occurred as of the date of the bankruptcy order. The court issuing the bankruptcy order may determine, based on
serious and objective indications, that the cessation of payments occurred on an earlier date. Such earlier date may
not be earlier than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order, except in the case where the bankruptcy
order relates to a company that was dissolved more than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order in
circumstances suggesting an intent to defraud its creditors, in which case the date of cessation of payments may
be determined as being the date of such decision to dissolve the company. The period from the date of cessation
of payments up to the declaration of bankruptcy is referred to as the “hardening period” (verdachte
_periode/période suspecte)._

387


-----

The transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period which may be declared ineffective against
third parties include, among others, (i) gratuitous transactions or transactions entered into at an undervalue, (ii)
payments for debts which are not due, (iii) payments other than in cash for debts due, and (iv) security interests
provided for preexisting debts (save for any security granted during the suspension period of judicial
reorganization proceedings).

Other transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period may be declared ineffective against third
parties provided that the counterparty was aware of the debtor’s cessation of payment.

In particular, a guarantee or security interests entered into during the hardening period may be declared ineffective
against third parties (i) if it is regarded as having been granted gratuitously, unbalanced or at an undervalue, (ii)
if the beneficiaries of the guarantee or security interests were aware of the Belgian Guarantor’s cessation of
payments or (iii) if it is granted to secure preexisting debts.

If the guarantee or security interests granted by the Belgian Guarantor were successfully voided (based on the
above), noteholders would cease to have any claim in respect thereof and could be under an obligation to repay
any amounts received pursuant to such guarantee or the enforcement proceeds of the security interests.

Furthermore, even in the absence of bankruptcy proceedings, a Third-party creditor may obtain a court ruling that
an act or transaction (such as a guarantee) is not enforceable against it if it can establish that the challenged act or
transaction was effected with the fraudulent intent to adversely affect its position as an existing creditor (actio
_pauliana)._

Regardless of fraudulent intent, registration of a security interest after cessation of payments can also be declared
ineffective against third parties, when more than 15 days have passed in between the date of the deed and the date
of registration.

**_Recognition and Enforcement_**

The granting of security interests over movable or immovable, tangible or intangible, assets may be subject to
validity and/or enforceability conditions. The breach of any of such conditions may render such security interests
invalid or unenforceable. The foreclosure of security interests may be subject to formalities (e.g. judicial or nonjudicial consent) and may be time consuming in the event that the foreclosure takes place under judicial control
or in the event of a legal dispute. Courts may condition the enforcement of a security interest and/or guarantee
upon the evidence that the creditor has a final and undisputed claim triggering the foreclosure of the security
interest and/or guarantee. Enforcement of security interests and/or guarantees may be hindered by conflict of law
and/or conflict of jurisdiction issues and may not breach any public policy provision and/or mandatory legal
provisions. Courts may require a sworn translation in French or Dutch of the English documents which they may
review.

###### INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The consolidated financial statements of German Topco as of and for each of the financial years ended December
31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft
(PwC), which is a member of the German Chamber of Public Accountants (Wirtschaftsprüferkammer). The
auditor’s address is PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Friedrich Ebert Anlage 35
37, 60327 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

The independent auditor’s reports of PwC for the consolidated financial statements of German Topco as of and
for each of the financial years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, also refer to their respective group
management reports. The group management reports are not included or incorporated by reference in this
Exchange Offer Memorandum. They were prepared by and are the sole responsibility of German Topco’s
management in accordance with German generally accepted accounting principles. The examinations of and the
auditor’s report upon such group management reports are required and were performed in accordance with section
317 of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB) and German generally accepted standards for
the audit of management reports promulgated by the German Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW). Those
examinations were not made in accordance with generally accepted auditing or attestation standards in the United
States. Accordingly, PwC does not express any opinion on this information or on the consolidated financial
statements included in the Exchange Offer Memorandum, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted auditing
standards or U.S. attestation standards. The information contained in such group management reports and the
auditor’s reports upon such group management reports should not be relied upon by U.S. investors.

###### ENFORCEABILITY OF JUDGMENTS

**Germany**

The Issuer and certain of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Germany. Our
directors and executive officers live outside the United States. Virtually all of our assets and the assets of our
directors and executive officers are located outside the United States. As a result, although we have appointed an
agent for service of process under the New Notes Indenture governing the New Notes, it may be difficult for you
to serve process on those persons or us in the United States or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against
them or us based on civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States.

There is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of
the United States, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state
courts. The United States and the Federal Republic of Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the
reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial
matters. The enforceability of final judgments therefore may depend on the laws of the relevant U.S. state and
federal laws of the United States. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any federal or state court
in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not
automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be
recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the
proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German
court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted
below.

German courts will, in particular, not recognize and enforce such judgments if the judgment is not final under
applicable U.S. federal or state law or if any of the reasons for excluding enforceability set forth in section 328(1)
of the German Code of Civil Procedure exist:

- if, pursuant to German law, the U.S. federal or state court having rendered the foreign judgment did not
have jurisdiction;

- if process has not been duly served or has not been served in a timely fashion to permit a defense, provided
that the defendant did not actively participate in such process and pleads accordingly;

- if the judgment is incompatible with a prior judgment rendered by a German court or by a foreign court
which is to be recognized in Germany;

- if the judgment, or the proceeding resulting in the judgment, to be recognized is incompatible with a
proceeding in Germany which was pending (rechtshängig) before a German court before the U.S. federal
or state court entered its judgment;

- if a recognition of the judgment would be obviously incompatible with essential principles of German law,
in particular, if the recognition would be incompatible with the civil rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by
virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and

- if reciprocity is not ensured (i.e., the U.S. federal or state courts would not recognize and enforce a
comparable judgment by a German court in equivalent circumstances).

Subject to the foregoing, holders of the New Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial
matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Germany. There is some German case law to the effect that
reciprocity of the recognition of judgments is ensured in relation to claims relating to assets (vermögensrechtliche
_Ansprüche) with regard to various U.S. states. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments_
in Germany will be successful. It is also doubtful whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose
civil liability in an original action solely predicated by U.S. federal securities laws.

In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages are usually denied by German courts as
incompatible with the essential principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of
damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate
actual losses or damages.

390


-----

Consequently, judgments awarding monetary damages under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal
securities laws may not be enforceable to the extent they provide for a compensation that would qualify as being
of a penal or punitive nature.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In so far as the
production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law
provided for pretrial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the
production of documents by adverse or third parties and/or the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this
matter may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pretrial discovery process exists under German
law.

In addition, it may under certain circumstances also not be possible for investors to effect service of process within
Germany upon the German Notes Guarantors or those persons under the Convention on the Service Abroad of
Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 and the German law
implementing such convention if such service were deemed to infringe German sovereignty or security, which
may be the case if such service violated the fundamental principles of German law, in particular the civil rights
(Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz). However, the German
Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) held in 2013 that service may not be denied solely because the
action before the U.S. court contains claims for punitive damages.

**England and Wales**

The United States and the United Kingdom currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition
and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters.

A final and conclusive judgment for a debt or definite sum of money issued by a federal or state court in the United
States may (subject to the conditions below) be enforced at common law in England and Wales provided that the
party against whom the judgment was given properly submitted to the jurisdiction of the relevant courts in
accordance with English rules on the conflict of laws. In order to enforce any such US judgment in England or
Wales, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England or Wales. In such
an action, the court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the US court
(subject to what is stated below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim
(assuming that there is no good defense to it). However, an English or Welsh court may decline to enforce a US
judgment where:

- the U.S. judgment was procured by fraud;

- the U.S. judgment was given contrary to the English rules of natural or substantial justice, for example the
defendant was not given due notice of the original proceedings or was not given an adequate opportunity to
be heard in the original proceedings, or the defendant did not have the opportunity to correct procedural
irregularities under the laws of the court giving judgment;

- recognition of the U.S. judgment would be contrary to English public policy;

- recognition of the U.S. judgment would violate the Human Rights Act 1998;

- the U.S. judgment conflicts with an earlier English judgment, or foreign judgment that is enforceable in an
English court;

- the proceedings that resulted in the judgment were brought in breach of a binding arbitration agreement or a
contractual choice of court agreement or where recognition or enforcement of the judgment would be
contrary to the terms of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982;

- enforcement of the U.S. judgment would involve the enforcement of foreign taxes, fines or penalties (which
involves payment to the State as distinct from an individual) or revenue or other public law;

- enforcement of the U.S. judgment would contravene Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act
1980, which precludes, among other things, the enforcement by any court in the United Kingdom of any
judgment given by a court of an overseas country which is a judgment for multiple damages which exceed
the compensatory element of the judgment award; or

391


-----

- enforcement of the U.S. judgment is time-barred or outside any relevant limitation periods.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England and Wales judgments in civil and
commercial matters that have been obtained from US federal or state courts. Nevertheless, we cannot assure you
that those judgments will be enforceable in England and Wales.

**The Netherlands**

Centrafarm B.V. is incorporated under Dutch law (the “Dutch Guarantor”). As a result, it may be difficult for
investors to enforce judgments obtained in non-Dutch courts against the Dutch Guarantor.

The Netherlands does not currently have a treaty with the United States providing for reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final
judgment for the payment of money rendered by any court in any federal or state court in the United States based
on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon United States federal securities laws, would not
automatically be recognized or enforceable in The Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is enforceable
in The Netherlands, the claim must be re litigated before a competent Dutch court. Under current practice, the
courts of The Netherlands may be expected to render a judgment in accordance with the judgment of the relevant
U.S. court, provided that such judgment (i) is a final judgment and has been rendered by a court which has
established its jurisdiction vis à vis the Dutch Guarantor on the basis of internationally accepted grounds of
jurisdiction, (ii) has not been rendered in violation of elementary principles of fair trial, (iii) is not contrary to the
public policy (openbare orde) of The Netherlands and (iv) is not incompatible with (a) a prior judgment of a
Dutch court rendered in a dispute between the same parties, or (b) a prior judgment of a non-Dutch court rendered
in a dispute between the same parties, concerning the same subject matter and based on the same cause of action,
provided that such prior judgment is capable of being recognized in The Netherlands.

Moreover, a Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only
to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Enforcement and recognition of
judgments of U.S. courts in The Netherlands are solely governed by the provisions of the Dutch Civil Procedure
Code (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering).

**Republic of Ireland**

As the United States is not any party to a convention with the Republic of Ireland in respect of the enforcement
of judgments, common law rules apply in order to determine whether a judgment of the courts of the State of New
York is enforceable in the Republic of Ireland. A judgment of the courts of the State of New York will be enforced
by the courts of the RoI if the following general requirements are met:

(i) the courts of the State of New York must have had jurisdiction in relation to the particular defendant
according to the Republic of Ireland conflict of law rules (the submission to jurisdiction by the defendant
would satisfy this rule); and

(ii) the judgment must be final and conclusive and the decree must be final and unalterable in the court which
pronounces it. A judgment can be final and conclusive even if it is subject to appeal or even if an appeal is
pending. Where however, the effect of lodging an appeal under the applicable law is to stay execution of
the judgment, it is possible that, in the meantime, the judgment should not be actionable in the Republic of
Ireland. It remains to be determined whether final judgment given in default of appearance is final and
conclusive.

However, the Irish courts may refuse to enforce a judgment of the courts of the State of New York which meets
the above requirements for one of the following reasons:

(iii) if the judgment is not for a definite sum of money;

(iv) if the judgment was obtained by fraud;

(v) the enforcement of the judgment in the Republic of Ireland would be contrary to natural or constitutional
justice;

(vi) the judgment is contrary to the Republic of Ireland public policy or involves certain United States laws
which will not be enforced in the Republic of Ireland; or

392


-----

(vii) jurisdiction cannot be obtained by the Irish courts over the judgment debtors in the enforcement
proceedings by personal service in the Republic of Ireland or outside the Republic of Ireland under Order
11 of the Superior Courts Rules.

Pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2271/96 of November 22, 1996, as amended by Commission
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/1100 (the “Blocking Statute”), no judgment of a court or tribunal and no decision
of an administrative authority located outside of the European Union giving effect, directly or indirectly, to the
laws specified in the annex to the Blocking Statute or to actions based thereon will be recognized or be enforceable
in any manner by the courts of the Republic of Ireland.

**Northern Ireland**

The United States and the UK do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments in civil and commercial matters (although the United States and the UK are both parties to the New
York Convention on Arbitral Awards). Any judgment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States
based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities law, would not be directly
enforceable in Northern Ireland. In order to enforce such a monetary judgment in Northern Ireland, under common
law rules proceedings must be initiated by way of civil law action on the judgment debt before a Northern Irish
Court. Summary judgment may be applied for and in this type of action, a Northern Irish court generally will not
(subject to among other things the matters identified below) reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided
by a U.S. court if:

- the relevant U.S. court had territorial, procedural and substantive jurisdiction (under the UK rules of private
international law applicable to Northern Ireland) to give the judgment; and

- the judgment is final and conclusive on the merits and is for a definite sum of money (not being a sum
payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty or
otherwise based on a U.S. law that a Northern Irish Court considers to be a penal, revenue or other public
law).

- Northern Irish court may refuse to enforce such a judgment for reasons including if it is established that:

- the enforcement of such judgment would contravene natural justice, public policy or statute in Northern
Ireland;

- the enforcement of the judgment is prohibited by statute (including, without limitation, if the amount of
the judgment has been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as
compensation for the loss or damage sustained);

- the Northern Irish proceedings were not commenced within the relevant limitation period;

- before the date on which the U.S. court gave judgment, the issues in question had been the subject a final
judgment of a Northern Irish Court or of a court of another jurisdiction whose judgment is enforceable in
Northern Ireland;

- the judgment has been obtained by fraud or in proceedings in which the principles of natural justice were
breached;

- the bringing of proceedings in the relevant U.S. court was contrary to an agreement under which the dispute
in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in that court (to whose jurisdiction the judgment
debtor did not submit); or

- an order has been made and remains effective under section 9 of the UK Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal
Enforcement) Act 1933, applying that section to U.S. courts, including the relevant U.S. court.

If a Northern Irish Court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the Northern Irish judgment
will be enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. In addition, it may not be possible to obtain
a Northern Irish judgment or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is or becomes subject to any
insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any set-off or counterclaim against the judgment
creditor.

393

Notwithstanding the above there can be no assurance that any judgment described will be recognized or
enforceable in Northern Ireland. In addition there can be no assurance that a Northern Irish Court will accept
jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in Northern Ireland, instead of the
United States, and predicated solely on US federal securities law.

**Belgium**

In the absence of any bilateral or multilateral treaty, a final and enforceable judgment of the courts exercising
jurisdiction in the United States would be recognized and enforced by the courts of Belgium without review on
the merits subject to the conditions specified in Articles 22 to 25 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law
(Wetboek van Internationaal Privaatrecht/Code de Droit International Privé).

Pursuant to Article 24 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law, the following documents must be
produced in court by the claimant:

- an official copy of the judgment (uitgifte van de beslissing/expédition de la décision) fulfilling all
conditions required for its authentication under the applicable foreign law;

- if obtained by default, an original or legalized copy of the document demonstrating that the originating
process has been served on the defendant in accordance with the applicable foreign law or an equivalent
document in accordance with the applicable foreign law demonstration that the judgment was served or
notified to the party that did not appear; and

- any document demonstrating that, under the applicable foreign law, the judgment is enforceable and has
been notified to the defendant.

However, recognition and enforcement can be refused in the circumstances described in Article 25 of the Belgian
Code of Private International Law, and notably if:

- the rights of defense have been violated;

- such recognition or enforcement would be incompatible with Belgian public policy;

- the jurisdiction of the foreign judge was based solely on the presence of the defendant or assets without
any direct connection with the dispute in the foreign state;

- the decision may still be appealed under the applicable foreign law (however, provisional enforcement
could then be granted) or does not meet the requirements of authenticity pursuant to the applicable laws;

- if in relation to matters for which parties cannot freely dispose of their rights, the decision has been sought
with the sole purpose of escaping from the application of the laws applicable in accordance with Belgian
private international law;

- the claim was filed in the United States after the filing in Belgium of a claim that is still pending between
the same parties with respect to the same subject matter;

- the judgment is incompatible with a decision rendered in Belgium or a prior judgment rendered in another
jurisdiction that can be recognized in Belgium;

- Belgian jurisdictions have exclusive jurisdiction in respect of the claim; or

- the decision is in conflict with the rules on the recognition and enforcement of court decisions in relation
to insolvency proceedings, intellectual property or corporate standing.

As a general principle, procedural rules are governed by the law of the jurisdiction of the court (lex fori). In
Belgium the procedural rules set out in, among others, the Belgian Judicial Code and the Belgian Code of Private
International Law will apply when recognition and enforcement of judgments rendered by United States courts is
sought in Belgium.

In the case of an enforcement through legal proceedings in Belgium (including the exequatur of foreign court
decisions in Belgium), a registration tax at the rate of 3% of the amount of the judgment is payable by the debtor,
if the sum of money that the debtor is ordered to pay by a Belgian court, or by a foreign court judgment that is

394


-----

either (i) automatically enforceable and registered in Belgium or (ii) rendered enforceable by a Belgian court,
exceeds €12,500.

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements for the First 6 Months of 2022  |  Notes

## NOTES

##### 1. General

**1.1. Basis of presentation**

The interim consolidated financial statements of Nidda German Topco GmbH and accompanying condensed notes, as of
June 30, 2022, are prepared in accordance with the International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34. The primary financial statements are presented in the format consistent with the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021. The interim
report does not include all the notes of the type normally included in an annual financial statement and should be read in
conjunction with the Annual Report 2021.

The interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Standards and interpretations in
effect on the reporting date, and endorsed in the EU, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and
the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC), for financial periods starting as of January 1, 2022.

The accounting policies used to prepare the interim consolidated financial statements are consistent with those of the previous financial year and corresponding interim reporting period, except for the change described in Note 1.3. and the adoption
of new and amended standards as set out in Note 1.2.

**1.2. New and amended standards adopted by the Group**

For the first half of 2022, there were no recently implemented accounting pronouncements and amendments to pronouncements published by the IASB and endorsed by the EU that had a material effect on the Group’s consolidated financial
statements.

**Impact of standards issued but not yet applied by the Group**

There are no other IFRS standards or interpretations not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on
the consolidated financial statements.

**1.3. Change in estimation methodology used for Goodwill impairment test and certain intangible and**
**tangible assets related to Russia**

The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions imposed against Russia, Russian entities and Russian individuals have
introduced significant uncertainty about the country’s and affected individuals’ ability/willingness to honor their foreign
currency debt obligations. This default risk in combination with abnormally high foreign currency volatility on the capital
market together with sanctions against Russia have resulted in Russia being excluded from the global credit rating system.
Nidda management no longer considers the estimation approach which utilizes a country risk premium to be applicable for
Russia nor a viable indicator of Nidda’s risk for its investment in Russia into a local pharmaceutical company not affected by
sanctions. Any disclosure of an amount resulting from the change of estimate does not provide the investor with any practicable and reliable or relevant information. The estimation approach utilized to prepare its impairment testing for the year
ended December 31, 2021, in accordance with IAS 36.A4-A6, included using a single set of estimated cash flows discounted
with a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) based on a country risk premium applying the relevant country credit ratings,
which in management’s view would lead to an inappropriate representation and measurement of the Group’s assets.

In the beginning of the current half year period management has changed its estimation methodology with respect to Russia,
and applied the expected cash flow approach; rather than discounting a single cash flow projection with a risk-adjusted WACC,
management has taken the uncertainty and risks induced by the Russia/Ukraine crisis into account in the cash flow projection

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements for the First 6 Months of 2022  |  Notes

of the underlying Russian business operations in the form of several scenarios with varying probabilities of occurrence. In
developing the future cash flow scenarios for the Russian business, management considered the following variables: the
development of the foreign exchange rate of the Russian ruble versus the euro and its translational and transactional effects,
the Russian inflation rate and its effect on COGS and OPEX, the ability of Nidda to compensate for the inflationary tendencies
by adjusting pricing activities, the change in market demand and Nidda’s market share as well as the results of its marketing
and sales activities. Based on the varying set of values in these variables, four scenarios have been developed and assigned
with a probability of occurrence which was determined based on expert interviews and analysis of financial market indicators:

- Scenario A (base case) with a probability of 55%: moderate ruble devaluation and inflation with single-digit market
contraction

- Scenario B (downside case) with a probability of 25%: significant ruble devaluation and inflation and double-digit market
contraction

- Scenario C (national bankruptcy case) with a probability of 15%: very significant ruble devaluation and inflation and high
double-digit demand contraction

- Scenario D (expropriation case) with a probability of 5%: worst case with a full discontinuation of the business and cash
flows in Russia

Based on the four different cash-flow scenarios and their probability of occurrence, management has calculated a probabilityweighted cash flow which has then replaced the originally budgeted cash flows of the Russian business. In turn, the Russian
country-risk-premium has been eliminated from the discount-rate considerations since the country risks have been reflected
in the cash flows of the underlying operational business activities. The expected cash flow approach has been applied consistently for all relevant areas, performing goodwill impairment, testing intangible and tangible assets associated with the Russian
business of the Group. The estimation approach for the remaining businesses of the Group remain unchanged, which also
includes the Ukraine as a credit rating is still available and as such a country risk premium can be determined.

**Estimates, assumptions and discretion in the application of the expected cash flow approach:**

The presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations in the interim consolidated financial statements
is determined by recognition and valuation methods. To a certain extent, Nidda makes estimates and assumptions relating to
the future that are based on past experience as well as other factors that are considered appropriate in the particular circumstances. The significant estimates, judgments and related assumptions utilized in the application of the expected cash flow
approach requires management to make explicit assumptions about the development of several parameters which have an
impact on the future cash flows of the underlying (Russian) business in each scenario and requires management to estimate
a probability distribution for each scenario. Although management has thoroughly evaluated the estimates and assumptions,
actual results could differ from those estimates.

**1.4. Scope of consolidation**

The interim consolidated financial statements of the Nidda Group are prepared for Nidda German Topco GmbH as the parent
company.

In the first half of 2022, there have been no material changes in the Group’s consolidation structure.

**1.5. Business combinations**

In the first half of 2022, no business combinations in accordance with IFRS 3 occurred.

**1.6. General business environment**

Despite a challenging operating environment shaped by macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, the Group managed
to continue its successful growth course with double-digit sales and earnings growth in the first half of 2022. Notwithstanding inflationary pressures on goods and services as well as challenges in the procurement of raw materials, due in part to the
conflict in Ukraine, STADA achieved further market share gains.

Despite the ongoing war in Ukraine, STADA was nevertheless able to put the factory near Kiev back into operation in May. The
approximately 440 employees in Ukraine are safe and pharmaceutical deliveries, albeit very limited, have been able to continue
in recent months. Because the supply of pharmaceuticals, medicines, food supplements and other medical products to provide
for basic human needs are explicitly exempt from the sanctions imposed on Russia by the EU, the USA and some other countries, STADA has been able to keep the two Russian production sites in operation and maintain supplies to the population
despite supply chain issues.

**Reported sales for Consumer Healthcare increased by 30% to € 729.2 million in the reporting period (1-6/2021: € 562.6 mil-**
lion). Sales for Consumer Healthcare adjusted for special items as well as currency effects showed an increase of 25% to
€ 729.2 million (1-6/2021: € 582.9 million). Apart from the impact from acquisitions and cooperations, this development was
based on market and market share growth, new product launches as well as price adjustments in a large number of countries.
All top ten countries contributed to this growth with growth rates in the mid single-digit to high double-digit range. Consumer
Healthcare contributed 41% to Group sales (1-6/2021: 37%).

**Reported sales for Specialty increased by 15% to € 341.8 million in the reporting period (1-6/2021: € 297.7 million). Sales**
for Specialty adjusted for special items as well as currency effects showed an increase of 12% to € 341.8 million (1-6/2021:
€ 306.4 million). The growth is mainly attributable to gains in the area of biosimilars, including in particular the successful
launch of the cancer drug Ovayas[®] (bevacizumab biosimilar) and the growth of the osteoporosis drug Movymia[®] (teriparatide
biosimilar), which was already launched in 2020. Another growth driver is the treatment option with Lecigon[®] (an innovative
gel formulation with a fixed combination of levodopa, carbidopa and entacapone for continuous intestinal use in advanced
Parkinson’s disease), which is becoming available to more and more Parkinson’s patients in an increasing number of countries.
Other contributors to growth were forward buying effects and a positive development of sales with Silapo[®] (epoetin biosimilar)
in Germany as well as royalty income from the United States for this product, while Bortezomib[®] is increasingly exposed to
price competition, as expected. Specialty contributed 20% to Group sales (1-6/2021: 20%).

**2.2. Cost of sales and gross profit**

Cost of sales increased to € 1,003.0 million in the reporting period (1-6/2021: € 890.4 million), leading to a gross profit of
€ 765.1 million (1-6/2021: € 616.3 million). The gross margin increased to 43.3% (1-6/2021: 40.9%). The increase was mainly

F-10


-----

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements for the First 6 Months of 2022  |  Notes

the result of cost optimization measures and efficiency improvements throughout the supply chain, whereas the corresponding prior-year period was negatively impacted by pandemic- related factors such as a higher write-down rate. The write-off on
inventory amounted to € 32.8 million for the first 6 months in 2022. Compared with the first half of 2021, the change in the
country and product mix also had a positive impact on gross margin. In addition, price adjustments helped ensure that the
effects of inflation in global procurement markets did not have a significant negative impact on gross margin in the reporting
period.

**2.3. Selling expenses**

Selling expenses showed an increase to € 404.1 million in the first 6 months of 2022 (1-6/2021: € 340.0 million). The increase
reflects both the effect of the partial reduction in sales activities in the previous year due to the pandemic and targeted
investments to expand the product portfolio as well as to increase the market share of the existing portfolio.

**2.4. General and administrative expenses**

General and administrative expenses increased to € 126.3 million in the first 6 months of the current financial year
(1-6/2021: € 117.0 million) and thus at a significantly lower rate than sales growth. The increase was in part due, among other
things, to higher leasing and insurance costs.

**2.5. Research and development expenses**

Research and development expenses totaled € 46.9 million in the first 6 months of 2022 (1-6/2021: € 43.9 million). In addition, development expenses of € 15.2 million for new products were capitalized (1-6/2021: € 11.2 million).

**2.6. Other income**

Other income in the first 6 months of 2022 amounted to € 93.1 million (1-6/2021: € 7.3 million). The increase mainly related
to foreign exchange gains of €64.0 million in connection with a loan for the acquisition of the Takeda product portfolio. Additionally, other income includes appreciation of intangible assets as a result of impairment testing, amounting to € 7.5 million.
The appreciations as a result of positive future prospects in Russia for the respective products are attributable to five approvals
for Specialty products (€ 6.8 million) and one approval in the Consumer Healthcare business (€ 0.7 million).

**2.7. Other expenses**

Other expenses increased to € 662.7 million in the reporting period (1-6/2021: € 42.3 million). The increase was dominantly
driven by impairments of € 642.8 million. The major part of impairment losses relates to the impairment of goodwill of
€ 575.0 million primarily driven by the deterioration of the WACC used for impairment test.

Additionally, impairment losses relate to various pharmaceutical approvals and trademarks as well as tangible assets. The
impairments in the Russian market in the current half year are primarily attributable to four approvals for Specialty products
(€ 15.9 million), seven approvals in the Consumer Healthcare business (€ 14.5 million) and one approval in Generics (€ 6.1 million) due to a mix of the increased interest rate and uncertain future prospects for the Russian market, which are presented
as part of the scenario analysis. Furthermore, impairments occurred for intangible assets and tangible assets in Ukraine due
to the increase in the country market risk premium which led to a significant increase in the country determined WACC. As a
consequence, an impairment for three approvals for Consumer Healthcare products (€ 5.9 million) and for all tangible assets
such as machines and equipment (€ 17.3 million) was recognized.

**2.8. Financial result**

The financial result amounted to -€ 127.4 million in the first 6 months of 2022 (1-6/2021: -€ 137.9 million). The positive
development of the financial result compared to the prior year was partly driven by the recognition of financial income due
to the fair value measurment of an interest rate cap instrument as well as a positive effect recorded as financial income due
to the increase in the underlying discount rate for the fair value measurement of the earn-out liability in connection with the
Lobsor acquisition.

**2.9. Income tax expenses**

Income tax expenses amounted to € 25.0 million in the reporting period (1-6/2021: expense of € 12.2 million). The goodwill
impairment was considered as a discrete item without any corresponding tax effect.

##### 3. Information on the Consolidated Balance Sheet

**3.1. Intangible assets**

Intangible assets decreased by € 460.5 million to € 5,009.2 million as of June 30, 2022 (December 31, 2021: € 5,469.8 million).
The decrease was mainly related to impairments of € 623.0 million recorded in the first 6 months of 2022 and scheduled
amortization.

In the context of the takeover of STADA Arzneimittel AG, goodwill was recognized. The STADA Group is managed as a cashgenerating unit in the Nidda Group, for this reason the goodwill impairment test is carried out at this level.

in € million **June 30, 2022** **Dec. 31, 2021**

Residual carrying amount goodwill — 575.3

During the second quarter of 2022, the WACC deteriorated as a consequence of a significant increase in the risk-free base
rate and the cost of debt. The Group WACC after tax increased significantly from 6.67% as applied in the regular impairment
test for 2021 to 8.28% as of June 30, 2022. Despite a continuing positive business outlook, the significant increase in the
interest rate as of June 30, 2022 is considered a triggering event and hence, an impairment test was performed.

As part of the triggering event impairment test for capitalized goodwill as of June 30, 2022, the expected cash outflow was
determined based on the discounted cash flow method using the following defined parameters:

**in %**

Growth rate for terminal value 1.2

Pre tax WACC 2022 10.4

F-12


-----

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements for the First 6 Months of 2022  |  Notes

In the previous year, the parameters that were applied as of November 30, 2021 were as follows:

**in %**

Growth rate for terminal value 1.2

Pre tax WACC 2021 8.3

The discounted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use of the cash-generating units, applying an individual
interest rate for the cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three years. Such a detailed planning period reflects
the assumptions of short to medium-term market developments. For the period after this three-year detailed planning horizon,
a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of 50% of the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. The detailed
planning period for determining values in use is based on certain assumptions that are based on past experience, complemented
by internal developments, and verified based on external market data and analyses. Key assumptions include the development
of future selling prices or quantities, costs, the influence of the regulatory market environment, investments, market share,
foreign exchange rates, and growth rates. Only temporary influences are expected from the Covid-19 pandemic, which will be
offset within a year, which is why no discount has been planned. The interest rate calculated on the cash-generating units
includes the market parameters influenced by the Covid-19 pandemic accordingly. Furthermore, the expected cash flow scenario
analysis for Russia has been implemented in the three year planning period. Significant changes to the aforementioned assumptions would influence the determination of the values in use of the cash-generating units. The discount rates used are determined based on external factors derived from the market and are adjusted for the risks predominant in the cash- generating
units in question, despite the aforementioned change in assumption for the discount rates in Russia. Furthermore, an increased
country risk premium is applied for Ukraine as a consequence of the Russian invasion.

An impairment of € 575.0 million, which was the full amount of the goodwill, has been recognized.

Additionally, impairments occurred for intangible assets other than goodwill amounting to € 48.1 million. The interest rates
applied in the impairment test leading to an impairment were between 8.3% and 26.8%. The value in use, which is similar to
its fair market value, was the basis used for the impairment testing.

The umbrella brand Nizhpharm with a carrying amount of € 14.7 million (December 31, 2021: € 9.9 million) as of June 30,
2022, will be amortized as scheduled over its useful life. Due to the exchange rate development of the Russian ruble, the
carrying amount in the current half year increased, despite the scheduled depreciation. As a consequence of the Russian
invasion of Ukraine, an impairment test for the umbrella brand was performed by applying the expected cash flow method
utilizing the Russia scenario analysis. In the context of the impairment test of June 30, 2022, an unchanged royalty rate of 2%
and a discount rate of 8.8% (December 31, 2021: 8.8%) were used. There was no necessity for impairment in the interim
period.

The interest rate developments may continue and could lead to a further increase in the WACC and have a potential impact
on the valuation of intangible assets.

**3.2. Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment amounted to € 646.1 million as of June 30, 2022 (December 31, 2021: € 624.9 million).

For the tangible assets the relevant CGU for Russia was subject to an impairment test using the expected cash flow scenario
assumptions described in Note 1.3. There was no necessity for impairment in the interim period.

F-13


-----

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements for the First 6 Months of 2022  |  Notes

Impairments were recorded in relation to tangible assets in Ukraine due to negative future prospects arising from the Russian
invasion of Ukraine and the associated increase of market risk premium leading to a significant increase of the WACC. As a
consequence, all tangible assets of the CGU Ukraine, mainly consisting of machinery and equipment, have been impaired
(€ 17.3 million).

In addition, investments are continuously made in the Group’s own manufacturing facilities and test laboratories. In the
reporting period, investments in the expansion and modernization of production facilities, manufacturing plants and test
laboratories amounted to € 15.5 million (1-6/2021: € 15.9 million). This included € 0.9 million for the expansion of a production network in Romania. A total of around € 12 million has been invested in the new production network located in Turda,
Romania since the beginning of the expansion project.

**3.3. Financial assets**

Financial assets were at € 10.6 million as of June 30, 2022 (December 31, 2021: € 18.1 million).

**3.4. Investments measured at equity**

Investments measured at equity amounted to € 2.9 million as of June 30, 2022 (December 31, 2021: € 2.9 million).

**3.5. Inventories**

Inventories increased to € 918.6 million as of June 30, 2022 (December 31, 2021: € 812.1 million). This development was
driven by foreign exchange translation effects due to the appreciation of the Russian ruble as well as an inventory build up as
of the balance sheet date.

**3.6. Trade accounts receivable**

Trade accounts receivable increased to € 899.1 million as of June 30, 2022 (December 31, 2021: € 763.5 million), which was
also significantly influenced by foreign exchange translation effects due to the appreciation of the Russian ruble.

**3.7. Income tax receivables**

Income tax receivables were € 45.9 million as of June 30, 2022 (December 31, 2021: € 38.3 million).

**3.8 Other financial assets**

Other financial assets amounted to € 23.4 million as of June 30, 2022 (December 31, 2021: € 16.3 million) including current
and non-current positions.

**3.9. Retained earnings and other reserves**

Retained earnings including net income comprise the net income of the first 6 months of 2022 and the results achieved in
previous periods, insofar as they have not been distributed. Revaluations of obligations from defined pension benefit plans,
recognized through other comprehensive income net of tax, are also shown in this position.

Other reserves include results directly considered in equity. This relates mainly to the currency translation reserve. The significant increase in currency translation reserve as of June 30, 2022 was attributable in particular to the strong appreciation

F-14

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements for the First 6 Months of 2022  |  Notes

of the Russian ruble since December 31, 2021 and to the resulting gain recognized in equity from currency translation for
companies that report in this currency.

**3.10. Financial liabilities**

The Group’s current and non-current financial liabilities amounted to € 422.9 million and € 5,427.6 million as of June 30, 2022
(December 31, 2021: € 334.8 million and € 5,684.3 million, respectively).

In order to finance the takeover of STADA Arzneimittel AG in 2017, the Nidda Group had initially made use of the equity
commitments made available by the sponsors, a syndicated loan agreement and two bridge loans. The syndicated loan agreement provided for a secured loan in several tranches and currencies, with an original total nominal amount of up to
€ 1,700.0 million and a secured revolving credit facility of up to € 400.0 million (“RCF”). As of June 30, 2022, non- current
liabilities under the term loan (as amended and restated) amounted to a nominal value of € 3,028.2 million (December 31,
2021: € 3,036.1 million). As of June 30, 2022, the RCF was not drawn.

The bridge loans were refinanced as planned through long-term bonds consisting of: (a) € 735.0 million (in aggregate principal
amount) of 3.5% senior secured notes due September 30, 2024, issued by Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH and (b) € 340.0 million (in aggregate principal amount) of 5% senior notes due September 30, 2025, issued by Nidda BondCo GmbH.

In order to finance the shares of STADA Arzneimittel AG tendered as part of the de-listing tender offer made in October 2018,
the Nidda Group utilized existing liquid funds, existing facilities under the syndicated loan agreement, an additional facility
under the syndicated loan agreement with a total nominal amount of € 705.0 million and a bridge loan with a nominal amount
of € 250.0 million. The bridge loan was refinanced by Nidda BondCo GmbH on December 4, 2018 and December 13, 2018 by
the issuance of senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of € 250.0 million, an interest rate of 7.25% p.a and a maturity
date of September 30, 2025. In the second quarter of 2022, senior notes of an aggregate principal amount of € 10.8 million
were repurchased.

To finance the acquisition of Takeda’s OTC portfolio in Russia/CIS, Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH issued temporary notes
with an aggregate principal amount of € 600.0 million and an interest rate of 3.5% p.a. in the fourth quarter of 2019. The
acquisition of Takeda’s product portfolio was completed on March 3, 2020 and, at the same time, the temporary notes were
exchanged for an equivalent amount of additional senior secured notes with an interest rate of 3.5% p.a. and a maturity date
of September 30, 2024.

In addition, in February 2020, Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH issued senior secured notes with an aggregate principal amount
of € 350.0 million, an interest rate of 3.5% p.a. and a maturity date of September 30, 2024, the proceeds of which were used
to finance the acquisition of consumer healthcare brands from GlaxoSmithKline in the second quarter of 2020.

Furthermore, under the syndicated loan agreement, Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH obtained an additional credit facility
with a total nominal amount of € 260.0 million, which was fully utilized in March 2020 to finance the acquisition of Czech
pharmaceutical company Walmark.

In May 2020, Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH also issued senior secured notes with an aggregate principal amount of
€ 200 million, an interest rate of 3.5% and a maturity date on September 30, 2024 for general corporate purposes.

In September 2021, Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH announced a € 350 million-equivalent increase in the commitments for
Facility F under its existing senior credit facility agreement. The proceeds of the Facility F Increase were partly used to repay
STADA Arzneimittel AG’s senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of € 267.3 million due April 8, 2022.

In addition to the financing instruments existing at the level of the Nidda Holding companies, as of June 30, 2022, STADA had
promissory note loans with a total nominal amount of € 7.0 million (December 31, 2021: € 7.0 million) and further bank loans
with a nominal value of € 416.8 million (December 31, 2021: € 304.8 million). The increase in bank loans was mainly relating
to translation effects due to the strong appreciation of the Russian ruble versus December 31, 2021.

**3.11. Trade accounts payable**

Trade accounts payable increased to € 638.5 million as of June 30, 2022 (December 31, 2021: € 594.2 million). This development was also driven by foreign exchange translation effects due to the appreciation of the Russian ruble as of balance sheet
date and in part also a result of the stock build up.

**3.12. Deferred tax liabilities**

Deferred tax liabilities increased to € 966.8 million as of June 30, 2022 (December 31, 2021: € 924.4 million). This development
was particularly impacted by the application of the expected average annual tax ratio for the full financial year 2022 on the
pre-tax result for the first 6 months in 2022.

**3.13. Income tax liabilities**

Income tax liabilities amounted to € 58.6 million as of June 30, 2022 (December 31, 2021: € 64.3 million).

**3.14. Other financial liabilities**

Other financial liabilities increased to € 389.0 million as of June 30, 2022 (December 31, 2021: € 377.4 million) including
current and non-current positions.

**3.15. Other liabilities**

Other liabilities totaled € 180.4 million as of June 30, 2022 (December 31, 2021: € 161.6 million) including current and noncurrent positions. The increase in other liabilities was mainly driven by higher VAT liabilities.

##### 4. Information on the Cash Flow Statement

**4.1. Operating Cash Flow**

Operating cash flow, which comprises positions not covered by investments, financing, changes in cash and cash equivalents
due to exchange rate fluctuations as well as changes due to the scope of consolidation and evaluation, amounted to € 298.5 million in the first 6 months of 2022 (1-6/2021: € 180.1 million). This development was primarily based on an increase in EBITDA
adjusted for material non-cash effects and thus the gross cash flow in connection with an active operational liquidity management, especially regarding working capital. In addition, there were considerably lower payments for health insurance discounts
in Germany compared to the respective previous period.

**4.2. Investing Cash Flow**

Investing cash flow, which comprises cash outflows for investments less proceeds from disposals, was -€ 96.5 million in the
first 6 months of the current financial year (1-6/2021: -€ 71.1 million). Investing cash flow in the reporting period was mainly
influenced by investments in intangible assets. In the reporting period, a total of € 51.1 million (1-6/2021: € 30.7 million) was
spent for acquisitions including previous business combinations in accordance with IFRS 3 (including VAT) and significant
investments in intangible assets for the expansion of the product portfolio.

**4.3. Financing Cash Flow**

Financing cash flow in the first 6 months of the current financial year amounted to -€ 483.5 million (1-6/2021: -€ 203.6 million) and resulted mainly from settlements of financial liabilities including the scheduled repayment of the STADA Bond as
well as interest payments. In addition, there were payments from changes in non-controlling interests relating to the final
earn-out payments in connection with further share acquisitions in the Vietnamese subsidiary Pymepharco made in financial
year 2020.

**4.4. Cash flow of the current period**

Cash flow was -€ 253.6 million in the first 6 months of 2022 (1-6/2021: -€ 90.5 million), as a net figure of all cash inflows and
outflows from the operating cash flow, investing cash flow and financing cash flow, in addition to changes in financial resources
due to the foreign exchange rate and/or scope of consolidation.

Financial assets recognized at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) include factorable receivables. These
financial assets, which are still included in trade accounts receivable, are recognized at fair value through other comprehensive
income and are therefore included in the table above. Changes in the fair value of these receivables – which differs from the
measurement at amortized cost to only a minor extent – are recognized through other comprehensive income in the FVOCI
reserve. This category also includes the shares acquired from the Swedish company XBrane. Due to the company’s shares being
admitted to trading on a stock exchange, they have been classified in Stage 1.

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements for the First 6 Months of 2022  |  Notes

In preparing the interim financial statements, assignment to the respective hierarchy levels is verified based on the information
available on the determination of the fair values. If a need for reclassification is found here, the reclassification takes place at
the start of the reporting period.

The fair values are analyzed when preparing the financial statements. For this purpose, market comparisons and change
analyses are carried out.

Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) include positive and negative
market values of derivative financial instruments which are not in a hedging relationship. The fair values of currency forwards
were determined in the Group’s own system according to standardized procedures and using customary financial mathematical
methods based on current data such as spot prices and swap rates provided by a recognized information service. The fair value
for the interest rate cap instrument was determined using appropriate valuation models by external third parties.

In the Group, currency forwards are designated as fair value hedges that are concluded to hedge the currency from intercompany loans with companies that conduct their accounting in a local currency other than euro. Changes in the value of the
underlying currency – which result from changes in the respective currency exchange rates – are offset by the changes in value
of the currency forwards. The purpose of the fair value hedges is therefore to hedge the currency risk of these intercompany
loans. Credit risks are not reflected in the hedge. The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is reviewed both prospectively
and retrospectively on each closing date. As of the closing date, all designated hedging relationships were sufficiently effective.

For financial assets and liabilities whose fair value deviates from the carrying amount, the following disclosures are made:

The financial liabilities presented in the table are assigned to the measurement category “Financial liabilities measured at
amortized cost” pursuant to IFRS 9.

For all other financial assets and liabilities except those shown in the table above, the carrying amount – approximately or
based on measurement methods by taking listed prices on active markets or input parameters observable on the market as a
basis – corresponds to the relevant fair value of the individual financial assets and liabilities.

##### 6. Contingent liabilities and other financial obligations

Contingent liabilities describe possible obligations with respect to third parties which result from past events and which may
lead to a future outflow of resources depending on specific events. As of June 30, 2022, these contingent liabilities were
considered not probable and are therefore not accounted for.

Compared with contingent liabilities of € 30.7 million at the end of 2021, significant potential obligations increased by
€ 18.3 million in the first 6 months of 2022 to € 49.0 million as of June 30, 2022. This development was mainly due to additional potential obligations from patent risks for active pharmaceutical ingredients.

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements for the First 6 Months of 2022  |  Notes

In addition to the contingent liabilities, there are also other future financial obligations composed of the following:

in k € **June 30, 2022** **Dec. 31, 2021**

Obligations from leases 44,265 5,176

Other financial obligations 120,143 120,063

**Total** **164,407** **125,239**

The information on future obligations from leases includes obligations from short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.
The increase in obligations from leases versus December 31, 2021 mainly relates to lease contracts which have been assessed
and determined not to qualify as right-of use assets (e.g. cloud applications).

Long-term obligations for logistics and accounting services are reported within other financial obligations. Bona fide contingent
liabilities and further guarantees assumed by the Group are also included within other financial obligations.

##### 7. Related party transactions

In the scope of the ordinary course of business, Nidda German Topco GmbH and/or its consolidated companies have entered
into related party transactions. In accordance with IAS 24, “Related Parties” refers to directly or indirectly controlled subsidiaries that are not consolidated due to lack of material significance, associates and joint ventures as well as persons in key
positions and their close relatives. In principle, all trades were settled with related companies and natural persons at market-rate
conditions.

As of June 30, 2022, as was the case in the previous year, there were no outstanding liabilities to members of STADAs
Executive Board in office during the financial year arising from severance payments. There were outstanding liabilities to
members of the Executive Board in office in the financial year from bonuses of € 1.5 million (December 31, 2021: € 2.2 million).

**Share-based remuneration in the form of a share purchase plan**

The main shareholders of Nidda German Topco GmbH’s most senior parent company, Nidda Topco S.à r.l., Luxembourg, have
offered a share purchase plan to selected managers of the Group, including all members of STADA’s Executive Board and some
members of its Supervisory Board (managers in key positions). Pursuant to the conditions of the offer, the managers in question are authorized to acquire a stake in a German limited partnership (GmbH & Co KG). The limited partnership stake in the
partnership amounts to € 7.3 million and is held by managers in key positions (28%), other managers (54%) and the main
shareholders of Nidda Topco S.à r.l., Luxembourg, as well as third parties (18%). Accordingly, the partnership holds 8.0% of
ordinary shares issued of Nidda Topco S.à r.l., Luxembourg.

The purchase price of the limited partnership stake in the GmbH & Co KG is determined on each acquisition date on the basis
of the fair value of the ordinary shares of Nidda Topco S.à r.l., Luxembourg, and the additional special features of the program.
The fair value of the ordinary shares of Nidda Topco S.à r.l., Luxembourg, is determined on the basis of the discounted cash
flow valuation taking into account the expected cash flow from the investment in STADA as well as for the financing instruments issued by the Nidda Group companies. The purchase price calculation is considered to be the fair value of the limited
partnership stake in the GmbH & Co KG, but not as the granting of additional remuneration for the management. In the event
of continued employment by the company, the management will participate in the change in the fair value of the ordinary
shares of Nidda Topco S.à r.l., Luxembourg, through this investment by ultimately selling the shares together with the other
shareholders of Nidda Topco S.à r.l., Luxembourg.

Neither Nidda Topco S.à r.l., Luxembourg, nor Nidda German Topco GmbH or any other Group company is obligated to pay
any amount to the management under this program. In accordance with IFRS 2, the program is treated as a share-based
remuneration plan that does not grant any or no significant additional remuneration to managers.

The structure of the consolidated income statement follows the cost-of-sales method, according to which expenses incurred
in generating sales are divided into functional areas. In the statement of comprehensive income, use was made of the option
to present this separately from the consolidated income statement. The balance sheet classification distinguishes between
non-current and current assets and liabilities, some of which are presented in detail in the notes according to their current or
non-current distinction.

The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in euro. Unless otherwise indicated, figures in the Notes are shown in
euro thousands (k €). Rounding is thus necessary, although this of course is not significant in its nature.

**3. Consequences of new or amended standards and interpretations**

The pronouncements published by the IASB and adopted by the EU or amendments to pronouncements of the IASB with a
first-time application date of January 1, 2021 have been observed by Nidda in financial year 2021 and applied where relevant.

The Group has applied the reform of the reference interest rates – phase 2 for the first time. These provide practical relief from
certain requirements of IFRS standards and relate to changes in financial contracts and leases or hedging relationships triggered
by the replacement of a reference interest rate in a contract with a new alternative reference rate. Changes in the basis for
determining contractual cash flows resulting from the reference rate reform “phase 2” of the reference rate reform requires,
for financial instruments classified as at amortized cost, that changes in the basis for determining contractual cash flows
resulting from the reference rate reform lead to an adjustment of their effective interest rates.

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements 2021  |  Notes

As of December 31, 2021, NIDDA Healthcare Holding had loan liabilities of GBP 316 million for which the change in reference
interest rates has already taken place. There are no other financial liabilities or financial assets that are affected by the reference
interest rate reform. Nidda has credit lines of € 400 million available, which can be drawn in GBP, among other currencies, and
for which the change in reference interest rates has already been contractually agreed. These credit lines had not been drawn
at the reporting date of December 31, 2021.

The IASB has published the following IFRS standards that were not yet applied:

From today’s perspective, no or no significant effects on the Consolidated Financial Statements are expected from the future
application of the further standards (IFRS 1, IFRS 3,IFRS 9, IFRS 16, IAS 16, IAS 36, IAS 37, IAS 41) and interpretations not yet
applied.

**4. Changes in accounting policies**

There were no changes to accounting policies with significant consequences for the presentation of net assets, financial
position and results of operations or cash flows in financial year 2021.

**5. Scope of consolidation**

All significant subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Subsidiaries
are companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by Nidda German Topco GmbH and are therefore fully consolidated.
Control exists if Nidda German Topco GmbH or its subsidiaries are in control of an investee, are exposed to variable backflows
and, due to control over existing rights, are able to substantially influence the investee’s variable backflows. Control is usually
substantiated by a share of voting rights of more than 50%.

Joint arrangements are characterized by joint control by two or more parties and should be classified as either joint operations
or as joint ventures. In joint operations, the parties that exercise joint control possess the rights to assets and liabilities included
in the agreement. In joint ventures, however, the parties involved possess rights to the company’s net assets. Joint ventures
are to be included in the Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method.

Associates are companies over which Nidda German Topco GmbH can have significant direct or indirect influence and are not
subsidiaries or joint ventures. They are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method.

Subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates whose influence, both individually and as a whole, on the net assets, financial
position and results of operations of the Nidda Group is insignificant, are not consolidated or accounted for using the equity
method. Investments in these companies are accounted for at amortized cost under financial assets. Accumulated, the sales
and balance sheet total of these companies make up less than 1% of total Group sales and/or the balance sheet total.

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements 2021  |  Notes

**6. Principles for the consolidation of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates**

According to IFRS, business combinations are to be accounted for using the acquisition method. Assets, liabilities and
con tingent liabilities from business combinations are generally recognized in full – irrespective of the amount of the shareholding – as of the acquisition date at their fair values. If the historical costs of the subsidiary acquired exceed the proportionate
newly measured net assets of the acquiree, Nidda recognizes the positive difference as goodwill. After critical examination of
the premises underlying the purchase price allocation, a negative difference is recognized through profit or loss in the period
of the acquisition. In a business combination achieved in stages, it is necessary to carry out a revaluation through profit or loss
of the shares previously held at the date control was achieved. The shares of non-controlling interests are disclosed in the
amount of their share in net assets of the subsidiary.

The acquisition of additional shares from an existing controlling position in a subsidiary is recognized through other comprehensive income in accordance with IFRS 10, because it is a transaction between the equity investors.

Subsidiaries are generally included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the acquisition date to the end of control
by the parent company. Receivables, liabilities, expenses, income and earnings between the companies included in the
Consolidated Financial Statements are eliminated, intercompany value adjustments and provisions are reversed. If these
consolidation measures result in deviations between the IFRS carrying amounts and the tax base of assets and liabilities,
deferred tax liabilities are recognized.

Shares in associates are recognized according to the equity method at acquisition cost on the date when joint control is established (joint ventures) or when significant influence was established (associates) and carried forward from this date in the
amount of the proportionate share of earnings in the financial year. A positive difference determined during the purchase price
allocation is recognized as goodwill in the carrying amount of the investment in the associate. A negative difference is recognized in income in the period of the acquisition in the results from associates. Profit and loss from transactions with associates
is recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements only according to the share of minority interests.

If indications arise from the application of IFRS 9 that the carrying amount determined using the equity method might be
impaired, an impairment test is carried out and, if applicable, an impairment loss in the amount of the difference between the
carrying amount and the recoverable amount is recognized. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less cost to
sell and the value in use of the shares in an associate.

**7. Currency translation**

The functional currency of Nidda German Topco GmbH is the euro and corresponds to the reporting currency of the Group.

In the separate financial statements of companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate applicable at the time of the transactions. On every
balance sheet date, monetary items are translated using the closing rate. Resulting currency translation differences are recognized in income as exchange gains or losses. Non-monetary items are translated using the transaction rate.

F-39


-----

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements 2021  |  Notes

The translation of the companies with a functional currency other than the euro included in the Consolidated Financial
Statements into the Group functional currency is carried out using the closing rate method. Assets and liabilities are generally
translated using the closing rate, while individual components of equity are translated using the historical rates at
their respective dates of inflow from the Group’s perspective. The income and expenses of the income statements are translated – and thereby also the resulting translation of the annual results to be entered in equity – using the average exchange
rate of the period.

Currency translation differences arising from the use of different exchange rates are recognized directly in equity in the
“Provisions for currency translation”. These provisions are reversed and recognized in income if Group companies leave the
scope of consolidation.

The exchange rate development of currencies important to Nidda to the euro can be seen in the following chart:

**Closing rate Dec. 31 in local currency** **Average rate for the reporting period**

**Significant currency relations**
**in the national currency to 1 euro** **2021** **2020** **±** **2021** **2020** **±**

Pound sterling 0.8403 0.8990 +7% 0.8600 0.8892 +3%

Russian ruble 85.3004 91.4617 +7% 87.2321 82.6454 -6%

Serbian dinar 117.5821 117.5802 0% 117.5735 117.5776 0%

Swiss franc 1.0331 1.0802 +4% 1.0814 1.0703 -1%

Ukrainian hryvnia 30.9219 34.7689 +11% 32.2959 30.8127 -5%

US dollar 1.1326 1.2271 +8% 1.1835 1.1413 -4%

In terms of percentage changes compared with the previous year, a depreciation of the respective national currency is shown
in the table with a minus sign, while an appreciation is shown with a plus sign.

**8. Business combinations**

In the third quarter of 2021, STADA acquired US-based Friska LLC. This is a company that sells branded products in the areas
of vitamins, minerals and dietary supplements. A payment in the mid single-digit million euro range was made to the seller as
the base purchase price. This will increase if certain purchase price conditions are met. The final purchase price allocation for
this business combination resulted in goodwill of € 6.3 million, mainly from the acquired sales structures and the associated
sales expertise.

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements 2021  |  Notes

The following balance sheet figures at the acquisition date were applied as final figures for the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in the context of business combinations:

**August 2, 2021**
**Fair values in € million** **(fair value)**

Intangible assets 0.3

Trade receivables 0.2

Other assets 0.1

**Assets** **1.2**

Other liabilities 2.0

**Liabilities** **2.0**

**9. Accounting policies**

Nidda’s Consolidated Financial Statements are based on uniform accounting policies. The basis for these are the accounting
requirements which are mandatory for all companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements and which are described
in more detail below insofar as they are significant for the Consolidated Financial Statements or for which option rights are
exercised.

**Sales are recognized when the control over delimitable goods passes to the customer, meaning that the customer is able to**
determine the use of the delimitable goods and, essentially, derive benefit from them. As a requirement for this, there must
be an agreement with enforceable rights and obligations and, inter alia, a consideration must be highly likely. The creditworthiness of the customer must be considered in this instance. The amount of sales is based on the transaction price to which
the Group is expected to be entitled. Variable considerations that are only considered if it is highly likely that this will not lead
to a significant reversal of sales should there no longer be any uncertainty regarding the variable consideration, have an
influence on the expected transaction price. The amount of the variable consideration is therefore determined using the
expected value method.

Expenses from the creation of provisions for returns are deducted from sales on the basis of estimated amounts. The estimates
are based on experience regarding amounts used in the past. The estimated expense from the creation of provisions is determined as a percentage of sales. Discounts to health insurance organizations are also recognized with a reduction on sales
based on the respective contract in force.

All license agreements are either bound to the realized sales of the licensee or further activities are necessary on the part of
STADA that would allow the use of the right by the licensee. The realization of sales is thus distributed over the periods of the
contractual term.

Income and expenses from the same transactions are generally recognized in the same period. Expenses related to accruals
for future revenue reductions are thus recorded in the period in which the sales are realized.

**Cost of sales includes the costs of conversion of the products sold and the purchase price of commercial goods sold or given**
free of charge. The expense is recognized in the period in which the associated income is realized. In addition, cost of sales
also includes costs directly attributable to the commercial goods (e.g. cost of materials and personnel expenses), overhead
costs (e.g. scheduled depreciation of production equipment and regulatory drug approvals and licenses) as well as value
adjustments of excess or obsolete inventories.

**Development costs consist of expenses involved initially in the technical implementation of theoretical discoveries in**
production and production processes and ultimately their commercial implementation.

As a rule, the objective of a development process is to obtain national or multinational regulatory drug approval. Downstream
from the development process is an evaluation process at the end of which a decision on the actual execution of a development
is made. Within the development process itself, development costs relative to approvals for new drugs result in capitalization
as intangible assets if all the following preconditions are met:

- It is technically possible to complete the asset (generally, achieve regulatory approval), enabling it to become available for
use or sale.

- The intention and ability, as well as the necessary resources, exist to complete the asset and to use (i.e. usually to market
it oneself) or sell it in the future.

- The intangible asset provides the Group with a future economic benefit.

- It is possible to reliably calculate the development costs of the intangible asset.

Development costs not eligible for capitalization as expense are immediately recognized in the periods in which they are
incurred. These include expenses for technical and regulatory maintenance of products marketed.

**Goodwill is not amortized over the period of useful life. Instead, an impairment test is performed at least once per year**
(impairment-only approach). Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units. The STADA Group is managed as a cash-generating
unit in the Nidda Group. For this reason, the impairment test of goodwill is carried out at this levell.

Nidda plans to carry out impairment tests for capitalized goodwill at least once a year. Additional reviews also take place if
indications of impairment become apparent. During the impairment test, the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit
is compared with its recoverable amount. The carrying amount of a cash-generating unit comprises the carrying amounts of
all assets and liabilities attributable to the valuation unit including the carrying amount of goodwill to be tested. If the
recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is lower than the carrying amount, an impairment loss results. The recoverable
amount is generally defined as the higher of the fair value less costs to sell, if measurable, and the value in use of the cashgenerating unit. The discounted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use, applying an individual interest rate
for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three years. For the period after this three-year detailed
planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of 50% the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed.
Significant assumptions made in order to determine the value in use include assumptions regarding sales development, regulatory conditions, investments, the discount rate, currency relations as well as the growth rate. These assumptions are made
individually according to the individual situations for every cash-generating unit and are partly based on internally determined
assumptions that both reflect past experience and include external market data.

**Other intangible assets with determinable useful lives are recognized at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over the**
period of their useful life. Amortization shall begin when the asset is available for use, i.e. when it is in the condition necessary
for it to be capable of operating in the intended manner. The useful life of regulatory drug approvals, trademarks, licenses,
dossiers with data for drug approvals or in preparation of drug approvals, software, concessions, property rights and similar
rights is between three and 30 years. Expenses from scheduled amortization of intangible assets are allocated to the relevant
functional costs and generally reported within cost of sales. If on the reporting date, there are indications that these assets
are impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is re-evaluated and impairment losses are recognized according to the
difference to the carrying amount. If the reasons for recognizing an impairment loss cease to exist, corresponding write-ups
are carried out up to a maximum of the amortized cost, insofar as the estimates for the calculation of the recoverable amount
of the asset justifies this.

Intangible assets with indeterminable useful lives are not amortized. In the context of annual impairment tests and additionally in all cases where there are indications of impairment, the recoverable amounts of these assets are compared with their
carrying amounts and if necessary, an impairment loss is recognized. For this purpose, the fair value of the asset less costs to
sell was determined using the relief from royalty method. At Nidda, this affects the capitalized umbrella brands STADA, Hemofarm and Pymepharco. Impairment tests are carried out for the umbrella brands with indefinite useful lives at the level of the
individual company or, for the umbrella brand Hemofarm, at the level of the individual companies that generate sales under
the Hemofarm umbrella brand. Intangible assets that are not yet available for use are also generally put through annual
impairment tests. Furthermore, in each reporting period, an audit is carried out to check whether the reasons for recognizing
an indefinite useful life continue to exist.

Internal development costs are capitalized in accordance with the criteria in IAS 38. Capitalized development costs consist
mainly of costs that can be allocated to the projects, such as the costs of individuals working in development, material costs,
external services and directly allocable overhead costs. Internally created intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line
basis over their useful life (generally 20 years).

**Property, plant and equipment is reported at cost less depreciation and any impairment losses plus write-ups. Depreciation**
shall begin when the asset is available for use and is accordingly in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating.
Subsequent acquisition costs are capitalized. Capitalization requires that a future economic benefit will flow to the company
and that the cost of the asset can be reliably measured. Expenses for repairs and maintenance that do not represent significant
replacement investments are recognized as expenses in the financial year in which they are incurred.

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated according to their useful life using the straight-line method. The
depreciation period may be up to 50 years in the case of buildings, eight to 20 years in the case of technical facilities and four
to ten years for other plant and office furniture and equipment. The component approach, according to which every significant
component of property, plant and equipment with different useful lives, must be depreciated separately, is not applied due to
a lack of relevance. To the extent necessary, impairment losses are recognized pursuant to IAS 36; these are reversed if the
reasons for the original recognition of an impairment loss no longer exist insofar as the estimates for the calculation of the
recoverable amount of the asset justifies this.

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or production of a qualifying asset are capitalized as part of
the cost of the intangible asset or property, plant and equipment. Other borrowing costs are not capitalized. Where acquisitions
are made in a currency other than the respective functional currency, subsequent changes in exchange rates have no impact
on the recording of original historical costs.

**Impairments on other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment exist when the recoverable amount of an asset**
is lower that its carrying amount. At each reporting date, Nidda assesses whether indications for impairment are apparent. If
this is the case, e.g. if certain defined critical values are exceeded, the asset’s recoverable amount is determined. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, where the value in use is calculated
with a discounted cash flow method. Under this procedure, future cash flows from intangible assets are discounted at the
weighted average cost of capital. Expenses arising from impairments are recognized under “Other expenses”.

For the purpose of impairment tests of other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, cash-generating units are
defined at the level of individual assets within the areas of Generics, Consumer Healthcare and Specialty.

If the reasons for an impairment no longer exist, the corresponding write-ups are carried out up to a maximum of the carrying
amounts determined at amortized cost. Income from write-ups is reported under the item “Other income”.

**Inventories include such assets that are held for sale in the ordinary course of business (finished goods), that are in the process**
of production for such sale (work in progress), and that are consumed in the production process or in the rendering of services
(materials and supplies). Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Historical costs or costs of
sales are determined based on weighted average costs. Costs of sales include both costs that are directly incurred in production
and overheads that can be allocated to the production process, including reasonable depreciation on production facilities.
Financing costs are not included, but are instead recognized as an expense in the period in which they occur. Net realizable
value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated
costs necessary to make the sale.

**Financial assets can be divided into the following categories in accordance with IFRS 9: Measurement at amortised cost (“AC”),**
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (“FVPL”) and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive
income (“FVOCI”). Financial assets are accounted for and measured in accordance with IFRS 9. This involves classifying a
financial asset on the basis of its contractual cash flow characteristics and business model. Under IFRS 9, a financial asset is
carried at cost if the underlying business model is to hold the assets in order to collect contractual cash flows (business model
condition). In addition, the cash flow condition must be satisfied. This is the case when the contractual features of the financial
asset at specified times only provide for interest and principal payments on the outstanding principal amount.

Receivables eligible for factoring are included in trade accounts receivable. Based on the present business model, they are
measured at fair value recorded directly in equity. Changes in the fair value of these receivables are therefore recognized
directly in equity in the FVOCI reserve. Financial assets measured at fair value recorded directly in equity are generally subject
to the same impairment model as financial assets measured at amortized cost.

In accordance with IFRS 9, expected losses are accounted for on the basis of the expected credit loss model. The simplified
approach is applied for trade accounts receivable. The general approach is generally applied to other financial assets.

**Trade accounts receivable are measured at amortized cost less impairments using the effective interest rate method. Impair-**
ments are made in the form of individual impairments and general individual impairments for specific defaults and expected
default risks resulting from the insolvency of customers. To quantify the expected default risk, the expected future cash flows
from receivables grouped by debtor are determined. To this end, the maturity structures of net receivables and experience
relating to derecognition of receivables in the past, the creditworthiness of the customers as well as changes in payment
conditions are taken into account. In addition, a trade credit insurance that covers part of the loss in case of default is to be
taken into consideration for various Group companies. The required impairment determined reduces the assets’ carrying
amounts through recognition of an impairment account.

The loss is recognized in profit and loss under “Other expenses”. Bad debts are derecognized against the impairment account.
Subsequent cash receipts for receivables already derecognized are presented net of expenses.

**Financial liabilities are measured on initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the**
acquisition. For financial liabilities that subsequently continue to be measured at fair value, any transaction costs are recognized
as an expense in the period in which they occur. This relates to the accounting of derivative financial instruments with negative
market values. These financial liabilities are reported in the “Other financial liabilities” item.

F-44

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements 2021  |  Notes

Fair value hedges serve to hedge against the risk of market value fluctuations. The results from the hedging instruments
are generally recognized in the items of the income statement in which the fair value change of the hedged underlying transaction is also reflected. Within the scope of fair value hedge accounting, in addition to the fair value change in the derivative,
the opposing fair value change in the underlying transaction is recognized in profit or loss, insofar as it is attributable to the
hedged risk.

No use is made of the option to designate financial liabilities on initial recognition as financial liabilities to be recognized at
fair value through profit or loss.

**Leases in which the Group is the lessee are recognized as rights of use within non-current assets and as corresponding lease**
liabilities within other financial liabilities. Excepted from this are short-term leases with a maximum term of 12 months as well
as leases for low-value assets with a value of below € 5,000. Here, Nidda applies the option to recognize such leases as expenses
at the time of the lease payment. Upon initial recognition, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the outstanding lease payments, discounted at the interest rate underlying the lease. If the interest rate underlying the lease cannot be
determined, a marginal debt rate is used. Nidda also makes use of the lease provision not to separate non-lease components
from lease components and recognizes corresponding leases as a single agreement.

**10. Estimates, assumptions and discretion in the application of accounting principles**

The presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements is
determined by recognition and valuation methods. To a certain extent, Nidda makes estimates and assumptions relating to
the future that are based on past experience as well as other factors that are considered to be appropriate in the particular
circumstances. Although the estimates and assumptions are constantly re-evaluated, estimates derived in this way may differ
from actual circumstances. The significant estimates, accounting judgments and related assumptions for the accounting issues
concerned are detailed below.

Nidda expects that the Covid-19 situation prevalent at the time of the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements
will only have a temporary impact on business development in 2022, due, for example, to postponed doctor or hospital visits
in the first quarter or a lower incidence of infectious diseases due to hygiene measures. In all probability, however, it cannot
be assumed that there will be any further long-lasting severe restrictions in 2022 (e.g. lockdowns lasting several weeks with
school closures, etc.), meaning that the temporary impact will in all likelihood be offset again within the year. In any case, no
lasting and significant adverse effect on the development of sales or earnings is expected that would have an impact on the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Impact due to Covid-19 on the Consolidated Financial Statements, however, could occur
for the following reasons: Interest rate adjustments in various countries, increased volatility in foreign currency exchange
rates, deteriorating credit ratings, payment defaults or delays, delays in order entry and execution or modified cost structures,
limited asset utilization, volatility in the financial and commodity markets, limited or no access to customer facilities, or difficulty in making forecasts and projections due to uncertainties in the volume and timing of cash flows. These factors may affect
the fair values and carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, the amount and timing of earnings recognition as well as cash
flows. It is reasonably possible that adjustments to assumptions and carrying amounts may be necessary in financial year 2022.
Nidda assumes at the present time that the assumptions made adequately reflect the situation at the time of preparation of
the consolidated financial statements.

Furthermore, climate-related risks can affect estimates and assumptions when applying accounting policies. For example,
climate protection requirements can have an influence on cost structures in the area of production or the purchase of products
and/or raw materials and supplies. However, STADA assumes that climate-related risks have been adequately taken into account
in Nidda’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements 2021  |  Notes

The significant estimates, accounting judgments and related assumptions for the accounting issues concerned are outlined
below.

As part of purchase price allocations in business combinations, goodwill is the difference between the acquired net assets
evaluated according to IFRS 3 and the consideration transferred plus the fair value of the previously held shares and the amount
recognized of non-controlling interests. Various valuation methods are used for this that are primarily based on estimates and
assumptions. Insofar as contingent purchase price components are agreed, the expected future consideration is measured as
part of the acquisition and recognized as other financial liabilities. These include future milestone payments or license fees,
the probability of which is estimated at the time of the company acquisition and discounts based on the expected payment
dates in order to determine the amount of the other financial liability. In subsequent periods, this assessment is updated and
the change is recognized in profit or loss at fair value under other expenses.

Nidda carries out an impairment test for capitalized goodwill at least once a year. The discounted future cash flows of the
cash-generating units, aggregated into operating segments, which are based on certain assumptions, are to be determined
for this purpose. In this regard, both an allocation from “corporate assets” to the carrying amounts of the respective cashgenerating units and an allocation from “corporate costs” are carried out in the calculation of the respective value in use on
the basis of individual appropriate distribution keys. The discounted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use,
applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three years based on
approved budgets. Due to current market developments in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic, no earnings adjustment
was applied to planning because current market uncertainties are appropriately reflected.. Accordingly, the interest rate
determined on the cash-generating units includes the market parameters influenced by the Covid-19 pandemic. For the period
after this three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of 50% of the expected longterm inflation rate is assumed. The budget values for future financial years, which are subject to some uncertainty due to
unforeseeable future legal developments and developments in the health care market, as well as the parameters determined
in the context of current market information but also as a best possible estimate mean that the assessment of impairment
may differ from actual circumstances, and despite good forecasts in the reporting year an impairment requirement may be
necessary in subsequent years.

For items of property plant and equipment and intangible assets, the expected useful lives and associated amortization or
depreciation expenses are determined on the basis of the expectations and assessments of management. If the actual useful
life is less than the expected useful life, the amount of depreciation or amortization is adjusted accordingly. As part of the
determination of impairment losses on fixed assets, estimates relating to the cause, timing and amount of the impairments
are also made. Particularly in the context of impairment tests for as yet unused approvals, which are reported as advance
payments, the growth rates applied for the present value test as well as the long-term price and cost development of active
pharmaceutical ingredients are based on best possible estimates. This also applies to the impairment tests of other intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives.

Development costs are capitalized based on the assessment of whether the capitalization requirements of IAS 38 are met.
Planning calculations are necessary to determine the future economic benefit, which are by their nature subject to estimates
and may therefore deviate from actual circumstances in the future.

Nidda makes valuation allowances on receivables in order to anticipate losses expected in relation to the insolvency of
customers. The maturity structure of the net receivables and past experience in relation to bad debts as well as the customers’
creditworthiness are used as the criteria for evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation allowances. This does not, however,
exclude the possibility that the actual derecognitions will exceed the expected valuation allowances due to a significant
worsening in the financial position of the customer. Accounting judgments and estimates regarding the assessment of the
value of receivables relate particularly to impaired receivables from debtors in CEE countries.

The Group operates in various countries and must pay respective income taxes in each tax jurisdiction. In order to calculate
the income tax provisions and deferred taxes in the Group, the expected income tax as well as the temporary differences
resulting from the different treatment of certain items according to IFRS and their accounting in accordance with tax law are
each to be determined on the basis of assumptions. If the final taxation imposed deviates from the assumed values, this has
a corresponding effect on actual and deferred taxes and thus on the business, financial and earnings situation of the Group in
the respective period. Furthermore, increasing importance within the Nidda Group is being allotted to a comprehensive
tax transfer-pricing model for the payment of intercompany services. Potential risks of non-recognition of these transfer prices
for tax purposes is limited by way of the introduction of corresponding agreement procedures and a comprehensive definition
of transfer prices in the form of a Group guideline. If it is probable that amounts recognized in the tax returns cannot be
realized, tax liabilities are recognized which are measured at the most probable amount or the expected value.

When determining the fair values of derivatives and other financial instruments, for which no market price in an active market
is available, valuation models based on input parameters observable in the market are applied. The cash flows, which are
already fixed or calculated by means of the current yield curve using so-called “forward rates”, are discounted to the measurement date with the discount factors determined by means of the yield curve valid on the reporting date.

The amount of pension obligations from defined benefit plans is calculated using actuarial methods. This procedure is based
upon assumptions, among other things, regarding the discount rate, life expectancy and future salary and pension increases.
Changes to these assumptions can significantly influence the amount of future pension costs. For German Group companies,
pension obligations are calculated based on the biometric accounting principles of the Heubeck 2018G mortality tables.
Outside Germany, country-specific mortality tables are used. Future pension benefits are subject to individual pension agreements. The discount rate shall be based on long-term rates of return on high quality corporate bonds with fixed interest rates
at the reporting date. In countries where there is no liquid market in such corporate bonds, the discount rate is determined
on the basis of market yields on government bonds.

The creation of other provisions is based on the assessment of management regarding the probability and amount of an outflow of resources. Provisions are created if there is a present external obligation and a probable outflow of resources, i.e. if it
is more likely to occur than not. Provisions in relation to pending legal disputes are created based on estimates of the prospects
of success of these methods. The determination of provisions for damages is also associated with substantial estimates and
can change due to new information. The same applies for the recognition of the amount of contingent liabilities.

Expenses from the creation of provisions for warranties are considered in sales and charged against income. Estimated values
based on past experience are used for this purpose. This means that the actual expenses for returns may differ from the
estimate and sales would accordingly turn out to be higher or lower. The same applies for the consideration of discounts
(e.g. discounts to health insurance organizations) prescribed by law and due to other regulatory requirements. These are
recognized with a reduction on sales based on the respective underlying contract with an estimated amount in expectation
of probable sales.

##### Notes to the Consolidated Income Statement

**11. Sales**

Sales are generated exclusively in the STADA (sub) Group and are based primarily on the supply of products and, to a lesser
extent, on license revenues. For information on the reporting of sales, please refer to the details included in Accounting Policies.

In financial year 2021, achieved sales were € 3,249.5 million (previous year: € 3,010.3 million).

This development was primarily attributable to sales increases in the Generics segment in Europe, in the Consumer Healthcare
segment in Europe and CIS and in the Specialty segment in Europe, CIS and Germany as well as to the acquisitions made.
Exchange rate-related effects reduced sales in the previous year by € 2.1 million.

**12. Cost of sales**

Cost of sales is divided into the following items:

in k € **2021** **2020**

Material expenses 1,298,213 1,144,637

Impairment, depreciation and amortization 364,982 346,778

Expenses from inventory write-downs 70,933 69,717

Remaining cost of sales 144,520 125,257

**Total** **1,878,649** **1,686,389**

Depreciation and amortization in the amount of € 365.0 million (previous year: € 346.8 million) mainly included amortization
on intangible assets, the ownership of which represents a necessary condition for the marketing of the products manufactured
– in particular drug approvals.

Expenses from inventory write-downs included inventories written down to net realizable value netted with reversals. Reversals
amounted to € 11.7 million (previous year: € 7.6 million) in financial year 2021.

**13. Selling expenses**

In addition to the costs for sales departments and the sales force, selling expenses also comprise costs for advertising and
marketing activities including samples for doctors. They also include all costs for logistics that occur for completed final
products. Discounts in the form of free retail packages, so-called discounts in kind – if possible under the legal regulations in
a national market – are not included. The resulting expenses are reported as a part of cost of sales.

In the reporting year, marketing costs of € 335.3 million (previous year: € 301.1 million) corresponded to a share of 46.7% in
selling expenses (previous year: 46.2%). In addition, selling expenses included depreciation in the amount of € 17.6 million
(previous year: € 19.1 million).

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements 2021  |  Notes

**14. General and administrative expenses**

Personnel and material costs of service and administrative units are reported under general and administrative expenses,
unless they have been charged to other functional areas as internal services.

In 2021, the general and administrative expenses included depreciation in the amount of € 18.5 million (previous year:
€ 17.0 million).

General and administrative expenses increased in the reporting year by € 232.7 million (previous year: € 248.9 million). This
increase resulted, among other things, from the acquisitions made. The share of general and administrative expenses in Group
sales was 7.2% (previous year: 8.3%).

**15. Research and development expenses**

For information on the composition of research and development expenses, please refer to the details included in the Accounting Policies.

In financial year 2021, research and development expenses increased by € 1.6 million compared to the previous year.
Research and development expenses included depreciation in the amount of € 4.2 million (previous year: € 4.5 million).
Development costs for new products in the amount of € 27.0 million (previous year: € 18.4 million) were capitalized in financial year 2021.

**16. Other income**

Other income is divided into the following items:

in k € **2021** **2020**

Income from the disposal of non-current assets 1,823 1,947

Income from the reversal of impairments on receivables 1,404 8,806

Income from received insurance compensations 353 154

Income from write-ups 4,010 5,282

Remaining other income 46,320 16,162

**Total** **53,910** **32,351**

In the financial year, impairments on receivables in the amount of € 1.4 million were reversed (previous year: € 8.8 million).

Income from write-ups of € 4.0 million in financial year 2021 (previous year: € 5.3 million) related for the most part to Specialty
products. The write-ups relate to drug approvals and trademarks, the scheduled amortization of which is recognized in cost
of sales.

In financial year 2021, remaining other income includes income totaling € 32.2 million from the remeasurement of earnout
liabilities in connection with the acquisition of the Swedish company Lobsor Pharmaceuticals and the acquisition of additional
shares in the Vietnamese company Pymepharco in the previous year. Furthermore, the remaining other income includes, for
the most part, compensation claims and other income not directly associated with functional costs, which comprises many
insignificant individual items in the Group companies.

**17. Other expenses**

Other expenses are broken down as follows:

in k € **2021** **2020**

Expenses from valuation allowances in accounts receivable 1,753 2,370

Expenses for legal disputes -10,323 45,835

Currency translation expenses 1,029 50,358

Other personnel expenses 23,051 30,656

Losses from the disposal of non-current assets 1,176 14,001

Impairment losses on non-current assets excluding goodwill 89,081 73,496

Impairment losses on goodwill — —

Remaining other expenses 20,355 30,968

**Total** **126,122** **247,684**

Other expenses include impairment losses of € 89.1 million (previous year: € 73.5 million) that only concern impairment losses
on current assets excluding goodwill in the reporting year. These impairment losses mainly relate to intangible assets. The
impairment losses relate to various pharmaceutical approvals and trademarks, the scheduled amortization of which is reported
within cost of sales. The impairments in the current financial year are primarily attributable to an approval in the Specialty
segment (€ 34.5 million) and to three approvals in the Consumer Healthcare segment (€ 34.8 million) due to negative future
prospects.

In other expenses, in the reporting year expenses from impairments on receivables in the amount of € 1.8 million (previous
year: € 2.4 million) were recognized.

In addition, other expenses in the reporting year also included net currency translation expenses in the amount of € 1.0 million
(previous year: € 50.4 million) which are made up of currency translation income of € 36.2 million (previous year: € 77.3 million) and currency exchange expenses of € 37.2 million (previous year: € 127.7 million). This development was based on adverse
developments in the significant currencies in various national currencies. In particular, there was increased income in the
reporting year as compared to the corresponding prior-year period due to the appreciation of the Russian ruble for liabilities
in the transaction currency euro.

Losses from the disposal of non-current assets amounted to € 1.2 million (previous year: € 14.0 million). In the previous year,
these losses mainly included effects from the deconsolidation of the Argentinian subsidiary Laboratorio Vannier S.A. as well
as the British subsidiaries Slam Trading Limited and LAS Trading Limited.

Additionally, remaining other expenses included personnel expenses in the amount of € 23.1 million (previous year: € 30.7 million), which resulted primarily from expenses resulting from changes in management. The regular personnel expenses are
appropriately allocated to the respective specialist departments. Primarily, the severance payments affected employees whose
regular personnel costs were recorded under administrative costs.

Income from the reversal of provisions for legal disputes of € 10.3 million (previous year: expenses for legal disputes of
€ 45.8 million) included in other expenses in the reporting year mainly related to the partial reversal of provisions for damages
recognized in the previous year in Germany and the CIS region.

The following overview explains how the effective income tax expense reported in the income statement was derived from
the expected income tax expense. The expected income tax expense is calculated by applying the nominal tax rate of Nidda
German Topco GmbH to earnings before taxes. The tax effects of the respective tax rates to be applied locally depending on
their applicable national and legal forms are reported in a separate reconciliation.

Effective income tax rate (in %) n/a n/a

The nominal income tax rate for the 2021 financial year for Nidda German Topco GmbH in Germany was 28.3%, whereby this
includes corporate income tax at a rate of 15.0% and the solidarity surcharge of 5.5% on corporate income tax as well as trade
tax on income at an assessment rate of 357%.

The effects from tax rate changes mainly relate to deferred tax liabilities in the United Kingdom due to the adopted tax rate
increase from 19% to 25% as of April 1, 2022.

The tax effects from loss carryforwards/interest carryforwards and prior-year taxes mainly resulted from unrecognized deferred
tax assets on tax losses and interest carried forward due to non-deductible interest expenses (so-called interest barrier rule)
in Germany.

The tax effects from non-deductible expenses mainly result from (partial) additions for generally deductible financing expenses.
The other tax effects resulted mainly from effects of the STADA (sub) Group.

The actual income taxes and deferred taxes recognized in the balance sheet were as follows:

**Deferred taxes as per balance sheet** **41,924** **50,591** **924,383** **919,155**

Deferred tax liabilities reported resulted mainly from deferred taxes in the context of business combinations under IFRS 3.
The increase in deferred tax liabilities from intangible assets compared with the previous year was primarily a result of tax rate
increases in the United Kingdom. In total, deferred tax liabilities rose to € 924.4 million as of December 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020: € 919.2 million). This development was mainly attributable to the previously described increase in temporary
differences from intangible assets. The reduction in loss carryforwards resulted in particular from the utilization of tax loss
carryforwards.

Tax advantages that are expected from the future utilization of tax loss carryforwards are reported under “Deferred taxes from
loss carryforwards”, insofar as their utilization is probable. Tax loss carryforwards capitalized as of the balance sheet date
December 31, 2021 amounted to € 15.4 million in financial year 2021 (previous year: € 64.1 million).

the impairment test of December 31, 2021, an unchanged royalty rate of 1.5% and a discount rate of 5.4% (December 31,
2020: 5.4%) were used. There was no impairment need in the reporting year.

As of December 31, 2021, the Hemofarm umbrella brand continues to have a carrying amount of € 39.7 million. In the context
of the impairment test of December 31, 2021, an unchanged royalty rate of 2%, as in the previous year, and a discount rate
of 8.4% (December 31, 2020: 9.3%) were used. There was no necessity for impairment for the reporting year.

As of December 31, 2021, the Pymepharco umbrella brand has a carrying amount of € 8.3 million. In the context of the impairment test of December 31, 2021, an unchanged royalty rate of 2% and a discount rate of 9.7% (December 31, 2020: 10.2%)

The umbrella brand Nizhpharm with a carrying amount of € 9.9 million (December 31, 2020: € 10.0 million) as of December
31, 2021, will be amortized as scheduled over its useful life. Due to the exchange rate development of the Russian ruble, the
carrying amount in the current financial year remained at the level of the previous year.

Borrowing costs capitalized in 2021 for intangible assets and directly attributable to the acquisition or production amounted
to € 5.1 million (previous year: € 4.2 million). In financial year 2021, the capitalization rate taken as a basis for determining
borrowing costs eligible for capitalization was 3.3% (previous year: 3.2%).

Capitalized development costs consist mainly of costs that can be allocated to the projects, such as the costs of individuals working in development, material costs and external services, together with directly allocatable overhead costs. Internally created intangible
assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life (generally 20 years). Development costs that do not qualify
for capitalization are recognized immediately as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. In financial year 2021,
these development costs amounted to of € 86.5 million (previous year: € 84.9 million).

Scheduled amortization on intangible assets mainly relates to regulatory drug approvals as well as trademarks and is recognized
in the income statement primarily under cost of sales. In the reporting year, this related to an amount of € 336.8 million
(previous year: € 321.2 million).

In financial year 2021, impairments on intangible assets were recognized in the total amount of € 88.8 million (previous year:
€ 67.6 million). Impairments mainly related to an approval in the Specialty segment (€ 34.5 million), and to three approvals
in the Consumer Healthcare segment (€ 34.8 million) due to negative future prospects. No valuation allowances on goodwill
were recorded in the reporting year.

The following amortization expense is expected for intangible assets in the next five years:

**Expected amortization in k €**

2022 344,001

In the context of the takeover of STADA Arzneimittel AG, goodwill was recognized. The STADA Group is managed as a cashgenerating unit in the Nidda Group, for this reason the goodwill impairment test is carried out at this level. The increase
in goodwill in 2021 relates primarily to the acquisition of Friska LLC. The further increase resulted from exchange-rate related
changes.

in € million **Dec. 31, 2021** **Dec. 31, 2020**

Residual carrying amount goodwill 575.3 566.9

As part of the regular impairment test for capitalized goodwill as of November 30, 2021, the expected cash outflow was
determined based on the discounted cash flow procedure using the following defined parameters:

in %

Growth in the 2021 update phase 1.2

Pre tax WACC 2021 8.3

In the previous year, the parameters that were applied as of November 30, 2020 were as follows:

in %

Growth in the 2020 update phase 1.2

Pre tax WACC 2020 10.0

The discounted cash flow method is used to determine value in use of the cash-generating units, applying an individual interest rate for the cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three years. Such a detailed planning period reflects
the assumptions of short to medium-term market developments. For the period after this three-year detailed planning horizon,
a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of 50% the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. In the previous year,
for the period after the three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of the expected
long-term inflation rate is assumed. The detailed planning period for determining values in use is based on certain assumptions
that are based on past experience, complemented by internal developments, and verified based on external market data and
analyses. Key assumptions include the development of future selling prices or quantities, costs, the influence of the regulatory

market environment, investments, market share, foreign exchange rates, and growth rates. Only temporary influences are
expected from the Covid-19 pandemic, which will be offset within a year, which is why no discount has been planned. The
interest rate calculated on the cash-generating units includes the market parameters influenced by the Covid-19 pandemic
accordingly. Significant changes to the aforementioned assumptions would influence the determination of the values in use
of the cash-generating units. The discount rates used are determined based on external factors derived from the market and
are adjusted for the risks predominant in the cash- generating units in question.

Changes in the calculation parameters used for the impairment tests may influence the fair values of cash-generating units.
A sensitivity analysis was therefore carried out for the cash-generating units with a 1.0 percentage points higher discount rate,
a decrease in the growth rate of 0.5 percentage points and a decrease in EBIT of 10.0 percentage points. Based on these
assumptions, there was no need for impairment.

In the previous year, the use of assumptions for the sensitivity analysis (1.0 percentage point higher discount rate, 0.5 percentage point reduction in the growth rate and 10.0 percentage point reduction in EBIT) resulted in a need for impairment in
the amount of:

**Sensitivity analysis – impact on the need for impairment** **WACC** **Growth rates** **EBIT**
in € million **+1.0 percentage points** **-0.5 percentage points** **-10.0 percentage points**

Nidda 264.8 — 56.0

The following development in the respective valuation parameter would mean that the value in use of the cash-generating
unit would be equal to its carrying amount:

**Sensitivity analysis – impact on the need for impairment**
in % **WACC** **Growth rates** **EBIT**

Change in the parameter +0.7 -0.8 -9.3

Financial assets are the carrying amounts of those shares in non-consolidated investments. There is currently no intention to
sell these financial assets.

Additions to shares in affiliated companies and other investments relate to the increase in the stake in STADA (Shanghai)
Trading Co. Ltd. before it was included in the scope of consolidation in the second quarter. The first-time consolidation of this
entity is also reflected in the changes in the scope of consolidation.

The change in fair value (FVOCI) results from the exercising of the option in accordance with IFRS 9 to recognize changes in
the fair value of equity instruments in other comprehensive income. In the reporting year, as was the case in the previous year,
this related to the investment in Xbrane Biopharma AB.

Various collateral exists for a portion of trade accounts receivable the value of which was not impaired, for example in the form
of bank or corporate guarantees or pledged inventories and letters of credit. Furthermore, there is commercial credit insurance
for certain markets and customers. These are taken into account in the calculation of the default risk.

The regulations on the classification of financial assets meant, for factoring- capable receivables on the basis of the present
business model, that these financial assets, which continue to be included in trade accounts receivable, are measured at fair
value within the scope of IFRS 9. Changes in the fair value of these receivables are recognized directly in equity in the FVOCI
reserve. In this context, financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are generally subject to
the same impairment model as financial assets measured at amortized cost.

Overall, impairments on trade accounts receivable developed as follows:

For trade accounts receivable, an expected default on receivables is calculated over their terms on the basis of a portfoliospecific default rate. The default rate indicates the probability that a debtor will default within a period of one year. The default
rates consider the industry risks and the economic environment of the respective country. Each cluster is allocated to a
different bandwidth of expected default rates.

**28. Return Assets**

As of December 31, 2021, return assets due after one year amounted to € 1.0 million (December 31, 2020: € 0.8 million). The
return assets relate to expected returns in connection with agreements with customers for which reutilization is expected.

**Total** **812,088** **830,132**

In financial year 2021, impairments netted with reversals were made on the net realizable value of inventories in the amount
of € 70.9 million (previous year: € 69.7 million), which were already deducted from the amounts shown above through profit
and loss. The write-ups in this regard amounted to € 11.7 million (previous year: € 7.6 million).

**32. Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and call deposits as well as current and highly liquid financial investments
with a maximum term of 90 days from the date of acquisition. In certain countries, specific transactions are subject to special
monitoring in the context of the requirements of the respective national bank or foreign exchange acts in force. Restrictions
on the availability of cash and cash equivalents amounted to € 7.6 million (previous year: € 4.0 million) and related exclusively
to cash in China.

Development of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021 at € 594.1 million (December 31, 2020: € 278.5 million)
resulted from the effects described as part of the explanations in the consolidated cash flow statement. Further details on the
development of cash and cash equivalents can be found in the consolidated cash flow statement.

**33. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale as well as associated liabilities**

**34. Equity**

Group equity amounted to € 259.6 million as of the balance sheet date (December 31, 2020: € 250.3 million). This corresponds
to an equity ratio of 3.1% (December 31, 2020: 3.1%).

34.1. Share capital and capital reserve

Share capital amounted to € 25,000 as of December 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020: € 25,000) and was fully paid-up.

Changes in the capital reserve of the Group are shown in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. In financial year
2021 an amount of € 3.75 million from the free capital reserve was distributed to Nidda Midco S.à r.l. bx Nidda German Topco
GmbH.

The reduction of the capital reserve in financial year 2020 was mainly related to payments for the purchase of outstanding
STADA shares.

34.2. Retained earnings including net result

Retained earnings including net result comprise the net result for financial year 2021 as well as income generated in earlier
periods, insofar as there were not distributed, including amounts transferred to retained earnings. In addition, revaluations of
net debt from defined benefit plans that were recognized through other comprehensive income are reported under this item,
taking deferred taxes into account.

In the context of measuring the defined benefit obligations as of December 31, 2021, the net expense in the amount of
€ 3.4 million – not considering amounts attributable to non-controlling interests – resulted from the remeasurement (December 31, 2020: expense in the amount of € 2.8 million) after deferred taxes. In addition, this position also includes currency
translation differences related to the revaluation of net debt recognized in equity from performance-oriented pension plans
as well as the deferred taxes they incur which, in financial year 2021, amounted to income recognized in equity of € 0.4 million
(previous year: income in the amount of € 0.2 million).

In financial year 2021, retained earnings were also significantly impacted by the increase in shares in the Vietnamese subsidiary Pymepharco Joint Stock Company. The difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted
and the fair value of the consideration must be recognized in equity in accordance with IFRS 10 and allocated to the owners
of the parent company. The resulting decrease in retained earnings amounts to € 2.2 million.

34.3. Other reserves

Other reserves include results recognized directly in equity. These relate, among other things, to foreign exchange gains and
losses resulting from currency translation with no effect on income of financial statements of companies included in the Group,
which are reported in the statement of changes in equity under the currency translation reserve.

Due to the application of the new standard IFRS 9, other reserves additionally include the reserve FVOCI. Under this item, fair
value changes of the fair value receivables recognized through other comprehensive income as well as equity instruments
accounted for at fair value are accounted for without impact on profit or loss.

The increase in other reserves as compared to the previous year resulted in particular from the appreciation of the Russian
ruble and the British pound since December 31, 2020, which led to income from foreign currency translation of the companies
reporting in the Russian ruble and the British pound.

In Germany, the Group has plan assets in the form of reinsurance policies, which are used to serve the pension entitlements
of a small number of former employees. In addition, there are plan assets for a pension obligation which was outsourced to a
pension fund. All further pension entitlements are financed internally in the scope of pension provisions. In addition, there
are plan assets in a few foreign subsidiaries in the form of, among other things, insurances, government bonds and securities
funds.

In financial year 2021, the plan assets of two foreign subsidiaries exceeded their pension obligations, with the result that this
excess asset was recognized under other assets as assets from overfunded pension plans in the amount of € 1.5 million. In the
previous year, there was no excess asset at any subsidiary.

In financial year 2021, special incidents occurred in particular in Switzerland and Saudi Arabia. In Switzerland, GEMINI Sammelstiftung reduced the conversion factors used to convert the accumulated capital from retirement credits into lifelong pension
benefits. This resulted in a gain of € 0.4 million for STADA. In Saudi Arabia, employment contracts with some expatriate
employees were terminated – with this measure resulting in a gain of € 0.3 million. There were also other special incidents
with an immaterial impact on the balance sheet.

companies.

The amount of the negative income from plan assets for German Group companies is largely determined by raising the value
of the plan assets of a commitment to the value of the gross obligation on the basis of the reinsurance available for this
purpose. The return on plan assets outside Germany is mainly attributable to a positive performance of plan assets in Ireland
and Switzerland.

In the coming financial years, the following payments from the Company and from plan assets overall are expected for defined

Less than 1 year 2,310 3,088

Between 1 and 2 years 2,300 2,812

Between 4 and 5 years 2,225 3,001

Between 5 and 10 years 10,717 19,569

For the coming financial year, employer contributions consisting of direct pension payments and contributions to plan assets,
are expected in the amount of € 0.7 million for German Group companies and € 5.4 million for international Group companies.

The regulations of IAS 19 require a presentation of the benefit plans that generate obligations for the company. For the STADA
Group, pension plans in Germany, the United Kingdom and Switzerland account for the largest share of total obligations with
approximately 80%. Accordingly, the following details focus more on these countries.

In Germany, the legal framework for company pension plans is provided by the Company Pensions Act (Betriebsrentengesetz
– BetrAVG) in which minimum legal requirements are applied to company pension plans. Furthermore, regulation and legal
precedents within labor law must also be followed. The retirement benefit plans are predominantly based upon the final salary
and are concluded with newly hired employees. Plan participants are primarily beneficiaries. Benefits are paid out in the form
of a pension. In the calculation of the amount of the pension obligations, the Heubeck 2018G mortality tables were used as
a basis for consideration of mortality and fluctuation. In addition, there is a pre-retirement regulation for selected employees.

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements 2021  |  Notes

In Germany, STADA has plan assets in the form of reinsurance policies and in the form of assets in a pension fund. As of
December 31, 2021, plan assets amounted to € 31.7 million and were composed of three different plans. There were no plan
assets for two additional plans.

In the context of risk assessment, the life expectancy of plan participants plays a smaller role in Germany, as the material
obligation regarding its amount and including associated risks was outsourced externally. Furthermore, there is also the common
risk of the interest rate development.

The pension commitment for the former Chairman of the Executive Board of STADA Arzneimittel AG Hartmut Retzlaff was
transferred to a pension fund in full in financial year 2014. Despite the transfer, the necessity remains, due to the secondary
liability of STADA, to treat the benefit plan as a defined benefit plan in accordance with IAS 19 and measure and recognize it
accordingly in the balance sheet. The existing plan assets lead to a provision of zero due to offsetting that must be carried out
at the time of the plan amendment for this benefit plan. Because the pension commitment is fully funded, no further provisions
are expected in the future.

In the United Kingdom, STADA grants its employees defined benefit plans that are concluded for new hires. The employees
can also no longer earn an additional increase in their entitlements. The pension plans are subject to the United Kingdom Trust
Law and the United Kingdom Pension Regulator. The pension plans are monitored by trustees who determine the investment
strategy. The trustees are also responsible for fulfilling the legally required pension plan funding and thereby ensuring sufficient
assets to cover the technical provisions of the plan. The pension plan is subject to risks relating to the discount rate and
participant life expectancy as well as inflation risk, if these values develop contrary to expectations. If the discount rate is low,
the level of funding decreases, which may require the payment of additional contributions. There is a financing risk in plan
assets in that plan assets could develop contrary to expectations and plan assets could therefore only compensate in part for
changes in the obligations.

As of December 31, 2021, plan assets amounted to € 31.3 million. All assets have quoted market prices on an active market.
In the calculation of the amount of the pension obligations, the mortality tables of the S3 Series (S3PA) were used as a basis
for consideration of the mortality also including the projection table CMI 2020 as well as the long-term trend toward improved
mortality of 1.25%. Fluctuation assumptions are no longer relevant for the pension plan.

In Switzerland, every employer must offer its employees a pension plan in accordance with federal pension law (Bundesgesetz
über die berufliche Alters-, Hinterlassenen- und Invalidenvorsorge – BVG). Employees whose salary exceeds the entry limit
must be insured – this is re-determined periodically. The BVG requires a minimum plan (the “BVG minimum”) that must always
be covered. The Swiss benefit plan at STADA includes benefits in case of death, disability, departure and upon reaching retirement age. The annual pension is calculated based on a savings account and conversion rate determined according to the age
of retirement. Plan participants can opt for a capital option. In the calculation of the amount of the pension obligations, the
BVG 2020 GT mortality tables were used as a basis for consideration of mortality and fluctuation under consideration of future
improvements in mortality rates according to the CMI model.

Various Group companies additionally grant their employees defined contribution plans. Here, Group companies pay defined
contributions to independent institutions to meet legal or contractual requirements or on a voluntary basis; liabilities beyond
this do not exist. The contributions for defined contribution plans, which are reported as an expense in the respective period
in the relevant functional areas, amounted to € 35.6 million in financial year 2021 (previous year: € 32.3 million).

**Total** **377,387** **242,193** **382,358** **221,765**

As in the previous year, purchase price liabilities as of December 31, 2021 resulted primarily from liabilities from earnout
agreements in connection with the acquisition of Lobsor Pharmaceuticals and the acquisition of additional shares in the
Vietnamese subsidiary Pymepharco. In the reporting year, these earnout liabilities declined as part of a remeasurement as of
the balance sheet date. Also included this year are liabilities from earnout agreements in connection with the acquisition of
the US-american company Friska LLC. In addition, as in the previous year, there were outstanding purchase price liabilities for
product acquisitions in the United Kingdom.

The lease liabilities are due as follows:

**Total** **81,871** **79,060** **10,524** **10,399** **71,347** **68,661**

The increase in lease liabilities in the course of the financial year was mainly influenced by the extension of contracts in the
area of building leases.

In addition, negative market values of derivatives measured at fair value through profit or loss were reported in liabilities from
derivative financial instruments. In financial year 2021, this related to currency forwards and interest rate swaps (see Note
46.1.). Within the scope of the maturity date analysis, the following contractually agreed remaining terms result for these
derivative financial liabilities:

of € 0.2 million (previous year: € 0.0 million) after one to five years.

**43. Notes to the cash flow statement**

Cash flow from operating activities consists of changes in items not covered by capital expenditure, financing, changes in
exchange rates from the conversion of foreign financial statements or transactions in foreign currencies or through changes
in the scope of consolidation and measurement. Cash flow from operating activities amounted to € 612.2 million in the
reporting year (previous year: € 391.6 million). This development was mainly attributable to significantly higher cash outflows
from working capital, particularly for inventories and trade accounts receivable. Significantly higher cash outflows from working
capital in the previous year resulted, among other things, from a build-up for the companies and product-portfolios acquired
in financial year 2020 while they were part of the Group. The decrease in other non-cash income and expenses compared with
the previous year resulted on the one hand from significantly higher additions to provisions for damages in the previous year,
particularly in Germany and the CIS region and, on the other hand, from significant income from the adjustment of earnout
liabilities recognized in profit or loss and income from the reversal of provisions for damages in financial year 2021 recognized
in the previous year.

Cash flow from investing activities reflects the cash outflows for investments less proceeds from disposals. This amounted to
€ -307.8 million in the reporting year (previous year: € -1,225.3 million).

In financial year 2021, cash outflows for investments in intangible assets amounted to € 236.1 million (previous year:
€ 433.2 million). Of this amount, € 206.3 million (previous year: € 407.8 million) was attributable to payments for significant
investments in intangible assets for the expansion of the product portfolio which, particularly to the acquisition of a product
portfolio from Sanofi. In the context of business combinations, net cash outflows resulted mainly from the acquisition of
US-based Friska LLC. This was offset by sales tax refunds for the purchase price payments made in the previous year in relation
to the acquisition of the Takeda product portfolio.

Proceeds from the disposal of non-current assets amounted to € 2.8 million in the financial year (previous year: € 4.8 million).
Proceeds from the disposal of shares in consolidated companies as well as from the disposal of non-current assets held for
sale resulted in the previous year from the sale of the Argentinian company Laboratorio Vannier as well as the British companies Slam Trading Limited and LAS Trading Limited.

Cash flow from financing activities includes payments from changes in financial liabilities, for dividend distributions and from
additions to equity. In addition, interest paid is included. Cash flow from financing activities amounted to € 5.5 million in the
financial year 2021 (previous year: € 911.7 million).

This development was mainly due to significantly lower cash inflows from borrowings and higher interest payments. In financial year 2021, there was mainly an increase in commitments for Facility F equivalent to € 350 million under the existing
syndicated loan agreement of Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH. In the previous year, significant borrowings resulted mainly
from the bonds issued by Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH with a total nominal value of € 550.0 million and further credit
facilities under the syndicated loan agreement with a total nominal amount of € 260.0 million. In addition, in the previous
year there were proceeds from an escrow account in connection with a bond issued in the forth quarter of 2019 with a nominal value of € 600.0 million to finance the Takeda acquisition, the closing of which took place in the first quarter of 2020. In
contrast, there were lower cash outflows from the repayment of financial liabilities compared to the previous year, which in
financial year 2021 related, among other things, to the scheduled repayment of promissory note loans in the amount of
€ 41.5 million. In addition, payments from the change in minority interests in connection with further share acquisitions in
the Vietnamese subsidiary Pymepharco were recorded in the reporting year. In the previous year, however, this item was
characterized by significantly higher payments, which were significantly influenced by the acquisition of additional shares in
STADA from minority shareholders as well as payments in the context of the squeeze-out.

Payments for dividend distributions amounted to € 24.2 million related entirely to dividends paid to the non-controlling
interests within the STADA Group.

Free cash flow as the total of cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from investing activities amounted to € 304.4 million in financial year 2021 (previous year: € -833.7 million).

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements 2021  |  Notes

Cash pursuant to IAS 7 is made up of cash and cash equivalents.

Free cash flow, adjusted for effects from payments for significant investments and acquisitions and effects of proceeds from
significant disposals is calculated as follows:

in k € **2021** **2020**

Cash flow from operating activities 612,229 391,603

Cash flow from investing activities -307,820 -1,225,343

+ payments for investments in business combinations in accordance with IFRS 3 (incl. VAT) -5,087 731,053

+ payments for significant investments in intangible assets for the short-term expansion of the product
portfolio 206,278 407,830

– proceeds from disposals in significant disinvestments — —

– proceeds (+)/payments (-) from disposals in consolidated companies — 0

– proceeds (+)/payments (-) from the sale of non-current assets held for sale (IFRS 5) — -231

**Adjusted free cash flow** **505,599** **305,374**

**44. Contingent liabilities**

Contingent liabilities describe possible obligations to third parties based on past events but which will not become manifest
until the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events, which are not under Nidda’s control. As of the balance sheet date,
these contingent liabilities were considered improbable and are therefore not accounted for. In addition, there are also
contingent liabilities for current obligations, for which however the associated outflow of resources is not considered probable
or the amount of the obligation cannot be adequately estimated.

In the Group, there are contingent liabilities in connection, among other things, with patent risks for certain active pharmaceutical ingredients and associated pending or impending proceedings. The possible obligations amounted to approximately
€ 30.7 million as of December 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020: € 14.2 million). The increase of € 16.5 million compared with
the previous year is mainly due to the new patent risk for active pharmaceutical ingredients.

Provisions were not created for contingent liabilities as the probability of an outflow of assets is under 50%. Outflows potentially resulting from these risks would generally be short-term.

**45. Other financial obligations**

In addition to the contingent liabilities, there are also other future financial obligations, which can be broken down as follows:

in k € **Dec. 31, 2021** **Dec. 31, 2020**

Obligations from leases 5,176 5,432

Other financial obligations 120,063 94,876

**Total** **125,239** **100,308**

Information on future obligations from leases includes obligations from short-term leases as well as leases for low-value assets
because these are not accounted for in other financial liabilities.

Total future minimum leasing payments based on leases is comprised as follows after their remaining terms:

**Lease liabilities**

in k € **Dec. 31, 2021** **Dec. 31, 2020**

Remaining term up to 1 year 4,261 4,250

Remaining terms over 1 year to 5 years 915 1,164

Remaining terms over 5 years — 18

**Total** **5,176** **5,432**

The obligations for short-term leases amounted to € 0.5 million as of December 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020: € 0.4 million).

Lease payments in the amount of € 25.0 million were recognized as an expense in financial year 2021 (previous year: € 17.5 million). This included expenses in the amount of € 0,7 million (previous year: € 1.2 million) for short-term leases and € 1.1 million (previous year: € 0.8 million) for leases for low-value assets.

Other financial obligations include long-term obligations for logistics and accounting services. In addition, bona fide contingent
liabilities in the amount of € 52.7 million (previous year: € 36.0 million) in Spain, Belgium and the United Kingdom and further
guarantees assumed on the part of the STADA Group are included in other financial liabilities.

Because cash and cash equivalents as well as trade accounts receivable mainly have short residual terms, their carrying amounts
as of the closing date correspond approximately to their fair value.

Deviations of the fair values from the carrying amounts occur as shown in the chart above in the case of promissory note loans,
bonds as well as liabilities to banks. The cash flows calculated by means of the current yield curve were discounted to the
measurement date to determine the fair values for liabilities to banks.

The fair values of remaining financial receivables and of financial investments held until maturity with a remaining term of less
than one year correspond to the present values of the payments connected with the assets taking into consideration the
respective current interest parameters that reflect market and partner-related changes in conditions and expectations. Trade

accounts payable as well as remaining financial liabilities also regularly have short remaining terms so that the recognized
values approximate the fair values.

Financial assets recognized at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) include factorable receivables. These
financial assets, which are still included in trade accounts receivable, are recognized at fair value through other comprehensive
income. Changes in the fair value of these receivables – which differs from the measurement at amortized cost to only a minor
extent – are recognized through other comprehensive income in the FVOCI reserve. Included in this category are also the
shares acquired in the reporting period from the Swedish company XBrane. Because the company’s shares are traded on the
stock exchange, they have been classified in Level 1.

In the context of the preparation of the financial statements, the allocation to the respective hierarchy levels is reviewed
according to information available on the determination of the fair values. If a need for reclassification is determined, the
reclassification is carried out as of the beginning of the reporting period. In the financial year, there were no reclassifications
among the respective hierarchy levels.

The fair values are analyzed in the context of the preparation of the financial statements. For this purpose, market comparisons
and change analyses are carried out.

Derivative financial assets (FVPL) and derivative financial liabilities (FVPL) include, as in the previous year, positive or negative
market values of derivative financial instruments (currency swaps and interest rate swaps) not part of a hedging relationship.
The fair values of currency forwards are determined using financial mathematics based on current market data provided by a
reputable information service, such as spot exchange rates or swap rates, in one system according to standardized procedures.
In the previous year, the fair values were determined using appropriate valuation models by external third parties.

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements 2021  |  Notes

In the Group, as of the balance sheet date, currency forwards (EUR/CZK, EUR/USD and EUR/AUD) are designated as fair value
hedges that are concluded to hedge currency risks from intercompany loans with companies that keep their accounting in a
local currency other than euros. The changes in value of the underlying transaction which result from changes to the respective
currency exchange rates, are offset by the changes in value of the spot components of the currency forwards. The objective
of fair value hedges is to hedge against the currency risk of these financial liabilities. Credit risks are not part of this hedging.
The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is reviewed both prospectively and retrospectively on each closing date. As of
the closing date, all designated hedging relationships were sufficiently effective.

In financial year 2021, as in the previous year, there were no financial assets and liabilities allocated to hierarchy level 3 and
recognized at fair value.

46.2. Net earnings from financial instruments by valuation category

The disclosure of interest from financial instruments is made in financial income and financial expenses in the interest result.
Dividends received are disclosed in investment income. With the exception of the valuation results from interest rate swaps,
and/or currency swaps recognized at fair value through profit or loss, which are reported under financial income or financial
expenses and partially also in the currency translation result, disclosure of the remaining components of net earnings is made
in other income or other expenses. Earnings from the disposal of financial instruments relate to the fulfillment of currency
swaps.

46.3. Factoring

Factoring transactions with the transfer of essentially all opportunities and risks

There are revolving receivable selling agreements with banks and financial institutes (together “receivables buyers”) with the
transfer of essentially all opportunities and risks for two agreements without a general purchase limit and for two agreements
with a purchase limit of € 17.5 million. The agreements have an unlimited term with regular termination possibilities, whereby
Nidda is free to decide if and in what amount the revolving nominal volume is utilized. The risks that are relevant for the risk
evaluation with regard to the sold receivables are the credit risk as well as the risk of delayed payment (late payment risk). In
return for a fixed program fee recognized in expenses at the time of derecognition, both risks are fully transferred to the buyer
of the receivable and for two programs through the payment of monthly discount fees.

The nominal volume of receivables sold but not yet paid under the factoring agreements, translated into euro, amounted to
€ 32.3 million on the reporting date.

Factoring transactions with distribution of essential opportunities and risks for which control of the asset
remains with the Nidda Group

There are factoring agreements pursuant to which, on a revolving basis, trade accounts receivable up to a total general purchase
limit of € 137.2 million are sold to banks and financial institutes. The agreements have an unlimited term with regular termination possibilities, whereby the Nidda Group is free to decide if and in what amount the revolving nominal volume is utilized.
The risks that are relevant for the risk evaluation with regard to the sold receivables are the credit risk as well as the risk of
delayed payment (late payment risk). The credit risk is partially transferred to the buyer of the receivable. The late payment
risk continues to be borne in its entirety. The maximum credit risk to be borne, translated into euro, amounted to € 0.9 million
as of the reporting date. The other credit-risk related defaults are assumed by the buyer. The late payment risk continues to
be borne in its entirety by the Group. The maximum risk of loss for the Group resulting from the credit risk and the late payment
risk from the receivables sold as of the reporting date, translated into euro, amounted to € 1.0 million. The nominal volume
of receivables sold but not yet paid under the factoring agreements, translated into euro, amounted to € 79.9 million on the
reporting date. The ongoing commitment of the Group as of December 31, 2021, translated into euro, amounted to € 1.0 million and the carrying amount of the associated liability, translated into euro, amounted to € 1.0 million.

**47. Risk management and derivative financial instruments**

47.1. Principles of risk management

The basic principles of finance policy and of financial risk management are determined or confirmed at least once annually by
the Management in the context of the budget process. Furthermore, transactions above a certain relevance threshold determined by the Executive Board require a prior decision on the part of Management and may also be subject to approval from
the Supervisory Board. Management is also regularly informed of the nature, scope and amount of current risks.

47.2. Currency risks

The reporting and Group currency is the euro. Due to the international alignment of business activities, the Group is subject
to risks arising from exchange rate fluctuations.

On the one hand, these risks consist of potential changes in value, especially of receivables and liabilities in a currency other
than the respective functional currency as a result of exchange rate fluctuation (transaction risk).

F-100


-----

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements 2021  |  Notes

However, the Group is only subject to this risk to a limited extent, as the company counters currency risks through, alongside
natural hedges, the use of derivative financial instruments. These are used to hedge currency risks from operating activities,
financial transactions and investments. In the reporting year, use was made of foreign-exchange futures contracts and interest/
currency swaps. The maturity dates of futures contracts are adjusted to the term of the underlying transactions. The remaining term of the contracts is currently up to one year.

In the context of the Consolidated Financial Statements, on the other hand, exchange rate fluctuations lead to an accounting
effect as a result of the conversion of the balance sheet items as well as the conversion of earnings and expenses of international Group companies with a different functional currency than euro (translation risk). The appreciation of the euro as
compared to the other currencies is generally negative and depreciation is generally positive.

Determined quantitative disclosures were made on risks in connection with currency changes by means of aggregating all of
the Group companies’ foreign currency items that are not denominated in the respective Group company’s functional currency.
In the case of hedging transactions, they are compared with the balances of assets or equity and liabilities from the aggregation. This results in the subsequent material outstanding foreign currency items as of the respective reporting dates, which
in case of a change to the foreign currency item due to a 10% appreciation or a 10% devaluation of the euro in comparison
with the respective functional currency are as follows:

**Dec. 31, 2021**

in k € **British pound** **Russian ruble** **US dollar**

Outstanding foreign currency item -318,087 -174,419 90,218

Income (+)/expense (-) from an appreciation of the euro in comparison to
the respective functional currency by 10% 34,202 -23,599 -9,022

Income (+)/expense (-) from a depreciation of the euro in comparison to
the respective functional currency by 10% -34,202 23,599 9,022

Equity increase (+)/equity reduction (-) from an appreciation of the euro in comparison to
the respective functional currency by 10% 33,440 -47,397 -9,058

Equity increase (+)/equity reduction (-) from a depreciation of the euro in comparison to
the respective functional currency by 10% -33,440 47,397 9,058

**Dec. 31, 2020**

in k € **British pound** **Russian ruble** **US dollar**

Outstanding foreign currency item -291,633 -120,818 111,475

Income (+)/expense (-) from an appreciation of the euro in comparison to
the respective functional currency by 10% 27,147 -27,216 -11,147

Income (+)/expense (-) from a depreciation of the euro in comparison to
the respective functional currency by 10% -27,147 27,216 11,147

Equity increase (+)/equity reduction (-) from an appreciation of the euro in comparison to
the respective functional currency by 10% 23,549 -52,755 -11,148

Equity increase (+)/equity reduction (-) from a depreciation of the euro in comparison to
the respective functional currency by 10% -23,549 52,755 11,148

In this regard, any currency risk is isolated, i.e. it is taken into account without mutual dependencies.

F-101


-----

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements 2021  |  Notes

The outstanding foreign currency items British pounds and Russian rubles relate to a balance from foreign currency holdings
from German and international Group companies in British pounds and Russian rubles and outstanding foreign currency
reserves in euro. The reported outstanding foreign currency positions in US dollars relate exclusively to foreign currency
holdings in US dollars at German and international Group companies.

The risk in connection with the outstanding foreign currency reserves in euro, from the Group’s perspective, results from the
functional currency of the respective international Group company. Overall, based on outstanding foreign currency items as
of the reporting date, an appreciation or a devaluation of the respective functional currency by 10% compared to the currencies of relevance for the Group would have led to an effect on earnings in the amount of income of € 0.7 million (December 31,
2020 € 28.2 million) or in the amount of an expense of € 0.7 million (Decemebr 31, 2020: earnings of € 28.2 million).

47.3. Interest rate risks

Interest risks from the investment of financial assets as well as financial debts, stand primarily in Euro. In 2021, an average of
48% (previous year: 51%) of financial liabilities denominated in euro had fixed interest rates. Currently there are no cash flow
hedges in the form of interest rate swaps.

Existing interest rate risks are calculated using sensitivity analyses, which show the effects of changes in market interest rates
on interest payments, interest income and expenses as well as equity. The following factors – if relevant – are generally included
in the calculation:

- Changes in the market interest rate of original financial liabilities with variable interest rates that are not hedged against
interest rate risks, and

- Changes in the market interest rate of interest derivatives not part of a hedging relationship.

in € million **Dec. 31, 2021** **Dec. 31, 2020**

Income (+)/expense (-) from an increase in the market interest rate level of 100 basis points -11.3 -6.3

Income (+)/expense (-) from a decrease in the market interest rate level of 100 basis points +0.6 +0.4

The interest-rate risk is of secondary importance.

47.4. Default risks

The Group is exposed to a default risk in its operating business if contracting parties fail to meet their obligations. Alongside
the implementation of appropriate credit management processes, such transactions are generally only concluded with counterparties of impeccable financial standing to avoid default risks in financing activities.

Default risks also exist as a result of the supply of goods and services. Business relations are sought only with partners of
impeccable financial standing. In addition, the Group partly uses suitable measures such as guarantees, loan insurances or the
transfer of assets to safeguard itself against default risk. Past due receivables in the operating area are continuously monitored
and potential default risks are anticipated through the creation of valuation adjustments. Furthermore, there is the risk that
in a difficult economic and financial environment, national health care systems delay or fail to make payments to Group companies or business partners of the Group and that, as a result, directly or indirectly increased default risks arise. The maximum
credit default risk is calculated from the carrying amount of the financial assets recognized. In addition, the Group granted
guarantees that amounted to a total nominal volume of € 53.7 million as of the reporting date (December 31, 2020: € 36.9 million). Various forms of collateral for credit securities are held, such as mortgages, bank or corporate guarantees, assignments
of receivables and pledged inventories. Furthermore, there is commercial credit insurance for certain markets and customers.

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements 2021  |  Notes

47.5. Liquidity risks

Liquidity risks may result, for example, from the loss of existing cash items, lack of availability of credit, reduced access to
financing markets or fluctuation in the operational development of business. The goal of liquidity management is to ensure
solvency and financial flexibility of the Group at all times by maintaining a sufficient supply of liquidity reserves. Financing is
obtained through short-term and long-term borrowings from banks, promissory note loans, bonds and factoring. Furthermore,
the Group also has solid operating cash flow.

47.6. Derivative financial instruments and hedging instruments

Currency risks are countered with derivative financial instruments, which are exclusively used to hedge interest and currency
risks resulting from operating activities and financial transactions. Derivative financial instruments are neither held nor issued
for speculation purposes.

The total volume of currency and interest rate related derivatives is comprised as follows:

**Dec. 31, 2021** **Dec. 31, 2020**

in k € **Nominal value** **Fair value** **Nominal value** **Fair value**

**Derivatives without hedging relationship**

**Total** **938,620** **-1,746** **1,005,297** **-2,839**

In the Group, as of the balance sheet date, currency forwards (EUR/CZK, EUR/USD and EUR/AUD) are designated as fair value
hedges that are concluded to hedge the currency risks from intercompany loans with companies that keep their accounting
in a local currency other than euros. The changes in value of the underlying transaction which result from changes to the
respective currency exchange rates, are offset by the changes in value of the spot components of the currency forwards. The
objective of fair value hedges is to hedge against the currency risk of these financial liabilities. Credit risks are not part of this
hedging. The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is reviewed both prospectively and retrospectively on each closing date.
As of the closing date, all designated hedging relationships were sufficiently effective. In the reporting period, new fair value
hedges with a nominal volume totaling € 247.0 million were designated for reduction of the fair value risk (December 31,
2020: € 429.0 million). As of December 31, 2021, currency derivatives with a net fair value of k € 838 (December 31, 2020:
k € 11) were designated as hedging instruments within the scope of fair value hedges. Gains recognized in the currency translation result in financial year 2021 of k € 5,467 resulted from the carrying amount adjustment of the hedged item (previous
year: losses of k € 16,743), from changes in fair values of the spot component of hedging transactions, losses of k € 5,467
(previous year: gains of k € 16,743) were recognized in the currency translation result.

47.7. Disclosures on capital management

The objectives of the capital management are the safeguarding of business operations, the creation of a solid equity base for
financing profitable growth as well as dividend payments and the capital service. Capital management consistently aims for
the Group companies to have an equity basis that corresponds to the local requirements. When implementing and checking
the Group’s capital and liquidity, legal requirements are taken into account.

Net debt, which results from current and non-current financial liabilities minus cash and cash equivalents is an important key
figure for capital management. Net debt was as follows:

in k € **Dec. 31, 2021** **Dec. 31, 2020**

Non-current financial liabilities 5,684,260 5,503,213

Current financial liabilities 334,760 148,542

**48. Related party transactions**

In the scope of the ordinary course of business Nidda German Topco GmbH and/or its consolidated companies have entered
into related party transactions. In accordance with IAS 24, “Related parties” refers to directly or indirectly controlled subsidiaries that are not consolidated due to lack of material significance, associates and joint ventures as well as affiliated
companies and persons in key positions and their close relatives. In principle, all trades were settled with related companies
and natural persons at market-rate conditions.

48.1. Transactions with related parties

Intertrust (Deutschland) GmbH provides services in the field of management in key positions, since Intertrust supplies a
managing director of Nidda German Topco GmbH and provides administrative services. The amounts for these management
and administrative services are listed in Note 49. Members of the boards of STADA Arzneimittel AG are considered as persons
in key positions of Nidda German Topco GmbH as well, and their remuneration is also summarized in the form of quantitative
disclosures under Note 49.

Share-based remuneration in the form of a share purchase plan

The main shareholders of Nidda German Topco GmbH’s most senior parent company, Nidda Topco S.à r.l., Luxembourg, have
offered a share purchase plan to selected managers of the Group, including all members of STADA’s Executive Board and some
members of its Supervisory Board (managers in key positions). Pursuant to the conditions of the offer, the managers in question
are authorized to acquire a stake in a German limited partnership (GmbH & Co KG). The limited partnership stake in the
partnership amounts to € 7.3 million and is held by managers in key positions (28%), other managers (54%) and the main
shareholders of Nidda Topco S.à r.l., Luxembourg, as well as third parties (18%). Accordingly, the partnership holds 8.0% of
ordinary shares issued of Nidda Topco S.à r.l., Luxembourg.

The purchase price of the limited partnership stake in the GmbH & Co KG is determined on each acquisition date on the basis
of the fair value of the ordinary shares of Nidda Topco S.à r.l., Luxembourg, and the additional special features of the program.
The fair value of the ordinary shares of Nidda Topco S.à r.l., Luxembourg, is determined on the basis of the discounted cash

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements 2021  |  Notes

flow valuation taking into account the expected cash flow from the investment in STADA as well as for the financing instruments issued by the Nidda Group companies. The purchase price calculation is considered to be the fair value of the limited
partnership stake in the GmbH & Co KG, but not as the granting of additional remuneration for the management. In the event
of continued employment by the company, the management will participate in the change in the fair value of the ordinary
shares of Nidda Topco S.à r.l., Luxembourg, through this investment by ultimately selling the shares together with the other
shareholders of Nidda Topco S.à r.l., Luxembourg.

Neither Nidda Topco S.à r.l., Luxembourg, nor Nidda German Topco GmbH or any other Group company is obligated to pay
any amount to the management under this program. In accordance with IFRS 2, the program is treated as a share-based
remuneration plan that does not grant any or no significant additional remuneration to managers.

48.2. Transactions with related companies

Bain Capital Investors, LLC, Wilmington, Delaware, USA, and Cinven Partnership LLP, UK, exercise direct joint control over the
indirect subsidiary Nidda Topco S.à r.l., which in turn holds controlling interest in Nidda German Topco GmbH via its subsidiary Nidda Midco S.à r.l. The direct subsidiary of Cinven Partnership LLP, UK, Cinven Capital Management (VI) General Partner
Limited, St. Peter Port, Guernsey, is the fund manager for certain entities of the Sixth Cinven Fund in the sense of an investment
management company.

**49. Remuneration of the management in key positions**

The core elements of the system applied for members of the Executive Board include non-performance related annual
remuneration that takes the tasks and performance of the member of the Executive Board into consideration along with a
component that depends on the achievement of annual performance goals (“Short-Term Incentive”, STI). In addition to the
annual performance-related remuneration, members of the Executive Board receive a long-term planned remuneration component (“Long-Term Incentive”, LTI). The individual performance-related components are limited to a maximum amount.

The remuneration system for the Supervisory Board includes an annual fixed remuneration as well as a variable component,
depending on an average performance figure from the last three years. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board receives triple
this amount and his deputy twice the amount. In addition, Supervisory Board members receive a fixed remuneration for committee activities.

For explanations on share-based remuneration in the form of a stock purchase plan for persons in key positions, we refer to

The fees for audits relate to payments for the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of Nidda German Topco GmbH
as well as for the Group audit and for the audits of the financial statements of STADA Arzneimittel AG and its German subsidiaries, each at the end of the financial year. The fees for other assurance services related to the audit of the non-financial
report of STADA Arzneimittel AG.

**51. Events after the end of the financial year**

The Russian Federation launched a military attack against Ukraine on February 24, 2022, in response to which Ukraine declared
a state of emergency and requested defense assistance from other countries. On February 27, 2022, the European Union
decided to suspend various Russian banks from the international financial communication system SWIFT. Sanctions were also
imposed on the Russian Central Bank. Furthermore, the European Union and a number of other countries, including the United
States, imposed sanctions on various Russian industrial sectors, including energy, transport, technology and the media, as well
as on various individuals close to the Russian president. For its part, the Russian Federation has responded with countermeasures. This development led to a high degree of uncertainty in the markets and in particular the exchange rate of the
Russian ruble against the US dollar and the euro is showing a high degree of volatility with a massive devaluation tendency.
Further sanctions appear possible and probable at the time this Group Management Report was prepared.

The Group has subsidiaries in both the Russian Federation and Ukraine. While the Russian subsidiaries are not directly affected
by the military conflict, this led to an interruption of the operating business at the Ukrainian subsidiaries which will continue
until further notice.

The impact of these events on the net assets, financial position and results of operations cannot be predicted at this time and
will depend to a significant extent on the duration and intensity of both the military conflict and the sanctions put in place
against the Russian Federation. There is still no threat to the company’s operations as a going concern.

Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) on the consolidated financial statements and the group management report
(Konzernlagebericht) of Nidda German Topco GmbH as of and for the financial year ended December 31, 2021. The group

## INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

To Nidda German Topco GmbH, Bad Vilbel

_Audit Opinions_

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Nidda German Topco GmbH, Bad Vilbel, and its subsidiaries (the
Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2021, and the consolidated
statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of changes in equity
and consolidated statement of cash flows for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2021 and notes to the
consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited
the group management report of Nidda German Topco GmbH, Bad Vilbel, for the financial year from January 1 to December
31, 2021.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU,
and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB and, in compliance with these
requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at December 31,
2021, and of its financial performance for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2021, and

- the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position. In all
material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with
German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development.

Pursuant to § 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal
compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.

_Basis for the Audit Opinions_

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with
§ 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the
Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements
and principles are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
and of the Group Management Report” section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance
with the requirements of German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management
report.

The executive directors are responsible for the other information.

The other information comprises the annual report – excluding cross-references to external information – with the exception
of the audited consolidated financial statements, the audited group management report and our auditor’s report.

Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other
information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.

F-110


-----

In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information mentioned above and, in so doing, to consider
whether the other information

- is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management report or our knowledge
obtained in the audit, or

- otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

_Responsibilities of the Executive Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements_
_and the Group Management Report_

The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e
Abs. 1 HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view
of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition the executive directors are
responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern.
In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an
intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.

Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole,
provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial
statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have
considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable
German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.

_Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements_
_and of the Group Management Report_

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides
an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements
and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our audit opinions on the
consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
§ 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the
Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error
and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.

F-111


-----

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the assurance engagement. We also

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of
these systems.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates
made by the executive directors and related disclosures.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and
in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or
conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that
the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial
performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German
commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB.

- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities
within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.
We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for
our audit opinions.

- Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with
German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.

- Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management
report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used
by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective
information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on
the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the
prospective information.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements  |  Notes

## NOTES

##### General Information

**1. Corporate information**

Nidda German Topco GmbH as the parent company of the Nidda Group (hereinafter referred to as “Nidda Group” or “Group”),
with business address, c/o STADA Arzneimittel AG, Stadastrasse 2–18, 61118 Bad Vilbel, is a Germany-based Company. The
operating activities comprise the management of its own assets as well as the acquisition, sale, holding and management of
investments in other companies which are active in the healthcare market both in Germany and abroad. Nidda German Topco
GmbH also provides services for Group companies particularly in the areas of Corporate HR and Corporate Finance.

The Consolidated Financial Statements of Nidda German Topco GmbH for financial year 2020 were approved for publication
by the Management Board on March 10, 2021.

**2. Basis of preparation of the financial statements**

The Consolidated Financial Statements prepared for Nidda German Topco GmbH as parent company as of December 31, 2020,
were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations published by the
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), as applicable in the European Union (EU) as well as in accordance with the supplementary provisions pursuant
to Section 315a (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB).

The financial year corresponds to the calendar year. The individual financial statements of the companies included in the scope
of consolidation are prepared as of the same date as the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The structure of the consolidated income statement follows the cost-of-sales method, according to which expenses incurred
in generating sales are divided into functional areas. In the statement of comprehensive income, use was made of the option
to present this separately from the consolidated income statement. The balance sheet classification distinguishes between
non-current and current assets and liabilities, some of which are presented in detail in the notes according to their current or
non-current distinction.

The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in euro. Unless otherwise indicated, figures in the Notes are shown in
euro thousands (k €). Rounding is thus necessary, although this of course is not significant in its nature.

**3. Consequences of new or amended standards and interpretations**

The pronouncements published by the IASB and adopted by the EU or amendments to pronouncements of the IASB with a
first-time application date of January 1, 2020 have been observed by Nidda in financial year 2020 and applied where relevant.

The Group has applied Definition of a Business (amendments to IFRS 3) to business combinations for which the acquisition
dates are on or after January 1, 2020 in order to assess whether it has acquired a company or a group of assets. In determining
whether a particular group of activities and assets is a business, the Group assesses whether the group of assets and activities
acquired includes at least one resource input and one substantive process, and whether the acquired group has the ability to
generate output.

F-120


-----

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements  |  Notes

The Group has the option to apply a “concentration test” that provides a simplified assessment of whether an acquired group
of activities and assets is not a business. The optional concentration test is met if the fair value of the gross assets acquired is
substantially concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets.

In the statement of cash flows, a change in presentation has been made whereby interest paid, taking advantage of the option
under IAS 7.33, is now shown in cash flow from financing activities and no longer within cash flow from operating activities.
Because interest paid as financing expenses results directly from the borrowings of financial liabilities, which are also included
in the cash flow from financing activities, the changed presentation leads, from STADA’s perspective, to the financial statements
providing more relevant information on the impact of these transactions on STADA’s cash flows. The comparative figures from
the previous year have been adjusted accordingly. As a result of the change in presentation, cash flow from operating activities
increased in financial year 2020 by €237.6 million; this was countered by a decrease in cash flow from financing activities. For
the previous year, this resulted in an increase in cash flow from operating activities of €175.6 million, while cash flow from
financing activities decreased accordingly due to the increased cash outflows.

The following IFRS standards, which are not yet applicable, have been published by the IASB:

From today’s perspective, no or no significant effects on the Consolidated Financial Statements are expected from the future
application of the further standards (LIBOR reform, IAS 1) and interpretations not yet applied.

**4. Changes in accounting policies**

There were no changes to accounting policies with significant consequences for the presentation of net assets, financial
position and results of operations or cash flow in financial year 2020, other than the effects already mentioned from the change
in presentation according to which interest paid, taking advantage of the option in accordance with IAS 7.33, is now reported
in cash flow from financing activities and no longer within cash flow from operating activities.

**5. Scope of consolidation**

All significant subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Subsidiaries
are companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by Nidda German Topco GmbH and are therefore fully consolidated.
Control exists if Nidda German Topco GmbH or its subsidiaries are in control of an investee, are exposed to variable backflows
and, due to control over existing rights, are able to substantially influence the investee’s variable backflows. Control is usually
substantiated by a share of voting rights of more than 50%.

Joint arrangements are characterized by joint control by two or more parties and should be classified as either joint operations
or as joint ventures. In joint operations, the parties that exercise joint control possess the rights to assets and liabilities included
in the agreement. In joint ventures, however, the parties involved possess rights to the company’s net assets. Joint ventures
are to be included in the Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method.

Associates are companies over which Nidda German Topco GmbH can have significant direct or indirect influence and are not
subsidiaries or joint ventures. They are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method.

F-121

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements  |  Notes

Subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates whose influence, both individually and as a whole, on the net assets, financial
position and results of operations of the Nidda Group is insignificant, are not consolidated or accounted for using the equity
method. Investments in these companies are accounted for at amortized cost under financial assets. Accumulated, the sales
and balance sheet total of these companies make up about 1% of total Group sales and/or the balance sheet total.

Changes in the scope of consolidation resulted regarding the number of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates included
in financial year 2020 and are as follows:

**Number of companies in the scope of consolidation** **Germany** **Outside** **Total**

**Jan. 1, 2020** **16** **70** **86**

within non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale as well as associated liabilities as of March 31, 2020. As part of
this disclosure, there was an impairment loss of €5.8 million already in the first quarter of 2020, which is included in other
expenses. The deconsolidation as of April 30, 2020 also resulted in additional expenses of €6.4 million, which were also
recognized under other expenses. In this regard, a reclassification of a €6.3 million expense from currency effects was carried
out from equity in the income statement from currency effects.

In addition, UK subsidiaries Slam Trading Limited and LAS Trading Limited were sold in the second quarter of 2020. In this
context, Lowry Solutions Limited and the non-operating companies Socialites E-Commerce Limited, Socialites Retail Limited,
Fresh Vape Electronic Cigarettes Limited were also deconsolidated. These deconsolidations, which were carried out as of
May 31, 2020, resulted in a total loss of €7.0 million, which was recognized in other expenses. In this regard, the recycling of
a €5.6 million expense from currency effects was carried out from equity in the income statement.

In the second quarter of 2020, the American subsidiary STADA Corp. was included in the scope of consolidation of STADA as

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements  |  Notes

The exemption rule in Section 264 (3) of the German Commercial Code (HGB) was applied to ALIUD PHARMA GmbH, BEPHA
investmentsgesellschaft für Pharmawerte mbH, Hemopharm GmbH, Mobilat Produktions GmbH, Natures Aid Deutschland
GmbH, STADA CEE GmbH, STADA GmbH, STADA Consumer Health Deutschland GmbH and STADAPHARM GmbH.

**6. Principles for the consolidation of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates**

According to IFRS, business combinations are to be accounted for using the acquisition method. Assets, liabilities and
con tingent liabilities from business combinations are generally recognized in full – irrespective of the amount of the shareholding – as of the acquisition date at their fair values. If the historical costs of the subsidiary acquired exceed the proportionate
newly measured net assets of the acquiree, Nidda recognizes the positive difference as goodwill. After critical examination of
the premises underlying the purchase price allocation, a negative difference is recognized through profit or loss in the period
of the acquisition. In a business combination achieved in stages, it is necessary to carry out a revaluation through profit or loss
of the shares previously held at the date control was achieved. The shares of non-controlling interests are disclosed in the
amount of their share in net assets of the subsidiary.

The acquisition of additional shares from an existing controlling position in a subsidiary is recognized through other comprehensive income in accordance with IFRS 10, because it is a transaction between the equity investors.

Subsidiaries are generally included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the acquisition date to the end of control
by the parent company. Receivables, liabilities, expenses, income and earnings between the companies included in the
Consolidated Financial Statements are eliminated, intercompany value adjustments and provisions are released. If these
consolidation measures result in deviations between the IFRS carrying amounts and the tax base of assets and liabilities,
deferred tax liabilities are recognized.

Shares in associates are recognized according to the equity method at acquisition cost on the date when joint control is established (joint ventures) or when significant influence was established (associates) and carried forward from this date in the
amount of the proportionate share of earnings in the financial year. A positive difference determined during the purchase price
allocation is recognized as goodwill in the carrying amount of the investment in the associate. A negative difference is recognized in income in the period of the acquisition in the results from associates. Profit and loss from transactions with associates
is recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements only according to the share of minority interests.

If indications arise from the application of IFRS 9 that the carrying amount determined using the equity method might be
impaired, an impairment test is carried out and, if applicable, an impairment loss in the amount of the difference between the
carrying amount and the recoverable amount is recognized. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less cost to
sell and the value in use of the shares in an associate.

**7. Currency translation**

The functional currency of Nidda German Topco GmbH is the euro and corresponds to the reporting currency of the Group.

In the separate financial statements of companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate applicable at the time of the transactions. On every
balance sheet date, monetary items are translated using the closing rate and non-monetary items are translated using the
transaction rate. Resulting currency translation differences are recognized in income as exchange gains or losses.

F-131


-----

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements  |  Notes

The translation of the companies with a functional currency other than the euro included in the Consolidated Financial
Statements into the Group functional currency is carried out using the closing rate method. Assets and liabilities are generally
translated using the closing rate, while individual components of equity are translated using the historical rates at
their respective dates of inflow from the Group’s perspective. The income and expenses of the income statements are translated – and thereby also the resulting translation of the annual results to be entered in equity – using the average exchange
rate of the period.

Currency translation differences arising from the use of different exchange rates are recognized directly in equity in the
“Provisions for currency translation”. These provisions are released and recognized in income if Group companies leave the
scope of consolidation.

The exchange rate development of currencies important to Nidda to the euro can be seen in the following chart:

**Closing rate on Dec. 31** **Average rate**
**in local currency** **for the reporting period**

**8. Business combinations**

In financial year 2020, the following significant business combinations in accordance with IFRS 3 occurred, for which the preliminary purchase price allocation is described in greater detail below.

Assumption of control over the Ukrainian Biopharma Group

As of December 20, 2019, STADA assumed control over the Ukrainian Biopharma Group, Bila Tserkva. The company markets
prescription pharmaceuticals and consumer health products. The Biopharma Group has been included as a subsidiary in the
consolidated financial statements from December 31, 2019. The purchase price for the acquisition in the amount of €49.4 million was paid entirely in cash.

First time inclusion of the Biopharma Group in the Consolidated Financial Statements of STADA Arzneimittel AG took place
as of December 31, 2019. The purchase price allocation was taken into account on a provisional basis in the Consolidated
Financial Statements as of December 31, 2019. The purchase price allocation has now been finalized and has been included
accordingly in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the 2020 financial year. The adjustments required by the finalization
also had an impact on the closing data as reported in these Consolidated Financial Statements for the comparative period of
2020. This justifies deviations from comparative figures in the consolidated financial statements for financial year 2020 with
disclosures that were included in the Consolidated Financial Statements prepared as of December 31, 2019.

The adjustments related to the finalization of the purchase price allocation as of December 31, 2019 are as follows:

**Goodwill** **4.5**

In this regard, goodwill resulted primarily from the strengthening of the global branded products portfolio and from an
expansion of the presence for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease to complement the existing APO-go[®] portfolio.

Adjustments in connection with the finalization of the purcahse price allocation as of October 1, 2020 are as follows:

**Oct. 1, 2020**
**Fair values in € million** **(fair value)**

Intangible assets 198.2

Property, plant and equipment 0.7

Deferred tax assets 0.5

Trade accounts receivable 0.3

Other receivables 0.1

Cash and cash equivalents 0.2

**Assets** **200.0**

Other non-current provisions 1.8

Trade accounts payable 0.5

Deferred tax liabilities 40.1

Other liabilities 0.1

**Liabilities** **42.4**

Intangible assets as well as property, plant and equipment were amortized as scheduled in the reporting year.

The gross value of the trade accounts receivable was €0.3 million, which were deemed fully recoverable. Trade accounts
receivable were recorded at their fair value in the amount of €0.3 million.

Sales of Lobsor Pharmaceuticals amounted to about €0.7 million in the reporting year. Earnings after taxes of this company
amounted to approximately -€3.2 million in financial year 2020.

If an acquisition of Lobsor Pharmaceuticals had already taken place on January 1, 2020, sales of around €2.5 million and
earnings after taxes of around -€5.4 million would have been included.

**9. Accounting policies**

Nidda’s Consolidated Financial Statements are based on uniform accounting policies. The basis for these are the accounting
requirements which are mandatory for all companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements and which are described
in more detail below insofar as they are significant for the Consolidated Financial Statements or for which option rights are
exercised.

**Sales are recognized when the control over delimitable goods passes to the customer, meaning that the customer is able to**
determine the use of the delimitable goods and, essentially, derive benefit from them. As a requirement for this, there must
be an agreement with enforceable rights and obligations and, inter alia, a consideration must be highly likely. The creditworthiness of the customer must be considered in this instance. The amount of sales is based on the transaction price to which
the Group is expected to be entitled. Variable considerations that are only considered if it is highly likely that this will not lead
to a significant reversal of sales should there no longer be any uncertainty regarding the variable consideration, have an
influence on the expected transaction price. The amount of the variable consideration is therefore determined using the
expected value method.

Expenses from the creation of provisions for returns are deducted from sales on the basis of estimated amounts. The estimates
are based on experience regarding amounts used in the past. The estimated expense from the creation of provisions is determined as a percentage of sales. Discounts to health insurance organizations are also recognized with a reduction on sales
based on the respective contract in force.

All license agreements are either bound to the realized sales of the licensee or further activities are necessary on the part of
STADA that would allow the use of the right by the licensee. The realization of sales is thus distributed over the periods of the
contractual term.

Income and expenses from the same transactions are generally recognized in the same period. Expenses related to accruals
for future revenue reductions are thus recorded in the period in which the sales are realized.

**Cost of sales includes the costs of conversion of the products sold and the purchase price of commercial goods sold or given**
free of charge. The expense is recognized in the period in which the associated income is realized. In addition, cost of sales
also includes costs directly attributable to the commercial goods (e.g. cost of materials and personnel expenses), overhead
costs (e.g. scheduled depreciation of production equipment and regulatory drug approvals and licenses) as well as value
adjustments of excess or obsolete inventories.

**Development costs consist of expenses involved initially in the technical implementation of theoretical discoveries in**
production and production processes and ultimately their commercial implementation.

As a rule, the objective of a development process is to obtain national or multinational regulatory drug approval. Downstream
from the development process is an evaluation process at the end of which a decision on the actual execution of a development
is made. Within the development process itself, development costs relative to approvals for new drugs result in capitalization
as intangible assets if all the following preconditions are met:

- It is technically possible to complete the asset (generally, achieve regulatory approval), enabling it to become available for
use or sale.

- The intention and ability, as well as the necessary resources, exist to complete the asset and to use (i.e. usually to market
it oneself) or sell it in the future.

- The intangible asset provides the Group with a future economic benefit.

- It is possible to reliably calculate the development costs of the intangible asset.

F-138


-----

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements  |  Notes

Development costs not eligible for capitalization as expense are immediately recognized in the periods in which they are
incurred. These include expenses for technical and regulatory maintenance of products marketed.

**Goodwill is not amortized over the period of useful life. Instead, an impairment test is performed at least once per year**
(impairment-only approach). Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units. The STADA Group is managed as a cash-generating
unit in the Nidda Group. For this reason, the impairment test of goodwill is carried out at this levell.

Nidda plans to carry out impairment tests for capitalized goodwill at least once a year. Additional reviews also take place if
indications of impairment become apparent. During the impairment test, the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit
is compared with its recoverable amount. The carrying amount of a cash-generating unit comprises the carrying amounts of
all assets and liabilities attributable to the valuation unit including the carrying amount of goodwill to be tested. If the
recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is lower than the carrying amount, an impairment loss results. The recoverable
amount is generally defined as the higher of the fair value less costs to sell, if measurable, and the value in use of the cashgenerating unit. The discounted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use, applying an individual interest rate
for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three years. For the period after this three-year detailed
planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of 50% the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed.
Significant assumptions made in order to determine the value in use include assumptions regarding sales development, regulatory conditions, investments, the discount rate, currency relations as well as the growth rate. These assumptions are made
individually according to the individual situations for every cash-generating unit and are partly based on internally determined
assumptions that both reflect past experience and include external market data.

**Other intangible assets with determinable useful lives are recognized at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over the**
period of their useful life. Amortization shall begin when the asset is available for use, i.e. when it is in the condition necessary
for it to be capable of operating in the intended manner. The useful life of regulatory drug approvals, trademarks, licenses,
dossiers with data for drug approvals or in preparation of drug approvals, software, concessions, property rights and similar
rights is between three and 30 years. Expenses from scheduled amortization of intangible assets are allocated to the relevant
functional costs and generally reported within cost of sales. If on the reporting date, there are indications that these assets
are impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is re-evaluated and impairment losses are recognized according to the
difference to the carrying amount. If the reasons for recognizing an impairment loss cease to exist, corresponding write-ups
are carried out up to a maximum of the amortized cost, insofar as the estimates for the calculation of the recoverable amount
of the asset justifies this.

Intangible assets with indeterminable useful lives are not amortized. In the context of annual impairment tests and additionally in all cases where there are indications of impairment, the recoverable amounts of these assets are compared with their
carrying amounts and if necessary, an impairment loss is recognized. For this purpose, the fair value of the asset less costs to
sell was determined using the relief from royalty method. At Nidda, this affects the capitalized umbrella brands STADA, Hemofarm and Pymepharco. Impairment tests are carried out for the umbrella brands with indefinite useful lives at the level of the
individual company or, for the umbrella brand Hemofarm, at the level of the individual companies that generate sales under
the Hemofarm umbrella brand. Intangible assets that are not yet available for use are also generally put through annual
impairment tests. Furthermore, in each reporting period, an audit is carried out to check whether the reasons for recognizing
an indefinite useful life continue to exist.

F-139

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements  |  Notes

Internal development costs are capitalized in accordance with the criteria in IAS 38. Capitalized development costs consist
mainly of costs that can be allocated to the projects, such as the costs of individuals working in development, material costs,
external services and directly allocable overhead costs. Internally created intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line
basis over their useful life (generally 20 years).

**Property, plant and equipment is reported at cost less depreciation and any impairment losses plus write-ups. Depreciation**
shall begin when the asset is available for use and is accordingly in the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating.
Subsequent acquisition costs are capitalized. Capitalization requires that a future economic benefit will flow to the company
and that the cost of the asset can be reliably measured. Expenses for repairs and maintenance that do not represent significant
replacement investments are recognized as expenses in the financial year in which they are incurred.

Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated according to their useful life using the straight-line method. The
depreciation period may be up to 50 years in the case of buildings, eight to 20 years in the case of technical facilities and three
to 14 years for other plant and office furniture and equipment. The component approach, according to which every significant
component of property, plant and equipment with different useful lives, must be depreciated separately, is not applied due to
a lack of relevance. To the extent necessary, impairment losses are recognized pursuant to IAS 36; these are reversed if the
reasons for the original recognition of an impairment loss no longer exist insofar as the estimates for the calculation of the
recoverable amount of the asset justifies this.

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or production of a qualifying asset are capitalized as part of
the cost of the intangible asset or property, plant and equipment. Other borrowing costs are not capitalized. Where acquisitions
are made in a currency other than the respective functional currency, subsequent changes in exchange rates have no impact
on the recording of original historical costs.

**Impairments on other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment exist when the recoverable amount of an asset**
is lower that its carrying amount. At each reporting date, Nidda assesses whether indications for impairment are apparent. If
this is the case, e.g. if certain defined critical values are exceeded, the asset’s recoverable amount is determined. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, where the value in use is calculated
with a discounted cash flow method. Under this procedure, future cash flows from intangible assets are discounted at the
weighted average cost of capital, which is determined individually for the two areas Generics and Branded Products with
specific parameters. Expenses arising from impairments are recognized under “Other expenses”.

For the purpose of impairment tests of other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, cash-generating units are
defined at the level of individual assets within the areas of Branded Products and Generics.

If the reasons for an impairment no longer exist, the corresponding write-ups are carried out up to a maximum of the carrying
amounts determined at amortized cost. Income from write-ups is reported under the item “Other income”.

**Inventories include such assets that are held for sale in the ordinary course of business (finished goods), that are in the process**
of production for such sale (work in progress), and that are consumed in the production process or in the rendering of services
(materials and supplies). Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Historical costs or costs of
sales are determined based on weighted average costs. Costs of sales include both costs that are directly incurred in production
and overheads that can be allocated to the production process, including reasonable depreciation on production facilities.
Financing costs are not included, but are instead recognized as an expense in the period in which they occur. Net realizable
value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated
costs necessary to make the sale.

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements  |  Notes

**Financial assets can be divided into the following categories in accordance with IFRS 9: Measurement at amortised cost (“AC”),**
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (“FVPL”) and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive
income (“FVOCI”). Financial assets are accounted for and measured in accordance with IFRS 9. This involves classifying a
financial asset on the basis of its contractual cash flow characteristics and business model. Under IFRS 9, a financial asset is
carried at cost if the underlying business model is to hold the assets in order to collect contractual cash flows (business model
condition). In addition, the cash flow condition must be satisfied. This is the case when the contractual features of the financial
asset at specified times only provide for interest and principal payments on the outstanding principal amount.

Receivables eligible for factoring are included in trade accounts receivable. Based on the present business model, they are
measured at fair value recorded directly in equity. Changes in the fair value of these receivables are therefore recognized
directly in equity in the FVOCI reserve. Financial assets measured at fair value recorded directly in equity are generally subject
to the same impairment model as financial assets measured at amortized cost.

In accordance with IFRS 9, expected losses are accounted for on the basis of the expected credit loss model. The simplified
approach is applied for trade accounts receivable. The general approach is generally applied to other financial assets.

**Trade accounts receivable are measured at amortized cost less impairments using the effective interest rate method. Impair-**
ments are made in the form of individual impairments and general individual impairments for specific defaults and expected
default risks resulting from the insolvency of customers. To quantify the expected default risk, the expected future cash flows
from receivables grouped by debtor are determined. To this end, the maturity structures of net receivables and experience
relating to derecognition of receivables in the past, the creditworthiness of the customers as well as changes in payment
conditions are taken into account. In addition, a trade credit insurance that covers part of the loss in case of default is to be
taken into consideration for various Group companies. The required impairment determined reduces the assets’ carrying
amounts through recognition of an impairment account.

The loss is recognized in profit and loss under “Other expenses”. Bad debts are derecognized against the impairment account.
Subsequent cash receipts for receivables already derecognized are presented net of expenses.

**Financial liabilities are measured on initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the**
acquisition. For financial liabilities that subsequently continue to be measured at fair value, any transaction costs are recognized
as an expense in the period in which they occur. This relates to the accounting of derivative financial instruments with negative
market values. These financial liabilities are reported in the “Other financial liabilities” item.

Fair value hedges serve to hedge against the risk of market value fluctuations. The results from the hedging instruments
are generally recognized in the items of the income statement in which the fair value change of the hedged underlying transaction is also reflected. Within the scope of fair value hedge accounting, in addition to the fair value change in the derivative,
the opposing fair value change in the underlying transaction is recognized in profit or loss, insofar as it is attributable to the
hedged risk.

No use is made of the option to designate financial liabilities on initial recognition as financial liabilities to be recognized at
fair value through profit or loss.

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements  |  Notes

**Leases in which the Group is the lessee are recognized as rights of use within non-current assets and as corresponding lease**
liabilities within other financial liabilities. Excepted from this are short-term leases with a maximum term of 12 months as well
as leases for low-value assets with a value of below €5,000. Here, Nidda applies the option to recognize such leases as expenses
at the time of the lease payment. Upon initial recognition, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the outstanding lease payments, discounted at the interest rate underlying the lease. If the interest rate underlying the lease cannot be
determined, a marginal debt rate is used. Nidda also makes use of the lease provision not to separate non-lease components
from lease components and recognizes corresponding leases as a single agreement.

**10. Estimates, assumptions and discretion in the application of accounting principles**

The presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements is
determined by recognition and valuation methods. To a certain extent, Nidda makes estimates and assumptions relating to
the future that are based on past experience as well as other factors that are considered to be appropriate in the particular
circumstances. Although the estimates and assumptions are constantly re-evaluated, estimates derived in this way may differ
from actual circumstances. The significant estimates, accounting judgments and related assumptions for the accounting issues
concerned are detailed below.

Nidda expects that the Covid-19 situation that prevailed at the time of the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements will not be a long-term situation. Accordingly, Nidda does not expect any material impact on the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Impact due to Covid-19 on the Consolidated Financial Statements, however, could occur for the following reasons:
Interest rate adjustments in various countries, increased volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, deteriorating credit
ratings, payment defaults or delays, delays in order entry and execution or modified cost structures, limited asset utilization,
volatility in the financial and commodity markets, limited or no access to customer facilities, or difficulty in making forecasts
and projections due to uncertainties in the volume and timing of cash flows. These factors may affect the fair values and
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, the amount and timing of earnings recognition as well as cash flows. It is reasonably
possible that adjustments to assumptions and carrying amounts may be necessary in financial year 2021. Nidda assumes at
the present time that the assumptions made adequately reflect the situation at the time of preparation of the consolidated
financial statements.

Furthermore, the possibly negative macroeconomic consequences in connection with the UK’s exit from the EU could also
have an impact.

The significant estimates, accounting judgments and related assumptions for the accounting issues concerned are detailed
below.

As part of purchase price allocations in business combinations, goodwill is the difference between the acquired net assets
evaluated according to IFRS 3 and the consideration transferred plus the fair value of the previously held shares and the amount
recognized of non-controlling shareholders. Various valuation methods are used for this that are primarily based on estimates
and assumptions. Insofar as contingent purchase price components are agreed, the expected future consideration is measured
as part of the acquisition and recognized as other financial liabilities. These include future milestone payments or license fees,
the probability of which is estimated at the time of the company acquisition and discounts based on the expected payment
dates in order to determine the amount of the other financial liability. In subsequent periods, this assessment is updated and
the change is recognized in profit or loss at fair value under other expenses.

F-142


-----

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements  |  Notes

Nidda carries out an impairment test for capitalized goodwill at least once a year. The discounted future cash flows of the
cash-generating units, aggregated into operating segments, which are based on certain assumptions, are to be determined
for this purpose. In this regard, both an allocation from “Corporate Assets” to the carrying amounts of the respective cashgenerating units and an allocation from “Corporate Costs” are carried out in the calculation of the respective value in use on
the basis of individual appropriate distribution keys. The discounted cash flow method is used to determine the value in use,
applying an individual interest rate for each cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three years based on
approved budgets. Due to current market developments in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic, a moderate earnings
discount was applied to planning in order to adequately reflect current market uncertainties. Accordingly, the interest rate
determined on the cash-generating units includes the market parameters influenced by the Covid-19 pandemic. For the period
after this three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of 50% of the expected longterm inflation rate is assumed. The budget values for future financial years, which are subject to some uncertainty due to
unforeseeable future legal developments and developments in the health care market, as well as the parameters determined
in the context of current market information but also as a best possible estimate mean that the assessment of impairment
may differ from actual circumstances, and despite good forecasts in the reporting year an impairment requirement may be
necessary in subsequent years.

For items of property plant and equipment and intangible assets, the expected useful lives and associated amortization or
depreciation expenses are determined on the basis of the expectations and assessments of management. If the actual useful
life is less than the expected useful life, the amount of depreciation or amortization is adjusted accordingly. As part of the
determination of impairment losses on fixed assets, estimates relating to the cause, timing and amount of the impairments
are also made. Particularly in the context of impairment tests for yet unused approvals, which are reported as advance payments,
the growth rates applied for the present value test as well as the long-term price and cost development of active pharmaceutical ingredients are based on best possible estimates. This also applies to the impairment tests of other intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives.

Development costs are capitalized based on the assessment of whether the capitalization requirements of IAS 38 are met.
Planning calculations are necessary to determine the future economic benefit, which are by their nature subject to estimates
and may therefore deviate from actual circumstances in the future.

Nidda makes valuation allowances on receivables in order to anticipate losses expected in relation to the insolvency of
customers. The maturity structure of the net receivables and past experience in relation to bad debts as well as the customers’
creditworthiness are used as the criteria for evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation allowances. This does not, however,
exclude the possibility that the actual derecognitions will exceed the expected valuation allowances due to a significant
worsening in the financial position of the customer. Accounting judgments and estimates regarding the assessment of the
value of receivables relate particularly to impaired receivables from debtors in CEE countries.

The Group operates in various countries and must pay respective income taxes in each tax jurisdiction. In order to calculate
the income tax provisions and the deferred taxes in the Group, the expected income tax as well as the temporary differences
resulting from the different treatment of certain items according to IFRS and their accounting in accordance with tax law are
each to be determined on the basis of assumptions. If the final taxation imposed deviates from the assumed values, this has
a corresponding effect on actual and deferred taxes and thus on the business, financial and earnings situation of the Group in
the respective period. Furthermore, increasing importance within the Nidda Group is being allotted to a comprehensive
tax transfer-pricing model for the payment of intercompany services. Potential risks of non-recognition of these transfer
prices for tax purposes is limited by way of the introduction of corresponding agreement procedures and a comprehensive
definition of transfer prices in the form of a Group guideline. If it is probable that amounts recognized in the tax returns cannot
be realized, tax liabilities are recognized which are measured at the most probable amount or the expected value.

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements  |  Notes

When determining the fair values of derivatives and other financial instruments, for which no market price in an active market
is available, valuation models based on input parameters observable in the market are applied. The cash flows, which are
already fixed or calculated by means of the current yield curve using so-called “forward rates”, are discounted to the measurement date with the discount factors determined by means of the yield curve valid on the reporting date.

The amount of pension obligations from defined benefit plans is calculated using actuarial methods. This procedure is based
upon assumptions, among other things, regarding the discount rate, life expectancy and future salary and pension increases.
Changes to these assumptions can significantly influence the amount of future pension costs. For German Group companies,
pension obligations are calculated based on the biometric accounting principles of the Heubeck 2018G mortality tables.
Outside Germany, country-specific mortality tables are used. Future pension benefits are subject to individual pension agreements. The discount rate shall be based on long-term rates of return on high quality corporate bonds with fixed interest rates
at the reporting date. In countries where there is no liquid market in such corporate bonds, the discount rate is determined
on the basis of market yields on government bonds.

The creation of other provisions is based on the assessment of management regarding the probability and amount of an outflow of resources. Provisions are created if there is a present external obligation and a probable outflow of resources, i.e. if it
is more likely to occur than not. Provisions in relation to pending legal disputes are created based on estimates of the prospects
of success of these methods. The determination of provisions for damages is also associated with substantial estimates and
can change due to new information. The same applies for the recognition of the amount of contingent liabilities.

Expenses from the creation of provisions for warranties are considered in sales and charged against income. Estimated values
based on past experience are used for this purpose. This means that the actual expenses for returns may differ from the
estimate and sales would accordingly turn out to be higher or lower. The same applies for the consideration of discounts
(e.g. discounts to health insurance organizations) prescribed by law and due to other regulatory requirements. These are
recognized with a reduction on sales based on the respective underlying contract with an estimated amount in expectation
of probable sales.

##### Notes to the Consolidated Income Statement

**11. Sales**

Sales are generated exclusively in the STADA (sub) Group and are based primarily on the supply of products and, to a lesser
extent, on license revenues. For information on the reporting of sales, please refer to the details included in Accounting Policies.

In financial year 2020, achieved sales were €3,010.3 million (previous year: €2,608.6 million).

The increase in sales in financial year 2020 was based for the most part on the acquisitions made as well as good sales development in the German, Belgian and French generics market as well as in the Russian and British branded products segment.
Development in the German branded products segment market had an opposing effect. Portfolio changes impacted sales by
€315.4 million as an adjustment for the reporting year and by €8.6 million as an adjustment for the previous year, while
exchange rate-related effects reduced sales in the previous year by €45.6 million.

**12. Cost of sales**

Cost of sales is divided into the following items:

in k € **2020** **2019**

Material expenses 1,144,637 966,949

Impairment, depreciation and amortization 346,778 301,343

Expenses from inventory write-downs 69,717 40,914

Remaining cost of sales 125,257 108,159

**Total** **1,686,389** **1,417,364**

Impairment, depreciation and amortization in the amount of €346.8 million (previous year: €301.3 million) mainly included
amortization on intangible assets, the ownership of which represents a necessary condition for the marketing of the products
manufactured – in particular drug approvals.

Expenses from inventory write-downs included inventories written down to net realizable value netted with reversals. Reversals
amounted to €7.6 million (previous year: €11.9 million) in financial year 2020.

**13. Selling expenses**

In addition to the costs for sales departments and the sales force, selling expenses also comprise costs for advertising and
marketing activities including samples for doctors. They also include all costs for logistics that occur for completed final
products. Discounts in the form of free retail packages, so-called discounts in kind – if possible under the legal regulations in
a national market – are not included. The resulting expenses are reported as a part of cost of sales.

In the reporting year, marketing costs of €301.1 million (previous year: €265.3 million) corresponded to a share of 46% in
selling expenses (previous year: 46%). In addition, selling expenses included depreciation in the amount of €19.1 million
(previous year: €17.0 million).

**14. General and administrative expenses**

Personnel and material costs of service and administrative units are reported under general and administrative expenses,
unless they have been charged to other functional areas as internal services.

In 2020, the general and administrative expenses included depreciation in the amount of €17.0 million (previous year:
€15.8 million).

General and administrative expenses increased in the reporting year by €248.9 million (previous year: €230.1 million). This
increase resulted, among other things, from the acquisitions made. The share of general and administrative expenses in Group
sales was 8.3% (previous year: 8.8%).

**15. Research and development expenses**

For information on the composition of research and development expenses, please refer to the details included in Accounting
Policies.

In financial year 2020, research and development expenses increased by €12.1 million compared to the previous year.
The research and development expenses included depreciation in the amount of €4.5 million (previous year: €4.4 million).
Development costs for new products in the amount of €18.4 million (previous year: €20.4 million) were capitalized in financial
year 2020.

**16. Other income**

Other income is divided into the following items:

in k € **2020** **2019**

Income from the reversal of impairments on receivables 8,806 10,237

Income from the disposal of non-current assets 1,947 2,600

Income from insurance compensation 154 72

Income from write-ups 5,282 –

Remaining other income 16,162 21,339

**Total** **32,351** **34,248**

In the financial year, impairments on receivables in the amount of €8.8 million were reversed (previous year: €10.2 million).

Income from write-ups of €5.3 million in financial year 2020 related to branded products. The write-ups relate to drug approvals and trademarks, the scheduled amortization of which is recognized in cost of sales.

The remaining other income includes, for the most part, compensation claims and other income not directly associated with
functional costs, which comprises many insignificant individual items in the Group companies.

Other expenses include impairment losses of €73.5 million (previous year: €101.8 million) that only concern
impairment losses on non-current assets excluding goodwill in the reporting year. These impairment losses mainly relate to
intangible assets. The impairment losses relate to various pharmaceutical approvals and trademarks, the scheduled
amortization of which is reported within cost of sales. The impairments are primarily attributable to two approvals in the
Branded Products segment (€13.8 million and €9.0 million) due to negative future business prospects as well as a
project under development in the Generics segment (€17.4 million and €9.6 million) due to the discontinuation of
development activities. In the previous year, there was a significant impairment of two approvals in branded products
(€31.2 million and €24.8 million) due to negative future business prospects as well as a project under development in the
Generics segment (€17.0 million) as a result of the halting of development activities.

In other expenses, in the reporting year expenses from impairments on receivables in the amount of €2.4 million (previous
year: €1.5 million) were recognized.

In addition, other expenses in the reporting year also included net currency translation expenses in the amount of €50.4 million (previous year: €24.9 million) which are made up of currency translation income of €77.3 million (previous year: €28.4 million) and currency exchange expenses of €127.7 million (previous year: €53.3 million). This development was based on adverse
developments in the significant currencies in various national currencies. In particular, there were increased expenses in the
reporting year due to the devaluation of the Russian ruble for liabilities in the transaction currency euro.

Losses from the disposal of non-current assets amounted to €14.0 million (previous year: €1.7 million) and mainly include
effects from the deconsolidation of the Argentinian subsidiary Laboratorio Vannier S.A. as well as the British subsidiaries Slam
Trading Limited and LAS Trading Limited.

Additionally, remaining other expenses included personnel expenses in the amount of €30.7 million (previous year: €26.2 million), which in the reporting year resulted primarily from expenses resulting from changes in management (previous year:
severance payments for a BPO restructuring program and and expenses resulting from changes in management). The regular
personnel expenses are appropriately allocated to the respective specialist departments. Primarily, the severance payments
affected employees whose regular personnel costs were recorded under administrative costs.

Expenses for legal disputes in the amount of €45.8 million (previous year: €5.6 million) primarily related to provisions created
for damages in Germany as well as in the CIS region.

**18. Financial result**

The result from investments measured at equity in financial year 2020 was related to the companies SAS SANTRALIA (formerly Pharm Ortho Pedic SAS), AELIA SAS, Dialogfarma LLC as well as PharmTechService LLC which are accounted for using
the equity method.

**Investment income primarily relates to profit distributions from companies not included in the Consolidated Financial**
Statements.

**Financial income and financial expenses are composed of the interest result and other financial income and other financial**
expenses.

The interest result developed as follows:

in k € **2020** **2019**

Interest income 7,640 10,954

Interest expense 273,207 264,345

**Interest result** **265,567** **253,391**

thereof from financial instruments of the valuation categories in accordance with IFRS 9:

 - loans and receivables (AC) 1,953 1,339

 - financial assets and liabilities at fair value through OCI (FVOCI) -1,236 -1,541

 - financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss (FVPL) -5,690 -4,843

 - financial liabilities measured at amortized costs (AC) -259,969 -249,753

The interest result in financial year 2020 included a net interest expense from other non-current provisions, which comprises
interest income on plan assets as well as interest expenses from pension obligations and other non-current pro visions, in the
amount of €0.6 million (previous year: €0.8 million).

Also included in the interest result are interest expenses related to leases in accordance with IFRS 16 in the amount of €3.9 million (previous year: €3.3 million).

In financial year 2020, the Group financed itself at interest rates of between 0.85% p.a. and 10.19% p.a. (previous year: between
1.01% p.a. and 69.15% p.a.) whereby the high interest rate in the previous year is attributable to the taking of loans in Argentina, the carrying amounts of which are, overall, not material for the Group. As of the balance sheet date December 31, 2020,
the weighted average interest rate for non-current financial liabilities was approximately 4.00% p.a. (December 31, 2019:
approximately 3.90% p.a.). As of the balance sheet date, the weighted average interest rate for current financial liabilities was
approximately 4.27% p.a. (December 31, 2019: approximately 8.00% p.a.). The weighted average interest rate for all of the
Group’s financial liabilities was approximately 4.01% p.a. (December 31, 2019: 3.94% p.a.).

Borrowing costs capitalized as part of the cost of qualifying assets amounted to €4.2 million (previous year: €3.7 million) in
financial year 2020. A capitalization rate of 3.17% (previous year: 3.0%) for intangible assets was taken as a basis.

The following overview explains how the effective income tax expense reported in the income statement was derived from
the expected income tax expense. The expected income tax expense is calculated by applying the nominal tax rate of Nidda
German Topco GmbH to earnings before taxes. The tax effects of the respective tax rates to be applied locally depending on
their applicable national and legal forms are reported in a separate reconciliation.

**Income tax income (prior year: expense) shown on the income statement** **7,959** **-13,067**

Effective income tax rate n/a 11.0%

The nominal income tax rate for the 2020 financial year for Nidda German Topco GmbH in Germany was 28.3%, whereby this
includes corporate income tax at a rate of 15.0% and the solidarity surcharge of 5.5% on corporate income tax as well as trade
tax on income at an assessment rate of 357%.

The tax effects from loss carryforwards/interest carryforwards and prior-year taxes mainly resulted from unrecognized deferred
tax assets on tax losses and interest carried forward due to non-deductible interest expenses (so-called interest barrier rule)
in Germany as well as the adjustment of tax liabilities for previous years.

The tax effects from non-deductible expenses mainly result from (partial) additions for generally deductible financing expenses.
The other tax effects resulted mainly from effects of the STADA (sub) Group.

The actual income taxes and deferred taxes recognized in the balance sheet were as follows:

**Deferred taxes as per balance sheet** **50,591** **38,483** **919,155** **927,786**

Deferred tax liabilities reported resulted mainly from deferred taxes in the context of business combinations under IFRS 3.
The reduction in deferred tax liabilities from intangible assets compared with the previous year was primarily a result of
scheduled amortization of intangible assets with purchase price allocations measured in accordance with IFRS 3, as well as
from impairments on such assets. These were partially compensated by an increase in deferred tax assets from intangible
assets as part of the company acquisitions of Walmark and Lobsor for which the valuation of assets at fair value led to an
increase in the carrying amount and thus to an increased temporary difference. In total, deferred tax liabilities decreased to
€919.2 million as of December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019: €927.8 million). This development was mainly attributable to
the previously described reduction in temporary differences from intangible assets and lower taxable differences from liabilities.
The reduction in loss carryforwards resulted in particular from the utilization of tax loss carryforwards and the deconsolidation
of Laboratorio Vannier..

Tax advantages that are expected from the future utilization of tax loss carryforwards are reported under “Deferred taxes from
loss carryforwards”, insofar as their utilization is probable. Tax loss carryforwards capitalized as of the balance sheet date
December 31, 2020 amounted to €64.1 million in financial year 2020 (previous year: €57.9 million).

**21. Number of employees and personnel expenses**

The average number of employees at Nidda by functional area and functional sub-area was as follows:

**2020** **2019**

Marketing/Sales 3,944 3,294

Technical Operations (Production/Quality Assurance/Logistics/Procurement/Supply Chain) 6,613 5,489

**Entire Group** **12,326** **10,631**

**Personnel expenses (in € million)** **483.5** **421.2**

The average number of employees increased in the reporting year by 16% to 12,326 (previous year: 10,631). The increase
was mainly based on the first-time consolidation of the Biopharma Group as of December 31, 2019, with approximately
290 employees, the first-time consolidation of the acquired Walmark Group in March 2020 with approximately 520 employees
and the acquisition of the Takeda portfolio including the takeover of approximately 420 employees also in March 2020. In
addition, a legal change in Serbia in April 2020 resulted in the internalization of approximately 360 external employees. As of
the reporting date, the number of employees in the Group in 2020 rose by 11% to 12,339 (previous year: 11,121). The increase
was largely due to the previously mentioned acquisitions of the Walmark group and the Takeda portfolio, as well as the takeover of the external employees in Serbia.

Personnel expenses, which are included in expenses of the individual functional areas according to their functional relevance,
in financial year 2020 were €483.5 million (previous year: €421.2 million).

Additions from business combinations in accordance with IFRS 3 resulted from the acquisition of the Walmark Group, the
Takeda product portfolio as well as the acquisition of Lobsor Pharmaceuticals in the reporting year.

the product portfolio from the Swiss Optipharm AG as well as the Ukranian Orasept product portfolio.

The impairment losses mainly relate to two approvals in Branded Products (€13.8 million and €9.0 million, respectively) due
to negative future business prospects as well as two projects under development in Generics (€17.4 million and €9.6 million,
respectively) due to the discontinuation of development activities. In the previous year, there was a significant impairment

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements  |  Notes

on two approvals in Branded Products (€31.2 million and €24.8 million, respectively) due to negative future business prospects
as well as one project under development in Generics (€17.0 million) due to the discontinuation of development activities.

In the Group, the umbrella brands STADA, Hemofarm, Pymepharco are included as recognized trademarks as intangible assets
with an indefinite useful life, as it is intended to make continuing use of them.

As of December 31, 2020, the STADA umbrella brand has a carrying amount of €51.6 million (previous year: €51.6 million).
In the context of the impairment test of December 31, 2020, a royalty rate of 1.5%, as in the previous year, and a discount
rate of 5.4% (previous year: 7.4%) were used. There was no impairment need in the reporting year.

As of December 31, 2020, the Hemofarm umbrella brand has a carrying amount of €39.7 million (previous year: €39.7 million).
In the context of the impairment test of December 31, 2020, a royalty rate of 2%, as in the previous year, and a discount rate
of 9.3% (previous year: 12.9%) were used. There was no necessity for impairment for the reporting year.

As of December 31, 2020, the Pymepharco umbrella brand has a carrying amount of €8.3 million (previous year: €9.2 million).
In the context of the impairment test of December 31, 2020, a royalty rate of 2%, as in the previous year, and a discount rate
of 10.2% (previous year: 13.7%) were used. There was no necessity for impairment for the reporting year. The change is a
result of different exchange rates.

The Laboratorio Vannier umbrella brand with an indefinite useful life, which was capitalized in the previous year but fully
written off, was sold in the financial year as part of the sale of the company.

The umbrella brand Nizhpharm with a carrying amount of €10.0 million (previous year: €14.3 million) as of December 31,
2020, will be amortized as scheduled over its useful life. In addition, the carrying amount decreased in the current financial
year as a result of the exchange rate development of the Russian ruble.

Borrowing costs capitalized in 2020 for intangible assets and directly attributable to the acquisition or the production of a
qualifying asset amounted to €4.2 million (previous year: €3.7 million). In financial year 2020, the capitalization rate taken as
a basis for determining borrowing costs eligible for capitalization was 3.2% (previous year: 3.0%).

Development costs of €23.1 million were capitalized in the reporting year (previous year: €25.0 million). Capitalized development costs consist mainly of costs that can be allocated to the projects, such as the costs of individuals working in development, material costs and external services, together with directly allocatable overhead costs. Internally created intangible
assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life (generally 20 years). Development costs that do not qualify
for capitalization are recognized immediately as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. In financial year 2020,
these development costs amounted to of €84.9 million (previous year: €72.8 million).

Scheduled amortization on intangible assets mainly relates to regulatory drug approvals as well as trademarks and is recognized
in the income statement primarily under cost of sales. In the reporting year, this related to an amount of €321.2 million
(previous year: €278.9 million).

In financial year 2020, impairments on intangible assets were recognized in the total amount of €67.6 million (previous year:
€101.2 million). No valuation allowances on goodwill were recorded in the reporting year.

Details on changes in the scope of consolidation can be found in the Notes on the scope of consolidation (see Note 5.).

In the context of the takeover of STADA Arzneimittel AG, goodwill was recognized. The STADA Group is managed as a cashgenerating unit in the Nidda Group, for this reason the goodwill impairment test is carried out at this level. The increase
in goodwill in 2020 relates to the acquisition of the Walmark Group, the Takeda product portfolio as well as Lobsor Pharmaceuticals.

in € million **Dec. 31, 2020** **Dec. 31, 2019**

Residual carrying amount goodwill 566.9 539.2

As part of the regular impairment test for capitalized goodwill as of November 30, 2020, the expected cash outflow was
determined based on the discounted cash flow procedure using the following defined parameters:

in %

Growth in the 2020 update phase 1.2%

WACC 2020 10.0%

In the previous year, the parameters that were applied as of December 31, 2019 were as follows:

in %

Growth in the 2019 update phase 1.2%

WACC 2019 11.9%

The discounted cash flow method is used to determine value in use of the cash-generating units, applying an individual interest rate for the cash-generating unit and a detailed planning period of three years. Such a detailed planning period reflects
the assumptions of short to medium-term market developments. For the period after this three-year detailed planning horizon,
a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of 50% the expected long-term inflation rate is assumed. In the previous year,
for the period after the three-year detailed planning horizon, a specific estimated growth rate in the amount of the expected
long-term inflation rate is assumed. The detailed planning period for determining values in use is based on certain assumptions
that are based on past experience, complemented by internal developments, and verified based on external market data and
analyses. Key assumptions include the development of future selling prices or quantities, costs, the influence of the regulatory
market environment, investments, market share, foreign exchange rates, and growth rates. As a result of current market
developments in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic, a moderate earnings discount on the intended planning was undertaken in order to appropriately reflect current market uncertainty. The interest rate calculated on the cash-generating units
includes the market parameters influenced by the Covid-19 pandemic accordingly. Significant changes to the aforementioned

F-158

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements  |  Notes

assumptions would influence the determination of the values in use of the cash-generating units. The discount rates used
are determined based on external factors derived from the market and are adjusted for the risks predominant in the cashgenerating units in question.

There was a headroom in the upper triple-digit million range for the regular impairment test. Changes in the calculation
parameters used for the impairment tests may influence the fair values of cash-generating units. A sensitivity analysis was
therefore carried out for the cash-generating units with a 1.0 percentage points higher discount rate, a decrease in the growth
rate of 0.5 percentage points and a decrease in EBIT of 10.0 percentage points. Based on these assumptions, there was a need
for impairment in the amount of:

**Sensitivity analysis – impact on the need for impairment** **WACC** **Growth rates** **EBIT**
in € million **+1.0 percentage points** **-0.5 percentage points** **-10.0 percentage points**

Nidda 264.8 – 56.0

The following development in the respective valuation parameter would mean that the value in use of the cash-generating
unit would be equal to its carrying amount:

in % **WACC** **Growth rates** **EBIT**

Change in the parameter +0.7% -0.8% -9.3%

In the previous year, the use of assumptions for the sensitivity analysis (1.0 percentage point higher discount rate, 0.5 percentage point reduction in the growth rate and 10.0 percentage point reduction in EBIT) did not result in any impairment
requirement.

The change in fair value (FVOCI) results from the exercising of the option in accordance with IFRS 9 to recognize changes in
the fair value of equity instruments in other comprehensive income. In the reporting year, as was the case in the previous year,
this related to the investment in XBrane Biopharma AB.

The decline in investments measured at equity in financial year 2020 resulted primarily from currency translation effects and
from the dividend distribution of SAS SANTRALIA, formerly Pharm Ortho Pedic SAS.

In the previous year, the decline in investments measured at equity resulted primarily from the reclassification of shares held
by STADA in Stellapharm J.V. (formerly STADA Vietnam J.V.) into non-current assets held for sale (IFRS 5). Interest rate effects
in the previous year exclusively related to Stellapharm J.V. as the equity carrying amount of the company Stellapharm J.V.
corresponded to the contractually agreed selling price as for the shares held by STADA for the sale as of December 31, 2019,
taking into account a corresponding discounting effect. Dividend distributions essentially included the dividends paid by
Stellapharm J.V. for financial year 2019, which represented partial payments in connection with the agreement concluded in
the fourth quarter of 2017 to sell the shares in this company held by STADA.

**27. Trade accounts receivable**

Trade accounts receivable are composed as follows:

in k € **Dec. 31, 2020** **Dec. 31, 2019**

Trade accounts receivable from third parties 773,862 707,302

Trade accounts receivable from non-consolidated companies 1,783 1,791

Valuation allowances vis-à-vis third parties -105,374 -108,849

Financial assets (FVOCI) 24,500 14,850

**Total** **694,771** **615,094**

Collateral exists for a portion of trade accounts receivable the value of which was not impaired in the form of bank or corporate
guarantees or pledged inventories. Furthermore, there is commercial credit insurance for certain markets and customers. These
are taken into account in the calculation of the default risk.

The regulations on the classification of financial assets led, for factoring- capable receivables on the basis of the present business model, to the fact that these financial assets, which continue to be included in trade accounts receivable, are measured
at fair value within the scope of IFRS 9. Changes in the fair value of these receivables are recognized directly in equity in the
FVOCI reserve. In this context, financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are generally
subject to the same impairment model as financial assets measured at amortized cost.

For trade accounts receivable, an expected default on receivables is calculated over their terms on the basis of a portfoliospecific default rate. The default rate indicates the probability that a debtor will default within a period of one year. The default
rates consider the industry risks and the economic environment of the respective country. Each cluster is allocated to a
different bandwidth of expected default rates.

**28. Return Assets**

As of December 31, 2020, return assets due after one year amounted to €0.8 million (previous year: €0.7 million). The return
assets relate to expected returns in connection with agreements with customers for which reutilization is expected.

**31. Inventories**

Inventories can be subdivided as follows:

in k € **2020** **2019**

Materials and supplies 159,706 155,758

Work in progress 49,557 50,558

Advance payments to suppliers 34,344 13,818

**Total** **830,132** **638,673**

In financial year 2020, impairments netted with reversals were made on the net realizable value of inventories in the amount
of €69.7 million (previous year: €40.9 million), which were already deducted from the amounts shown above through profit
and loss. The write-ups in this regard amounted to €7.6 million (previous year: €11.9 million).

**32. Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and call deposits as well as current and highly liquid financial investments
with a maximum term of 90 days from the purchase date. In certain countries, specific transactions are subject to special
monitoring in the context of the requirements of the respective national bank or foreign exchange acts in force. Restrictions
on the availability of cash and cash equivalents amounted to €4.0 million (previous year: €5.0 million) and related exclusively
to cash in China.

Development of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020 at €278.5 million (previous year: €207.4 million) resulted
from the effects described as part of the explanations in the consolidated cash flow statement. Further details on the development of cash and cash equivalents can be found in the consolidated cash flow statement.

**33. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale as well as associated liabilities**

As of December 31, 2020, there were no assets held for sale in the STADA Group (previous year: €3.1 million).

In the second quarter of 2020, the Argentinian subsidiary Laboratorio Vannier S.A., which had already been classified as held
for sale as of March 31, 2020 in accordance with IFRS 5, was sold. The assets and liabilities of the company were presented
within non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale as well as associated liabilities as of March 31, 2020. As part of
this presentation, there was already an impairment loss of €5.8 million in the first quarter of 2020, which is included in other
expenses. The deconsolidation as of April 30, 2020 also resulted in an additional expense of €6.4 million, which was also
recognized in other expenses.

**34. Equity**

Group equity amounted to €250.3 million as of the balance sheet date (previous year: €723.9 million). This corresponds to
an equity ratio of 3.1% (previous year: 9.6%).

34.1. Share capital and capital reserve

Share capital amounted to €25,000 as of December 31, 2020 (previous year: €25,000) and was fully paid-up.

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements  |  Notes

Changes in the capital reserve of the Group are shown in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. The reduction in
the capital reserve in financial year 2020 is mainly in connection with payments for the acquisition of outstanding STADA
shares. In addition, an amount of €3.4 million from the free capital reserve was distributed to Nidda Midco S.à r.l. bx Nidda
German Topco GmbH.

In financial year 2019, there was a voluntary contribution to the capital reserve of Nidda German Topco GmbH, consisting of
the contribution and assignment of the claim to repayment of the loan amount with the shareholder Nidda Midco S.à r.l.,
Luxembourg, in the amount of €1,066.8 million and the assignment of the associated claim to interest payment in the amount
of €51.1 million. As a result, the capital reserve increased by a total of €1,117.9 million.

34.2. Retained earnings including net result

Retained earnings including net result comprise the net result for financial year 2020 as well as income generated in earlier
periods, insofar as there were not distributed, including amounts transferred to retained earnings. In addition, revaluations of
net debt from defined benefit plans that were recognized through other comprehensive income are reported under this item,
taking deferred taxes into account.

In the context of measuring the defined benefit obligations as of December 31, 2020, the net expense in the amount of
€2.8 million – not considering amounts attributable to non-controlling interests – resulted from the remeasurement (previous
year: income in the amount of €4.9 million) after deferred taxes. In addition, this position also includes currency translation
differences related to the revaluation of net debt recognized in equity from performance-oriented pension plans as well as the
deferred taxes they incur which, in financial year 2020, amounted to income recognized in equity of €0.2 million (previous
year: expense in the amount of €0.1 million).

In financial year 2020, development of retained earnings was also significantly impacted by the increase in shares in the
Vietnamese subsidiary Pymepharco Joint Stock Company. The difference between the amount by which the non-controlling
interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration must be recognized in equity in accordance with IFRS 10 and
allocated to the owners of the parent company. The resulting decrease in retained earnings amounts to €40.8 million.

34.3. Other reserves

Other reserves include results recognized directly in equity. These relate, among other things, to foreign exchange gains and
losses resulting from currency translation with no effect on income of financial statements of companies included in the Group,
which are reported in the statement of changes in equity under the currency translation reserve.

Due to the application of the new standard IFRS 9, other reserves additionally include the reserve FVOCI. Under this item, fair
value changes of the fair value receivables recognized through other comprehensive income as well as equity instruments
accounted for at fair value are accounted for without impact on profit or loss.

The decrease in other reserves in the reporting year resulted in particular from the depreciation of the Russian ruble and the
British pound since December 31, 2019, which led to expenses from foreign currency translation of the companies reporting
in this currency.

By contrast, the sale of UK company Slam as well as the Argentinian company Vannier led to an increase of €11.9 million from
the disposal of the relevant reserves.

34.4. Shares relating to non-controlling shareholders

Shares relating to non-controlling interests as of December 31, 2020 related to the minority interests of other shareholders
in the subsidiaries BIOCEUTICALS Arzneimittel AG, Hemofarm Banja Luka, Hemomont, NorBiTec GmbH, Pymepharco and
STADA Pharmaceuticals (Beijing).

In Germany, the Group has plan assets in the form of reinsurance policies, which are used to serve the pension entitlements
of a small number of former employees. In addition, there are plan assets for a pension obligation which was outsourced to a
pension fund. All further pension entitlements are financed internally in the scope of pension provisions. In addition, there
are plan assets in a few foreign subsidiaries in the form of, among other things, insurances, government bonds and securities
funds.

In financial year 2020, plan assets at the subsidiaries did not exceed their pension obligations, with the result that for
the current financial year, as was the case in the previous year, there was no excess under other assets as assets from overfunded
pension plans.

Gains from plan assets amounted in financial year 2020 to an expense of €11.7 million (previous year: gain of €6.3 million)
for German Group companies and a gain of €4.2 million (previous year: gain of €10.6 million) for foreign Group companies.

The amount of the negative income from plan assets for German Group companies is largely determined by raising the value
of the plan assets of a commitment to the value of the gross obligation on the basis of the reinsurance available for this purpose; this decreased significantly due to the discontinuation of an entitlement to surviving dependents’ benefits in the case
of a current pension commitment and thus had a negative effect on the return on plan assets. The return on plan assets outside
Germany is mainly attributable to a positive performance of plan assets in the United Kingdom and Switzerland.

The following actuarial parameters were used as a basis for measuring the German pension obligations and pension costs:

A sensitivity analysis was performed, whereby only one assumption was changed in each case and all other assumptions
remained unchanged. The following shows the change in the defined benefit obligation (DBO) for the German Group companies

The salary trend is largely insignificant because all active plan participants are close to reaching the scheduled retirement age.

In the following, the change in defined benefit obligations (DBO) for international Group companies is presented according
to a change in the discount rate, salary trends and pension trends:

As of December 31, 2020, the weighted duration of pension obligations amounted to 12 years (previous year: 20 years) for
German Group companies and 18 years (previous year: 18 years) for international Group companies.

The reduction in duration for German Group companies is based on the elimination of an entitlement to surviving dependents’
benefits in the case of a current pension commitment.

benefit plans:

For the coming financial year, employer contributions, consisting of direct pension payments and contributions to plan assets,
are expected in the amount of €0.8 million for German Group companies and €5.1 million for international Group companies.

The regulations of IAS 19 require a presentation of the benefit plans that generate obligations for the company. For the STADA
Group, pension plans in Germany, the United Kingdom and Switzerland account for the largest share of total obligations with
80%. Accordingly, the following details focus more on these countries.

In Germany, the legal framework for company pension plans is provided by the Company Pensions Act (Betriebsrentengesetz
– BetrAVG) in which minimum legal requirements are applied to company pension plans. Furthermore, regulation and legal
precedents within labor law must also be followed. The retirement benefit plans are predominantly based upon the final salary
and are concluded with newly hired employees. Plan participants are primarily beneficiaries. Benefits are paid out in the form
of a pension. In the calculation of the amount of the pension obligations, the Heubeck 2018G mortality tables were used as
a basis for consideration of mortality and fluctuation. In addition, there is a pre-retirement regulation for selected employees.

In Germany, the Group has plan assets in the form of reinsurance policies and in the form of assets in a pension fund. As of
December 31, 2020, plan assets amounted to €33.4 million and were composed of three different plans. There were no plan
assets for two additional plans.

In the context of risk assessment, the life expectancy of plan participants plays a smaller role in Germany, as the material
obligation regarding its amount and including associated risks was outsourced externally. Furthermore, there is also the common risk of the interest rate development.

The pension commitment for the former Chairman of the Executive Board of STADA Arzneimittel AG Hartmut Retzlaff was
transferred to a pension fund in full in financial year 2014. Despite the transfer, the necessity remains, due to the secondary
liability of STADA, to treat the benefit plan as a defined benefit plan in accordance with IAS 19 and measure and recognize it
accordingly in the balance sheet. The existing plan assets lead to a provision of zero due to offsetting that must be carried out
at the time of the plan amendment for this benefit plan. Because the pension commitment is fully funded, no further provisions
are expected in the future.

In the United Kingdom, STADA grants its employees defined benefit plans that are concluded for new hires. The employees
can also no longer earn an additional increase in their entitlements. The pension plans are subject to the United Kingdom Trust
Law and the United Kingdom Pension Regulator. The pension plans are monitored by trustees who determine the investment
strategy. The trustees are also responsible for fulfilling the legally required pension plan funding and thereby ensuring sufficient
assets to cover the technical provisions of the plan. The pension plan is subject to risks relating to the discount rate and
participant life expectancy as well as inflation risk, if these values develop contrary to expectations. If the discount rate is low,
the level of funding decreases, which may require the payment of additional contributions. There is a financing risk in plan
assets in that plan assets could develop contrary to expectations and plan assets could therefore only compensate in part for
changes in the obligations.

As of December 31, 2020, plan assets amounted to €27.7 million. All assets have quoted market prices on an active market.
In the calculation of the amount of the pension obligations, the mortality tables of the S3 Series (S3PA) were used as a basis
for consideration of the mortality also including the projection table CMI 2019 as well as the long-term trend toward improved
mortality of 1.25%. Fluctuation assumptions are no longer relevant for the pension plan.

In Switzerland, every employer must offer its employees a pension plan in accordance with federal pension law (Bundesgesetz
über die berufliche Alters-, Hinterlassenen- und Invalidenvorsorge – BVG). Employees whose salary exceeds the entry limit
must be insured – this is re-determined periodically. The BVG requires a minimum plan (the “BVG minimum”) that must always
be covered. The Swiss benefit plan at STADA includes benefits in case of death, disability, departure and upon reaching retirement age. The annual pension is calculated based on a savings account and conversion rate determined according to the age
of retirement. Plan participants can opt for a capital option. In the calculation of the amount of the pension obligations, the
BVG 2015 GT mortality tables were used as a basis for consideration of mortality and fluctuation under consideration of future
improvements in mortality rates according to the CMI model.

Various Group companies additionally grant their employees defined contribution plans. Here, Group companies pay defined
contributions to independent institutions to meet legal or contractual requirements or on a voluntary basis; liabilities beyond
this do not exist. The contributions for defined contribution plans, which are reported as an expense in the respective period
in the relevant functional areas, amounted to €32.3 million in financial year 2020 (previous year: €28.6 million).

**43. Notes to the cash flow statement**

Cash flow from operating activities consists of changes in items not covered by capital expenditure, financing, changes in
exchange rates from the conversion of foreign financial statements or transactions in foreign currencies or through changes
in the scope of consolidation and measurement. Cash flow from operating activities amounted to €391.6 million in the reporting year (previous year[1)]: €484.3 million). This development was mainly attributable to significantly higher cash outflows from
working capital, particularly for inventories and trade accounts receivable. This resulted, among other things, from an increase
for the companies and product portfolios acquired in the 2020 financial year while they were part of the Group. In addition,
there were higher income tax payments than in the previous year. The increase in other non-cash income and expenses compared with the previous year resulted in particular from higher inventory write-downs and significant additions to provisions
for damages in Germany and the CIS region.

Cash flow from investing activities reflects the cash outflows for investments less proceeds from disposals. This amounted to
-€1,225.3 million in the reporting year (previous year: -€265.0 million).

In financial year 2020, cash outflows for investments in intangible assets amounted to €433.2 million (previous year:
€161.7 million). Of this amount, €407.8 million (previous year: €135.1 million) was attributable to payments for significant
investments in intangible assets for the expansion of the product portfolio which, with €313.1 million, related to the acquisition of a branded products portfolio from GlaxoSmithKline. Within the scope of business combinations, there were net payments
from the acquisition of the Czech Walmark Group, the acquisition of the product portfolio from Takeda (incl. VAT) and the
acquisition of the Swedish Lobsor Pharmaceuticals in the total amount of €731.1 million.

Proceeds from the disposal of non-current assets amounted to €4.8 million in the financial year (previous year: €31.5 million).
Proceeds from the disposal of shares in consolidated companies as well as from the disposal of non-current assets held for
sale resulted in the reporting year from the sale of the Argentinian company Laboratorio Vannier as well as the British companies Slam Trading Limited and LAS Trading Limited.

Cash flow from financing activities includes payments from changes in financial liabilities, for dividend distributions and from
additions to equity. In addition, since the 2020 financial year, interest paid has also been reported in cash flow from financing
activities; the previous year’s figures have been adjusted accordingly. Cash flow from financing activities amounted to
€911.7 million in the 2020 financial year (previous year[1)]: -€372.4 million).

This development was mainly attributable to the following significant effects: There were significantly higher cash inflows
from the borrowing of funds. Among other things, Nidda Healthcare Holding GmbH issued a bond with a nominal value of
€350.0 million in the first quarter of 2020. A further bond with a nominal value of €200.0 million was issued in the second
quarter of 2020. Under the syndicated loan agreement, a further credit facility with a total nominal amount of €260.0 million
was made available to the Company. In addition, further loans were taken out in the Group. In addition, payments were received
from an escrow account in connection with a bond issued in the fourth quarter of 2019 with a nominal value of €600.0 million
to finance the Takeda acquisition, the closing of which took place in the first quarter of 2020. In addition, cash flow from
financing activities was significantly influenced by the acquisition of additional shares in STADA from minority shareholders
as well as the payments in the context of the squeeze-out. Further cash outflows from the change in minority interests resulted
in connection with further share acquisitions in the Vietnamese subsidiary Pymepharco.

Payments for dividend distributions amounted to €19.0 million related entirely to dividends paid to the non-controlling shareholders within the STADA Group.

Free cash flow as the sum of cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from investing activities amounted to -€833.7 million in financial year 2020 (previous year[1)]: €219.3 million).

Cash pursuant to IAS 7 is made up of cash and cash equivalents.

1) The previous year’s figures were adjusted in accordance with IAS 8 as part of a change in
presentation for interest paid. Presentation of interest paid no longer occurs within cash flow
from operating activities, but in cash flow from financing activities. F-189

Free cash flow, adjusted for effects from payments for significant investments and acquisitions and effects of proceeds from
significant disposals is calculated as follows:

in k € **2020** **2019[1)]**

Cash flow from operating activities 391,603 484,273

Cash flow from investing activities -1,225,343 -264,988

+ payments for investments in business combinations in accordance with IFRS 3 (incl. VAT) 731,053 47,538

+ payments for significant investments in intangible assets for the
short-term expansion of the product portfolio 407,830 135,071

– proceeds from disposals in significant disinvestments – 145

– proceeds (+) / payments (-) from disposals in consolidated companies 0 1,903

– proceeds (+) / payments (-) from the disposal on non-current assets held for sale (IFRS 5) -231 22,755

**Adjusted free cash flow** **305,374** **377,091**

**44. Contingent liabilities**

Contingent liabilities describe possible obligations to third parties based on past events but which will not become manifest
until the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events, which are not under Nidda’s control. As of the balance sheet date,
these contingent liabilities were considered improbable and are therefore not accounted for. In addition, there are also
contingent liabilities for current obligations, for which however the associated outflow of resources is not considered probable
or the amount of the obligation cannot be adequately estimated.

Contingent liabilities relate, among other things, to patent risks for certain active pharmaceutical ingredients and associated
pending or impending proceedings. The possible obligations amounted to approximately €14.2 million as of December 31,
2020 (previous year: €58.8 million). The decrease of €44.6 million compared with the previous year is mainly due to the
establishment of provisions for previously existing contingent liabilities as well as the elimination of patent risk for active
pharmaceutical ingredients.

Provisions were not created for contingent liabilities as the probability of an outflow of assets is under 50%. Outflows potentially resulting from these risks would generally be short-term.

**45. Other financial obligations**

In addition to the contingent liabilities, there are also other future financial obligations, which can be broken down as follows:

in k € **Dec. 31, 2020** **Dec. 31, 2019**

Operating lease liabilities 5,432 5,265

Other financial obligations 94,876 99,998

**Total** **100,308** **105,263**

Information on future obligations from leases includes obligations from short-term leases as well as leases for low-value assets
because these are not accounted for in other financial liabilities.


1) The previous year’s figures were adjusted in accordance with IAS 8 as part of a change
in presentation for interest paid. Presentation of interest paid no longer occurs within
cash flow from operating activities, but in cash flow from financing activities.

Total future minimum leasing payments based on leases is comprised as follows after their remaining terms:

**Lease liabilities**

in k € **Dec. 31, 2020** **Dec. 31, 2019**

Remaining term up to 1 year 4,250 3,505

Remaining terms over 1 year to 5 years 1,164 1,336

Remaining terms over 5 years 18 424

**Total** **5,432** **5,265**

The obligations for short-term leases amounted to €0.4 million as of December 31, 2020 (previous year: €0.3 million).

Lease payments in the amount of €17.5 million were recognized as an expense in financial year 2020 (previous year: €11.8 million). This included expenses in the amount of €1.2 million (previous year: €1.9 million) for short-term leases and €0.8 million
(previous year: €0.6 million) for leases for low-value assets.

Other financial obligations include long-term obligations for logistics and accounting services. In addition, bona fide contingent
liabilities in the amount of €36.0 million (previous year: €33.7 million) in Spain, Belgium and the United Kingdom and further
guarantees assumed on the part of the STADA Group are included in other financial liabilities.

Since cash and cash equivalents as well as trade accounts receivable mainly have short residual terms, their carrying amounts
as of the closing date correspond approximately to their fair value.

Deviations of the fair values from the carrying amounts occur as shown in the chart above in the case of promissory note loans,
bonds as well as liabilities to banks. The cash flows calculated by means of the current yield curve were discounted to the
measurement date to determine the fair values for liabilities to banks.

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements  |  Notes

The fair values of remaining financial receivables and of financial investments held until maturity with a remaining term of less
than one year correspond to the present values of the payments connected with the assets taking into consideration the
respective current interest parameters that reflect market and partner-related changes in conditions and expectations. Trade
accounts payable as well as remaining financial liabilities also regularly have short remaining terms so that the recognized
values approximate the fair values.

Financial assets recognized at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) include factorable receivables. These
financial assets, which are still included in trade accounts receivable, are recognized at fair value through other comprehensive
income. Changes in the fair value of these receivables – which differs from the measurement at amortized cost to only a minor
extent – are recognized through other comprehensive income in the FVOCI reserve. Included in this category are also the
shares acquired in the reporting period from the Swedish company XBrane. Because the company’s shares are traded on the
stock exchange, they have been classified in Stage 1.

In the context of the preparation of the financial statements, the allocation to the respective hierarchy levels is reviewed
according to information available on the determination of the fair values. If a need for reclassification is determined, the
reclassification is carried out as of the beginning of the reporting period. In the financial year, there were no reclassifications
among the respective hierarchy levels.

The fair values are analyzed in the context of the preparation of the financial statements. For this purpose, market comparisons
and change analyses are carried out.

Derivative financial assets (FVPL) and derivative financial liabilities (FVPL) include, as in the previous year, positive or negative
market values of derivative financial instruments (currency swaps and interest rate swaps) not part of a hedging relationship.
The fair values of currency forwards are determined using financial mathematics based on current market data provided by a
reputable information service, such as spot exchange rates or swap rates, in one system according to standardized procedures.
In the previous year, the fair values were determined using appropriate valuation models by external third parties.

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements  |  Notes

In the Group, currency forwards (EUR/RUB, EUR/CZK, EUR/USD, EUR/GBP, EUR/AUD, EUR/PLN and EUR/CHF) are designated
as fair value hedges that are concluded to hedge currency risks from intercompany loans with companies that keep their
accounting in a local currency other than euros. The changes in value of the underlying transaction which result from changes
to the respective currency exchange rates, are offset by the changes in value of the spot components of the currency forwards.
The objective of fair value hedges is to hedge against the currency risk of these financial liabilities. Credit risks are not part of
this hedging. The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is reviewed both prospectively and retrospectively on each closing
date. As of the closing date, all designated hedging relationships were sufficiently effective.

In financial year 2020, as in the previous year, there were no financial assets and liabilities allocated to hierarchy level 3 and
recognized at fair value.

46.2. Net earnings from financial instruments by valuation category

Net earnings recognized through profit or loss from financial assets and liabilities can be broken down as follows:

The disclosure of interest from financial instruments is made in financial income and financial expenses in the interest result.
Dividends received are disclosed in investment income. With the exception of the valuation results from interest rate swaps,
and/or currency swaps recognized at fair value through profit or loss, which are reported under financial income or financial
expenses and partially also in the currency translation result, disclosure of the remaining components of net earnings is made
in other income or other expenses. Earnings from the disposal of financial instruments relate to the fulfillment of currency
swaps.

46.3. Factoring

Factoring transactions with the transfer of essentially all opportunities and risks

There are revolving receivable selling agreements with banks and financial institutes (together “receivables buyers”) with the
transfer of essentially all opportunities and risks for two agreements without a general purchase limit and for two agreements
with a purchase limit of €33.9 million. The agreements have an unlimited term with regular termination possibilities, whereby
Nidda is free to decide if and in what amount the revolving nominal volume is utilized. The risks that are relevant for the risk
evaluation with regard to the sold receivables are the credit risk as well as the risk of delayed payment (late payment risk). In
return for a fixed program fee recognized in expenses at the time of derecognition, both risks are fully transferred to the buyer
of the receivable and for two programs through the payment of monthly discount fees.

The nominal volume of receivables sold but not yet paid under the factoring agreements, translated into euro, amounted to
€64.9 million on the reporting date.

Factoring transactions with distribution of essential opportunities and risks for which control of the asset
remains with the Nidda Group

There are factoring agreements pursuant to which, on a revolving basis, trade accounts receivable up to a total general purchase
limit of €135.5 million are sold to banks and financial institutes. The agreements have an unlimited term with regular termination possibilities, whereby the Nidda Group is free to decide if and in what amount the revolving nominal volume is utilized.
The risks that are relevant for the risk evaluation with regard to the sold receivables are the credit risk as well as the risk of
delayed payment (late payment risk). The credit risk is partially transferred to the buyer of the receivable. The late payment
risk continues to be borne in its entirety. The maximum credit risk to be borne, translated into euro, amounted to €1.7 million
as of the reporting date. The other credit-risk related defaults are assumed by the buyer. The late payment risk continues to
be borne in its entirety by the Group. The maximum risk of loss for the Group resulting from the credit risk and the late payment
risk from the receivables sold as of the reporting date, translated into euro, amounted to €1.6 million. The nominal volume of
receivables sold but not yet paid under the factoring agreements, translated into euro, amounted to €69.9 million on the
reporting date. The ongoing commitment of the Group as of December 31, 2020, translated into euro, amounted to €1.6 million and the carrying amount of the associated liability, translated into euro, amounted to €1.6 million.

**47. Risk management and derivative financial instruments**

47.1. Principles of risk management

The basic principles of financial policy and of financial risk management are determined or confirmed at least once annually
by the Management in the context of the budget process. Furthermore, transactions above a certain relevance threshold
determined by the Executive Board require a prior decision on the part of Management and may also be subject to approval
from the Supervisory Board. Management is also regularly informed of the nature, scope and amount of current risks.

47.2. Currency risks

The reporting and Group currency is the euro. Due to the international alignment of business activities, the Group is subject
to risks arising from exchange rate fluctuations.

On the one hand, these risks consist of potential changes in value, especially of receivables and liabilities in a currency other
than the respective functional currency as a result of exchange rate fluctuation (transaction risk).

F-196


-----

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements  |  Notes

However, the Group is only subject to this risk to a limited extent, as the company counters currency risks through, alongside
natural hedges, the use of derivative financial instruments. These are used to hedge currency risks from operating activities,
financial transactions and investments. In the reporting year, use was made of foreign-exchange futures contracts and interest/
currency swaps. The maturity dates of futures contracts are adjusted to the term of the underlying transactions. The remaining term of the contracts is currently up to one year.

In the context of the Consolidated Financial Statements, on the other hand, exchange rate fluctuations lead to an accounting
effect as a result of the conversion of the balance sheet items as well as the conversion of earnings and expenses of international Group companies with a different functional currency than euro (translation risk). The appreciation of the euro as
compared to the other currencies is generally negative and depreciation is generally positive.

Determined quantitative disclosures were made on risks in connection with currency changes by means of aggregating all of
the Group companies’ foreign currency items that are not denominated in the respective Group company’s functional currency.
In the case of hedging transactions, they are compared with the balances of assets or equity and liabilities from the aggregation. This results in the subsequent material outstanding foreign currency items as of the respective reporting dates, which
in case of a change to the foreign currency item due to a 10% appreciation or a 10% devaluation of the euro in comparison
with the respective functional currency are as follows:

**Dec. 31, 2020**

in k € **British pound** **Russian ruble** **US dollar**

Outstanding foreign currency item -291,633 -120,818 111,475

Income (+) / expense (-) from an appreciation of the euro in comparison to
the respective functional currency by 10% 27,147 -27,216 -11,147

Income (+) / expense (-) from a depreciation of the euro in comparison to
the respective functional currency by 10% -27,147 27,216 11,147

Equity increase (+) / equity reduction (-) from an appreciation of the euro in comparison to
the respective functional currency by 10% 23,549 -52,755 -11,148

Equity increase (+) / equity reduction (-) from a depreciation of the euro in comparison to
the respective functional currency by 10% -23,549 52,755 11,148

**Dec. 31, 2019**

in k € **British pound** **Russian ruble** **US-Dollar**

Outstanding foreign currency item -287,796 18,147 9,201

Income (+) / expense (-) from an appreciation of the euro in comparison to
the respective functional currency by 10% 24,931 -2,021 -51,220

Income (+) / expense (-) from a depreciation of the euro in comparison to
the respective functional currency by 10% -24,931 2,021 28,720

Equity increase (+) / equity reduction (-) from an appreciation of the euro in comparison to
the respective functional currency by 10% 22,954 -19,326 -51,220

Equity increase (+) / equity reduction (-) from a depreciation of the euro in comparison to
the respective functional currency by 10% -22,954 19,326 28,720

In this regard, any currency risk is isolated, i.e. it is taken into account without mutual dependencies.

The outstanding foreign currency items British pounds and Russian rubles relate to a balance from foreign currency holdings
from German and international Group companies in British pounds and Russian rubles and outstanding foreign currency
reserves in euro. The reported outstanding foreign currency positions in US dollars relate exclusively to foreign currency
holdings in US dollars at German and international Group companies.

F-197


-----

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements  |  Notes

The risk in connection with the outstanding foreign currency reserves in euro, from the Group’s perspective, results from the
functional currency of the respective international Group company. Overall, based on outstanding foreign currency items as
of the reporting date, an appreciation or a devaluation of the respective functional currency by 10% compared to the currencies of relevance for the Group would have led to an effect on earnings in the amount of an expense of €28.2 million (previous
year: €32.7 million) or in the amount of earnings of €28.2 million (previous year: €10.2 million).

47.3. Interest rate risks

Interest risks from the investment of financial assets as well as financial debts, stand primarily in Euro. In 2020, an average of
51% (previous year: 52%) of financial liabilities denominated in euro had fixed interest rates. Currently there are no cash flow
hedges in the form of interest rate swaps.

Existing interest rate risks are calculated using sensitivity analyses, which show the effects of changes in market interest rates
on interest payments, interest income and expenses as well as equity. The following factors – if relevant – are generally included
in the calculation:

- Changes in the market interest rate of original financial liabilities with variable interest rates that are not hedged against
interest rate risks, and

- Changes in the market interest rate of interest derivatives not part of a hedging relationship.

in € million **Dec. 31, 2020** **Dec. 31, 2019**

Income (+) / expense (-) from an increase in the market interest rate level of 100 basis points -6.3 0.3

Income (+) / expense (-) from a decrease in the market interest rate level of 100 basis points +0.4 1.9

The interest-rate risk is of secondary importance.

47.4. Default risks

The Group is exposed to a default risk in its operating business if contracting parties fail to meet their obligations. Alongside
the implementation of appropriate credit management processes, such transactions are generally only concluded with counterparties of impeccable financial standing to avoid default risks in financing activities.

Default risks also exist as a result of the supply of goods and services. Business relations are sought only with partners of
impeccable financial standing. In addition, the Group partly uses suitable measures such as guarantees, loan insurances or the
transfer of assets to safeguard itself against default risk. Past due receivables in the operating area are continuously monitored
and potential default risks are anticipated through the creation of valuation adjustments. Furthermore, there is the risk that
in a difficult economic and financial environment, national health care systems delay or fail to make payments to Group companies or business partners of the Group and that, as a result, directly or indirectly increased default risks arise. The maximum
credit default risk is calculated from the carrying amount of the financial assets recognized. In addition, the Group granted
guarantees that amounted to a total nominal volume of €36.9 million as of the reporting date (previous year: €34.4 million).
Various forms of collateral for credit securities are held, such as mortgages, bank or corporate guarantees, assignments of
receivables and pledged inventories. Furthermore, there is commercial credit insurance for certain markets and customers.

47.5. Liquidity risks

Liquidity risks may result, for example, from the loss of existing cash items, lack of availability of credit, reduced access to
financing markets or fluctuation in the operational development of business. The goal of liquidity management is to ensure
solvency and financial flexibility of the Group at all times by maintaining a sufficient supply of liquidity reserves. Financing is

F-198


-----

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements  |  Notes

obtained through short-term and long-term borrowings from banks, promissory note loans, bonds and factoring. Furthermore,
the Group also has solid operating cash flow.

47.6. Derivative financial instruments and hedging instruments

Currency risks are countered with derivative financial instruments, which are exclusively used to hedge interest and currency
risks resulting from operating activities and financial transactions. Derivative financial instruments are neither held nor issued
for speculation purposes.

The total volume of currency and interest rate related derivatives is comprised as follows:

**Total** **1,005,297** **-2,839** **1,484,822** **-15,020**

In the Group, currency forwards (EUR/RUB, EUR/CZK, EUR/USD, EUR/GBP, EUR/AUD, EUR/PLN and EUR/CHF) are designated
as fair value hedges that are concluded to hedge the currency risks from intercompany loans with companies that keep their
accounting in a local currency other than euros. The changes in value of the underlying transaction which result from changes
to the respective currency exchange rates, are offset by the changes in value of the spot components of the currency forwards.
The objective of fair value hedges is to hedge against the currency risk of these financial liabilities. Credit risks are not part of
this hedging. The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is reviewed both prospectively and retrospectively on each closing
date. As of the closing date, all designated hedging relationships were sufficiently effective. In the reporting period, new fair
value hedges with a nominal volume totaling €429.0 million were designated for reduction of the fair value risk (December
31, 2019: €284.7 million). As of December 31, 2020, currency derivatives with a net fair value of k €11 (December 31, 2019:
k -€240) were designated as hedging instruments within the scope of fair value hedges. Losses recognized in the currency
translation result in financial year 2020 of k €16,743 resulted from the carrying amount adjustment of the hedged item (previous year: k €9,237), from changes in fair values of the spot component of hedging transactions, gains of k €16,743 (previous
year: k €9,237) were recognized in the currency translation result.

**48. Related party transactions**

In the scope of the ordinary course of business Nidda German Topco GmbH and/or its consolidated companies have entered
into related party transactions. In accordance with IAS 24, “Related parties” refers to directly or indirectly controlled subsidiaries that are not consolidated due to lack of material significance, associates and joint ventures as well as affiliated
companies and persons in key positions and their close relatives. In principle, all trades were settled with related companies
and natural persons at market-rate conditions.

48.1. Transactions with related parties

Intertrust (Deutschland) GmbH provides services in the field of management in key positions, since Intertrust supplies a
managing director of Nidda German Topco GmbH and provides administrative services. The amounts for these management
and administrative services are listed in Note 49. Members of the boards of STADA Arzneimittel AG are considered as persons
in key positions of Nidda German Topco GmbH as well, and their remuneration is also summarized in the form of quantitative
disclosures under Note 49.

Share-based remuneration in the form of a share purchase plan

The main shareholders of Nidda German Topco GmbH’s most senior parent company, Nidda Topco S.à r.l., Luxembourg, have
offered a share purchase plan to selected managers of the Group, including all members of STADA’s Executive Board and some
members of its Supervisory Board (managers in key positions). Pursuant to the conditions of the offer, the managers in question are authorized to acquire a stake in a German limited partnership (GmbH & Co KG). The limited partnership stake in the
partnership amounts to €7.3 million and is held by managers in key positions (24%), other managers (48%) and the main
shareholders of Nidda Topco S.à r.l., Luxembourg, as well as third parties (28%). Accordingly, the partnership holds 8.0% of
ordinary shares issued of Nidda Topco S.à r.l., Luxembourg.

The purchase price of the limited partnership stake in the GmbH & Co KG is determined on each acquisition date on the basis
of the fair value of the ordinary shares of Nidda Topco S.à r.l., Luxembourg, and the additional special features of the program.
The fair value of the ordinary shares of Nidda Topco S.à r.l., Luxembourg, is determined on the basis of the discounted cash
flow valuation taking into account the expected cash flow from the investment in STADA as well as for the financing instru-ments issued by the Nidda Group companies. The purchase price calculation is considered to be the fair value of the limited
partnership stake in the GmbH & Co KG, but not as the granting of additional remuneration for the management. In the event
of continued employment by the company, the management will participate in the change in the fair value of the ordinary
shares of Nidda Topco S.à r.l., Luxembourg, through this investment by ultimately selling the shares together with the other
shareholders of Nidda Topco S.à r.l., Luxembourg.

Nidda German Topco GmbH Consolidated Financial Statements  |  Notes

Neither Nidda Topco S.à r.l., Luxembourg, nor Nidda German Topco GmbH or any other Group company is obligated to pay
any amount to the management under this program. In accordance with IFRS 2, the program is treated as a share-based
remuneration plan that does not grant any or no significant additional remuneration to managers.

48.2. Transactions with related companies

Bain Capital Investors, LLC, Wilmington, Delaware, USA, and Cinven (Luxco 1) S.A., Luxembourg, exercise direct joint control
over the indirect subsidiary Nidda Topco S.à r.l., which in turn holds controlling interest in Nidda German Topco GmbH via its

**49. Remuneration of the Management in Key Positions**

The core elements of the system applied for members of the Executive Board include non-performance related annual
remuneration that takes the tasks and performance of the member of the Executive Board into consideration along with a
component that depends on the achievement of annual performance goals (“Short Term Incentive”, STI). In addition to the
annual performance-related remuneration, members of the Executive Board receive a long-term planned remuneration component (“Long-Term Incentive”, LTI). The individual performance-related components are limited to a maximum amount.

The remuneration system for the Supervisory Board includes an annual fixed remuneration as well as a variable component,
depending on an average performance figure from the last three years. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board receives triple
this amount and his deputy twice the amount. In addition, Supervisory Board members receive a fixed remuneration for committee activities.

For explanations on share-based remuneration in the form of a stock purchase plan for persons in key positions, we refer to
Note 48.1.

The following independent auditor’s report (Bestätigungsvermerk) has been issued in accordance with Section 322
German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) on the consolidated financial statements and the group management
report (Konzernlagebericht) of Nidda German Topco GmbH as of and for the financial year ended December 31, 2020.
The group management report is neither included nor incorporated by reference in this exchange offer
memorandum. The above-mentioned independent auditor's report and the consolidated financial statements are
both translations of the respective German-language documents.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

To Nidda German Topco GmbH, Bad Vilbel

_Audit Opinions_

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Nidda German Topco GmbH, Bad Vilbel, and its subsidiaries (the
Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2020, and the consolidated
statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of changes in equity
and consolidated statement of cash flows for the financial year from January 1 through December 31, 2020, and notes to
the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. We have also audited the
group management report of Nidda German Topco GmbH, Bad Vilbel, for the financial year from January 1 through December 31, 2020.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit

- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU,
and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to [§ [Article] 315e Abs. [paragraph] 1 HGB

[Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of
the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at at December 31, 2020, and of its financial performance for
the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2020, and

- the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position. In all material
respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German
legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development.

Pursuant to § 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal
compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report management report.

_Basis for the Audit Opinions_

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with
§ 317 HGB in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the
Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements
and principles are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report” section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the group entities in
accordance with the requirements of German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German
professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group
management report.

The executive directors are responsible for the other information.

The other information comprises the annual report – excluding further cross-references to external information –, with the
exception of the audited consolidated financial statements, the audited group management report and our auditor’s report.

Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other
information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.

F-206


-----

In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to consider whether the other
information

- is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management report or our knowledge
obtained in the audit, or

- otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

_Responsibilityof the Executive Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements_
_and the Group Management Report_

The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e
Abs. 1 HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view
of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition the executive directors are
responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern.
In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an
intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.

Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole,
provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial
statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have
considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable
German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.

_Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements_
_and of the Group Management Report_

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides
an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the
opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our audit opinions on the
consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317
HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut
der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions
of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.

F-207


-----

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of
these systems.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates
made by the executive directors and related disclosures.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and
in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or
conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures,
and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the
consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German
commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB.

- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities
within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management
report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.

- Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with
German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.

- Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management
report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used
by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective
information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on
the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the
prospective information.

F-208


-----

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

German-language documents.

##### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

To Nidda German Topco GmbH, Bad Vilbel

**Audit Opinions**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Nidda German Topco GmbH, Bad Vilbel, and its subsidiaries
(the Group), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2019, and the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income, consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of changes in shareholder's equity and
consolidated cash flow statement for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2019, and notes to the consolidated
financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the group management report of Nidda German Topco GmbH for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2019.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted
by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § [Article] 315e Abs. [paragraph] 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, give
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2019, and of
its financial performance for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2019, and

- the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In
all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development.

Pursuant to § 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the
legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.

**Basis for the Audit Opinions**

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance
with § 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits
promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities
under those requirements and principles are further described in the "Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the
Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report" section of our auditor's report. We are
independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of German commercial and professional law, and
we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the
consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

**Other Information**

The executive directors are responsible for the other information.

The other information comprises the annual report - excluding cross-references to external information - with the exception
of the audited consolidated financial statements, the audited group management report and our auditor's report.

Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other
information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.

F-295


-----

In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to consider whether the
other information

  - is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management report or our
knowledge obtained in the audit, or

  - otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

**Responsibilities of the Executive Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group**

**Management Report**

The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all

material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant

to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true

and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive

directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of

consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability

to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going

concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless

there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.

Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole,
provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future
development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they
have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group
management report.

**Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management**
**Report**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole
provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately
presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our audit
opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with §
317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by
the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management
report.

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

  - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group
management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.
